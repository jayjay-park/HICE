13196,0,t3_1u9l7s,From what I have come to understand regarding the boys crisis in education there are two distinct areas where boys are having problems. The first is in noncognitive skills. I assume this to be referring to behavior organization and homework. If the typical boy and the typical girl receive the same test grades the girl will receive a better grade at the end of the course because she is more amenable to the learning process. Whether this is due to biology energy roughhousing etc. or socialization boys and girls agree school is for girls girls are smarter teachers like girls better... I have no idea. The second is reading and writing they are really struggling. Maybe find subjects they love and incorporate reading and writing assignments based on those themes. If I were a teacher and I wanted to reach boys I would focus on techniques to improve boys organizational skills present clear rules with clear consequences and try to bring my instruction out of the books and into the room a little. By showing and demonstrating as much as I could. Make concepts and theories D if you will. I would also make sure to reinforce to them school education and the quest for knowledge is every bit a boy thing as much as it is a girl thing. Boys can be a handful no doubt. But having coached some for quite some time I also know that if they know you truly support them and they know you have their back they will walk through fire for you. You can make such a substantial difference in their lives. Edit I also want to add competition. I dont know how you would incorporate this in to the classroom but I know many boys love competition. Be it a spelling bee contests of knowledge historical facts what have you... little things like that can create a buzz and may spark some boys interest. Also added reading and writing... I really should have thought this out before hitting the save button. ,MensRights,cefxqab,8,t5_2qhk3

50538,0,t1_cek5rqy,The problem is that youre facing a double standard within society that is fueled by other double standards.        Theres been a huge effort during the last few decades at making it politically incorrect to judge a woman by her appearance. Men havent been the benefactors of as much of an effort  aside from certain groups the physically handicapped for instance there hasnt been much energy directed toward ending the shaming of men for being unattractive. So its politically incorrect to reject a woman based on her looks but not to do the same to a man.        Theres also been a big effort to treat womens bodies as something special and wonderful and again men havent been the benefactors of as much of an effort. While theres nothing wrong with celebrating the human body that uneven approach has exacerbated the double standard on appearance.         Then theres the double standard on autonomy. The friends who are mad at you probably consider your reason for rejection a violation of your exs autonomy because youre telling her she cant engineer her looks as she pleases and be considered honest by you... but they dont recognize that theyre ignoring your right to autonomy when they shame you for making a relationship choice. This is because female bodily autonomy has been emphasized for decades while again men havent been the benefactors of such an overall effort  in fact the efforts that have been made intactivism arguments for financial abortion or paternal surrender have been met with opposition.       So what youre faced with is a response to much more than the dynamics in which the circumstance exists not just the circumstance itself. It doesnt mean you actually are an asshole for basing your choice to end a relationship on something that matters significantly to you having been deceived or even for what youre perceived as caring too much about appearance. It means your friends are socially programmed to be more sympathetic to your ex because shes a woman. ,MensRights,cek6mwc,6,t5_2qhk3

Some of these people are those whose opinion matters to you their opinion might affect you  cops your bosses customers. Most of us keep giving horrible first impressions for quite some time before we wise up and clean up our image. And some of us even never quite manage to do that.The point Im trying to make is I dont think its entirely out of place to tell young boys this is how you should look. Some of that might even help them later in their life. Naturally boys shouldnt be pressurized to adhere to an unrealistic body image but I dont think HeMan is actually doing that in todays world. ,MensRights,cel2s62,1,t5_2qhk3

This is due to the fact that such ideologies are stupid.Mens Rights is about the Rights of Men  Not about any fucked up ideological narrative and it never will be.  Feminism started with an assumption it started with a narrative of male oppressor  female oppressed then through selection bias and confirmation bias it builds its theories  without disproving the null hypothesis.Unlike Feminism Mens rights should never be a close minded star chamber nor should it reject science if new evidence shows we were wrong about our belief or the adapting culture around us.  We should constantly survey the landscape to adjust how new environments affect men.  Womens Rights should take the same route instead of letting the ideology of Feminism appropriate the womens movement.  As a scientist Im naturally antiideology thus also antifeminist by extension.  If you want academia to take you seriously you can not be an ideology.  Thats what cults and churches are for.Feminism is not Womens Rights.  Feminism is an ideology and thats why its bullshit.  Womens rights does not need an ideology.  Mens Rights and Mens Studies do not need a principled ideology to guide its course either  that way leads to pain.Aside from basic human rights the MRMs concepts and opinions will do better as varied and malleable open to discussion inclusion dismissal refinement rejection etc.  We should hold our studies to a higher bar than Feminism does.  We shouldnt ignore reality or marginalize results just to prop up an ideological belief like they do.IMO all explanatory theories must be backed with factual evidence or at minimum be disprovable.  We should embrace Science not Ideology.  This is the absolute most important thing to grasp in academic Mens Studies.Additionally What it means to be a Father is a big part of what it means to be a man.

Being angry at people who dont know until after the fact and then blaming them for complicity with the systems corruption when they were simply ignorant is condemning people for lacking a godlike power of omniscience.  I find that unfair and unreasonable and I dont think I am the only one who thinks that way.You are right there are a number of feminists and just women who do gladly take from the system everything it has to offer and only cry afoul when it personally turns on them.  But while superficially nuanced this is actually a world of difference from feminists who openly advocate for the system in all its cruelty and the exact laws that make it corrupt and destructive and then cry afoul when they get bitten by their own monster.  If you have evidence for the later here Ill upvote you and join in but if you dont then the situation is reversed and she is the one who has my sympathies.  If her first knowledge of the systems corruption is it attacking her family and she is working to save people such as her husband and children from it then even if it is only personal and not general she is still personally helping the men and boys in her life the second she knew something was wrong.  What more can you reasonably ask of someone?A critical part of activism is helping people when they need help with the problems you are supposed to be active about.  When someone comes to you for help in good faith with no sign of being a raging hypocrite on the issue and you do something other then be supportive or helpful then you are being an antiactivist and it is doing more to hurt the cause then the dozens upon dozens of reddit posts you might make when there no one from outside the community present does to help it.I think your criteria of her only option for redemption for a wrong you have no evidence she even committed being that she starts devoting her life to MRA activism is completely unfair.

249664,1,t1_cf6l7mv,Just a hint maybe he is tired of hearing people complain about being too nice?I mean that was what was going through my head. see the argument in female and it makes more sense. girls with big boobs  small boobs no boobs find no man Girls over  lbs find no man Girls who are educated find no man. Yea. The problem is that the way you are you are being decent. Heck I would even go so far as to say you are moderately ok just the way you are. But there is no The universe should fulfill my wish for a woman. . If you want something from someone you automatically have to enter a compromise. That means adjust your wishes untill they match the wishes of someone else. Now just for a spin on the issue. There is someone there for you whatever you like. Just as I tell the girls who ask me why arent there any good men left It is because your definition of what is good in a man does not match the men that find you atractive enough to enter a relationship. Seriously look at the girls around you. I am willing to bet that there is at least  girls in your immediate circle of aquaintances who would not mind doing the nasty with you but the thing is you would not like them doing the nasty with you. So you go ok any girls but thoise and this is where it starts to get ridiculous. Just as the XKCD guy points out do you guess complaining that the women you find attractive do not find you atractive helps anything at all? The XKCD guys solution is simple. Stop complaining or you will get no place with your complaining instead do something about it. The same advice I would give to women who complain that all the good men are already taken by the way. Do you think labeling all the men in the world who are not taken as bad makes them want you even more is helpfull? Fuck it Imma be straight. Go in a club or any public space. Does not matter what your mpreference is. Stand at thge bar looking moderately well groomed. Chances someone in here is just as sexually fruistrated as you are and would love nothing more then to try out all these freaky sex things you allways hear about with you but does not want to be rude and is to shy to just ask.

An apostrophe should only ever be used at the end of a word to show possession of an object by that wordsubjectthing Rebeccas instead of Rebeccas when signifying Rebeccas possession of something and forums instead of forums when making that word a plural word instead of singular.Remember also to not repeat yourself as you repeat yourself one or two times and kind of droned on about feminists and FGM near the end of the chapter. Refrain from repeating yourself excessively which you didnt really do this chapter unless if you wish to put emphasis on that fact or opinion or simply want to remind the reader of a statistic.I again put emphasis on not swearing using excessive amounts of exclamation and question marks and on not capitalizing entire words for emphasis. If you dont do those things you will increase the readers respect for you and increase your chances in publishing your book.

If I have health insurance and my religious beliefs are that heart transplants are wrong... I dont get to be angry that the insurance companies uses some of the money I contribute to go towards other peoples heart transplants. gt And I agree but that is what Sandra Fluke supports. She doesnt want people to be allowed to not have contraceptive coverage.No offense but thats a twisted view of the situation. Health insurance covers whatever you need that comes from doctors and hospitals. If you dont want to ever use birth control or have a heart transplant or have a blood transfusion... that is your choice to refuse those things if you want to.But there is no picking and choosing when it comes to health insurance. You dont get to decide I want coverage for this particular  of possible illnesses but not the other  and Im only going to pay  of the price. Money paid in by men goes to treat cervical cancer money paid in by women goes to treat testicular cancer... because money from everyone goes to treat everyone.If people could be allowed to not have contraceptive coverage there would be no benefit to it. It wouldnt cost any less there would be no point to it. Though maybe it would placate some people to be allowed to choose a no birth control available option of the same insurance at the same price just so they can feel theyre doing right by God. But they certainly cannot force other people to not get certain medications or receive certain procedures.gt Despite the convoluted way in which it is done the ACA forces people to pay for other peoples contraception.This is certainly true. And there are arguments to be made about how fair or right this is. You dont get to choose what your tax dollars are spent on... but the ACA isnt funded by tax dollars.

WHERE have I said I agree with it in reverse ie. if the genders were reversed? I absolutely understand what would have happened if the genders were reversed. Me saying I disagree with the suit here doesnt mean that I am complicit with the reversal situation. Do I have the RIGHT to sue someone for pushing me in the street? Of course. Does that mean I think it should be done? No. Do I think its SEXUAL ASSAULT for waving panties in a guys face? No. These are personal choices and I am making a commentary on the entirety of American litigiousness. We sue over EVERYTHING. People dont handle their own problems. People are fired for making a gay joke. People lose their jobs for things said in private. People go to prison for pushing people.

275008,0,t1_cf91th4,Yeah that just made me cringe. It just reads as if its some halfeducated ally trying too hard and failing miserably when it comes to trans men and clarifying their position in this comic.I mean there are legitimate times when cis men not just cis hetero men though admittedly ive found most of my bad experiences have come through them really need to be mindful of themselves in certain spaces or whatnot. Like last year my schools GLBTQ resource center had a week where there were workshops educating people on transrelated stuff and it would have been awesome...if these two cis guys didnt keep derailing the workshops and taking the focus away from trans people and toward how uncomfortable they are and what issues they themselves deal with. Its like...okay...this is a workshop where trans peoples voices should be given priority. Midway through the second workshop I visited that was basically on etiquette about sex with trans people particular sexual health concerns and tips etc. I had to speak up because theyd derailed discussion for fifteen minutes over disclosure which wasnt even related to the discussion it was for if people found themselves dating a trans person and wanted to have a better idea on how to approach sex getting rid of misconceptions the importance of consent and communication etc..I mean online? People outside of minority communities enter them all the time and thats just to be expected even if it can really suck sometimes. But in person I think its totally justifiable to want to have some control over who enters a discussion. As a trans woman the amount of times Ive been talking to friends about my experiences and random people have just eavesdropped and came up to me practically demanding information? Id need more than two hands. And its annoying because I have to deal with cis folk often asserting that they know better than me about who and what I am. It can be exhausting and can ruin my day. So part of what this comic stands for? I can get it even if I feel that its exaggerating is problematic in spots and is fairly mean spirited. If the artist cut out the decoy robot and just had some panel where all of the original group stood up and held control of their space and just ignored the cis hetero men that would have been cool by me.

Its not like these gender obsessed people are going to just walk away or that men are going to aggressively campaign against the very women whos favor they seek. Feminist are powerful enough to hold back Mens Rights for decades if their own conscience didnt get in the way.  Theyve already done it. Whats changing feminism right now is their personal since of right and wrong in the face of a hard to ignore changing reality. The truth will set many free but theyre not going to abandon feminism with the power and influence its gives them. The radicals are inspired by the hatred of men to the point of being morally bankrupt while the average feminists is not.  Anyone whos been fed nothing but a mass media diet wold presume women to be far worse off than men.  Changing hearts and minds is possible but were going to need to appeal to their sense of goodness rather than overwhelm them with power that we simply dont have.  We can still be anti feminists and strive to open feminist minds through direct engagement. Cowering in the corner isnt the way to go. Besides they also have an interest in preserving and modernizing their movement. Before this is over they will have coopted most of our issues and probably engage them more effectively than we do. There is just no way we can compensate for a half century of genderwomens studies scholarship institutions crisis centers  clinics  and so forth. The goal at the moment is bringing men into the womens movements infrastructure because building a separate one for menboys would take decades.  Men as a group are still unsympathetic and will remain so relative to women.  You can see how powerful these female protective impulses are around the world.  Over powering them really isnt an option. We need to earn their respect bit by bit just like we have been doing.

The school most likely has an official maternity policy already in place and they wont change it for one person.  You may be able to negotiate for course releases duringafter pregnancy in exchange for teaching extra classes beforeafter but a one semester leave isnt going to happen.gt  A pretenure sabbatical at some point during the bottom half of my tenure clock.Also unreasonable.  Some schools have this as an established policy and some dont but they arent going to change just for you.gt  No more than three new class preps per year for the first three years.Not unreasonable although the courses she would teach depends on what their department offers and how many other philosophers they have.  Its not unheard of to request a slightly lighter teaching load during the first year when you are teaching all new preps.gt  A start date of academic year  so I can complete my postdoc.Unreasonable.  They are hiring because they have a specific need for .  If they postpone the hiring date that means they need to hire a visiting professor for  which means another expensive search.  Unless youre one of the top philosophers in the word theyre not going to postpone your hiring date and lets be real if youre taking a job at Nazareth College youre not one of the best in the world.Overall I think presenting her demands as a list instead of explaining each one of them was a mistake.  Some of them were unreasonable as well.  I dont see her list as being indicative of wanting a job at an R university I think she is just far too entitled.  Perhaps she read about aggressive negotiating strategy somewhere and decided to try it without realizing that you still need to respect what an institution is able to offer.,MensRights,cg5j20m,16,t5_2qhk3

Men who do artsrelated subjects are for some reason often automatically suspected of being gay which in our society means not manly enough in spite of the fact that the vast majority of the contributors to our artistic heritage were men and presumably gynophilic ones at that.Women on the other hand are cheered for transgressing their gender roles after all theyre sticking it to the patriarchy but if theyre gender traditional thats fine and normal too. Also frankly the issue of STEM and genderdisparities is highly complicated.Men are the clear majority in economics I think theyre still a slight majority in law and perhaps philosophy although both of those are more balanced than Econ. In other words there are maledominated humanities.There are also femaledominated areas of STEM... biology and veterinary science for example.Also whilst most people who take physics are men most men dont take physics courses in college.

626095,0,t1_cgbbm41,This has a few hallmarks of a troll post  it seems tailored to trigger an emotional reaction by presenting a classic whatif spermjacking scenario girl on pill gets pregnant to trap guy who broke up with her. Its classic because it gets discussed a lot but it gets discussed a lot because it happens so Ill bite         First dont assume that because she tells you shes pregnant that she actually is especially if shes using the claim to manipulate you or if shes asking you for abortion money.                                       Second dont assume that you cant enforce your right to a paternity test depending on circumstances. If youre in the U.S. you do have the right. You may have to go to court to do so but she cannot make a legal decision about your paternity on your behalf as long as you are aware of and involved in the situation. Find out about the putative father registry in your state if you want to establish paternity. If you suspect shes going to go after child support you do have the right to demand a paternity test be done before an obligation can be imposed on you.        Third dont assume the child is best off with the mother after birth or that youll be uninterested in raising the child once you meet him or her. Neither should you assume the opposite.        Early pregnancy is a solid reality that from the outside feels like an abstract concept. An infant is tangible and a lot harder to not respond to. At the same time pregnancy is a more tangible reality for a woman because it changes her body almost immediately.         While her manipulative use of it could be a reaction to hormonal changes or a bad response to the circumstance finding out shes pregnant now that youve split up if the pregnancy is accidental if her choice to treat her pregnancy as a tool of manipulation instead of the approach of a developing person for whose welfare she is responsible is part of a pattern of manipulative andor selfcentered behavior thats disturbing and an issue to which you ought to give careful consideration. I am not saying Ooh your ex must be nuts! Go for custody! but that you do need to weigh your level of involvement and your approach to your involvement against the existing factors each of your attitudes toward the child her mental state your mental state each of your abilities to provide for the child and whether or not either one or both of you is willing to dedicate yourselves to loving caring for and nurturing a growing developing and totally dependent person. The unfairness of the situation and the manipulative way shes handling it dont change anything about what that pregnancy represents. Dont let either cloud your focus on what is most important.    ,MensRights,cgbfrww,3,t5_2qhk3

656717,0,t1_cges8yb,gt Can we not generalise all cops as bad cops.My aunt and uncle are retired police.  They fucking hate cops.  I think its safe to say they have had more interaction with police as an agency than the average person.Damn it they want us to enforce the law but do it with kiddie gloves on.  common cop sentiment.  Just heard a variation of this at my local fast food restaurant talking to a cop.The problem is cops shouldnt be protecting citizens.  If theres a crime in progress or a crime has already been committed then sick the police dogs on em to bring the alleged perpetrator in and let a court decide what to do with them.   Its your duty to protect yourself not the cops.My little bro had to walk home past a middle school and kids there started harassing him for no reason to impress themselves I suppose.  They threw fist sized rocks at his face and he ran away.  We reported it to the police and campus police.  My brother wasnt injured so there was nothing they could do.  It was his word against theirs...  So he got a video of them throwing rocks again at himself and someone else walking by.  Still the police essentially said noharm no foul they claimed they didnt see what happened just before the video as if anything justifies stoning someone from the other side of a fence...  A couple of cars even hit the rocks in the street and complained loudly enough to get the school to ensure the road was clear st thing in the mornings just rearmed the hoodlums.These kids were actually trying to harm someone but they were minorities and the attempted victim was white.  They wouldnt even just have a police cruiser pull up and give a stern talking to the kids so theyd stop before someone got hurt which is all we really wanted.Its my brothers responsibility to protect himself even if that means walking a mile out of his way to avoid known danger.  Sucks but thats the reality of things.Until one day my brother is walking past the jrhigh with his Hispanic girlfriend...  They threw rocks again and he recorded it.  No need to see the video on that one she filed the report and the campus police finally went after the fuckers and even if there was no assault charge they got the kids suspended on threat of harassment charges  which were oddly not presented as an option for my bro.Threaten a woman cops get involved.  Threaten a man man up and protect yourself.Given that the supreme court has ruled the police have no obligation to protect anyone I think they should just butt out unless someone is actually demonstrably injured.  It may suck but it would be more fair and safer if people could have a realistic expectation of how protected you are by police Not at all.  When police rush in to save a damsel it gives the average guy the assumption that theyre not sexist and will do the same for them but as Ive seen over and over this is not the case.,MensRights,cgex2qo,9,t5_2qhk3

726846,0,t1_cgmvhah,gt If you would like insights think in the big picture. As an example the overall pay gap for women. Not this study  the general pay gap rationalizations.Aggregated data like that does not tell us what the reason for the gap is and certainly isnt comparing apples to apples.gtWithout getting into the quite obvious concept of women being passed over for promotion based on gender.Its not obvious but alright.gtLets focus on the rhetoric regarding child care. In that regard the pay inequality that effects women is directly linked to something that is an inequity to the detriment of men. Specifically paid maternity leave and lack of paid paternity leave. That alone means that in a twoparent family the most likely choice to be made is for the woman to pause her career even in cases where the man would prefer to be the one to do so.Mothers take more time off anyways even in countries with both.gt That extends out to things like overtime  the sexism knife cuts both ways. Men are given less leeway for children even if they want it dealing with the kids cuts into the womans time because it reflects less negatively on her  and so the cycle perpetuates and becomes self confirming.Its a cycle of men and women engaging in living arrangements of their own accord. Who are youor me or anyone to tell them their priorities and goals are wrong?gtThe stereotyping and unequal treatment of men based on gender directly contributes to the unequal treatment and pay gap experienced by women. So again rights are about equality.At what point do you think adults should be held accountable for their decisions?gtPlease dont take this wrong because youve been perfectly fine but this board in general disturbs me due to the dominance of blatantly sexist commentsWhat would be some examples of this?,MensRights,cgmw9rz,1,t5_2qhk3

762904,0,t3_22vlrx,gt As a result Ive had the misfortune of hearing some women express denial about the existence of male rape or sexual assault. While obviously a man doesnt always consent and a man can be raped I would like those who dont have ample evidence otherwise to consider the idea that rape might in general be different for men compared to women. While I obviously dont know anything for sure my experience has pointed towards women regretting sex a lot more than men. Ive heard lots of stories from women who are extremely upset by the results of sex. Ive never heard this from men. Again not to say it doesnt happen but perhaps men are affected by sex differently. I bring this up because Ive also noticed different responses to rape from men who bring it up. Of the men and women who come forward the men have seemed less affected. Again not that that means no men are affected. All Im proposing here is that the idea that men and women are affected by sexrape differently is not rejected without due consideration. ,MensRights,cgqzxzz,1,t5_2qhk3

That is this idea that women perform some sort of celestial act when they have a baby. Its one of those things that has become so ingrained in our culture that no one ever stops to question it except I have noted  elderly women who are by far a more practical and realistic lot. I could go on about this but my father once said something that sums it up better than I ever could.He builds custom Street Rods for a living now that he is retired. He is a purist about it refusing to use kits or fiberglass. Despite this his cars are highly customized and a great deal of them he fabricates from raw steel by hand. He is credited with several innovations that have swept across the industry and have been seen on SpeedTV TLC etc. He has also won the Street Rod Nationals despite not having the multimillion dollar sponsorships many of his competitors enjoy. He does it out of love for old cars and prefers to turn out one amazing car every  years instead of mass producing the blah.Anyway he spent almost  years on a particular car and it caused a huge stir in the Street Rod community for its creativity class and attention to detail. I was still a young man at the time and I was very proud of him. We were at a car show when a man and his wife approached my dad next to the car. The man said something to the effect that my dad should be very proud of what he had created it was such an accomplishment. At which point the wife interjected with Oh you men what do you know about creation? Youve never felt a human being grow inside of you and then brought it into the world.The husband looked mortified which I guess my father felt gave him license to respond with the following.Maam trying to compare what you did to what it took me to build this is an insult. I grew up on a farm and learned enough of animal husbandry to tell you this.  Creation is an act of will its having an idea and making it happen through years of hard work even when your told to stop or told its impossible.  You didnt create anything. You got laid and then did nothing while your body produced a child. Any barnyard animal can do it. In fact your head could be cut off and its still going to happen. So please dont try to compare my lifes work to your biological functions.Of course the woman turned red and looked horribly affronted. I expected an altercation of some sort with her husband. But instead he looked at my father and apologized for his wifes words and hustled her away.I had never given a second thought to this holiness of maternity thing until then but after that I began questioning why its treated that way when theres no real effort involved? Not to be confused with suffering which is a consequence of being pregnant and giving birth. The answer is simple and strikes at the heart of feminism. Feminists want women to be venerated for what they ARE not what they have accomplished. The new Aryan class.,MensRights,cgy28r5,2,t5_2qhk3

Norton in that debate was eloquent and explained his point so well that the crowd ended up on his side and her trying to explain why rape jokes are unfunny by saying oo i am a rapist is the reason why most women are not funny by nature. She wasnt able to use an actual rape joke because that would have proven Nortons point that jokes dont change people perception of a horrible act and it is more about the skill and genius of the comedian being able to take a horrible thing and elicit laughter from others that makes comedy an art. ,MensRights,ch04wbv,1,t5_2qhk3

Youre the one jumping to conclusions by using anecdotal evidence to wager that most do allow shorts. Anecdotal evidence is worthless.And saying because most do allow shorts doesnt take away that lots dont allow it. Obviously if there is no dress code at all then shorts will be allowed but if there actually is a dress code then shorts arent usually allowed for males. And the point of the semantics is that the comment you replied to was talking about men adults people who are not at school but at the workplace where shorts is rarely ever allowed. So in conclusion men at work cant wear shorts but women can wear skirts. Boys at school often cant wear shorts but girls can wear skirts in america whereas in other countries such as the UK shorts are practically never allowed. At work and schools where there is no dress code anyone can wear what the want obviously.  year old children are not adults.,MensRights,ch5woz5,0,t5_2qhk3

This is BillC.Heres a link to a Yahoo questions I found about the topic. This is about BillCHeres another link that I found through the Yahoo questions page where the Feminist lawyers were citing their problems with the bill. This is about BillC. Ill just copy and paste some of what the Yahoo user pasted that I think is very interesting. From Page ...gt. Legal presumptions in family law are not appropriate. Although the concept of general rules can seem appealing on first glance in application they dont work and they are not fair. The best interests of children are significantly dependent on the unique circumstances of each child and her or his family. Appropriate decisions about custody and access can only be made by a careful examination of the facts in each individual case. gtFurthermore by  we have had the opportunity to see how poorly presumptions in favour of shared parenting have worked in other jurisdictions. England Australia and some American states have implemented such regimes and the reports are not positive. Judges lawyers womens advocates and families report that litigation has increased with families returning to court again and again because of confusion over the language of parental responsibility parental conflict has increased and women have traded their economic rights to ensure appropriate custody outcomes. Heres a little of what the Yahoo user said in relation to the NAWL.CA document I sampled above which Ill copy and paste too instead of rephrasing it. I think its apposite. gtThe courts forcing shared custody arrangements on parents is not always the right solution. Sometimes it can work and the courts should still be encouraged to pursue it if its a viable and fair option. But each custudy case still needs to be judged on its individual circumstances for the best interests of the child to be properly consideredYou also mentioned there were two cases? I dont know know the specifics of BillC but it looks like from this link that it uses the same flawed wording that NAWL.CA had a problem withIt forces  split between custody and time.With just a tiny bit of research I easily found itas I thought this was more complicated then just Feminists are enforcing the gender stereotypes. I always find it pathetic when people dont do their own research on something theyre not sure on and instead opt for assuming the worst. These feminists lawyers are opposing equal custody? They must hate men and are enforcing the gender stereotypes. Amirite or amirite guys?? When you do shit like this it really says A LOT about your personal biases flaws and your incompetence at responsibly consuming information.Im not saying YOU think that Im not sure where you stand and your comments sounded somewhat neutral on it.

If Im not mistaken one of the most common of the logical fallacies is the argumentum ad hominem attack. Maybe you should google it? Might be up your alley given your last comment.I disagree that believing that womens dress should be as scrutinized and held to the same high standard as mens means that the men in the office have the right to decide what type of womens clothes are appropriate. Some people think open toed shoes are unprofessional. Some people think it depends on the context. Some people dont care either way. I think its weird when men talk about wanting to enforce their preferences for womens clothing under the guise of equality. Kind of like when some guys on reddit get REALLY pumped by videos of men hitting women if they deserved it.

1125097,0,t1_chvy22i,Losing weight with this diet of yours of McDonalds or as someone suggested in reply to me chocolate bars due to low calories intake is the same to gaining weight through eating a lot of shit. It is not the point of the discussion. Both losing weight and gaining weight in a healthy way take similar amounts of effort. I am not from America and it seems to me there are plenty of fat fucks there who bathe on mountain dew and have all their meals on KFC. For these people yes simply eating less highly caloric food can help. However there are plenty of overweight people not necessarily obese with decent food habits and not completely sedentary who cannot lose weight.This is not a simple formula as weight difference  energy intake  energy expenditure as much as it intuitively seem that way. Anyone who has studied a fair bit of biochemistry can tell you that. Your body does not absorb or stores all forms of energy the same way at all times. This is the reason low carb diets work amazingly on the short term  you trick your organism in thinking it hasnt gotten any real food minimizing insulin release and literally not absorbing fat. You could eat a bucket of lard that way and it would make almost no difference without any insulin. The problem with this as I said is that it is not only unsustainable in the long term but worst for your health overall. When you have any fallback your body will go berserk and absorb every shit it can making you probably worse than you were off to begin.

There are certain people in the world who will spew bullshit about the MRM mostly stuff they heard from somebody else who just plain made it up and actively try to prevent these ideas from gaining any sort of social acceptance. Whether you like it or not feminism as a whole does not accept the MRM and this is exactly why. Your friends viewpoint is not an uncommon one at all especially among feminists and its one perpetually entirely by feminism. It may not be true of all feminists but enough of them believe such nonsense that Im wary of anyone who calls themselves a feminists right from the start.Theres more to it than this but I didnt want to post a massive wall of text that was only tangentiallyrelated. What it comes down to though is that Im all for every human on this planet to have the same rights but feminism has an ideological base that I cannot agree with. Even if the MRM hate went away wed likely not have enough common ground on which to work together to solve issues either in ideology or methodology. How could we when we cant even agree on the state of the past or the world as it is today? We couldnt even agree on what problems exist or if we could theyd just not be taken seriously.

1171871,0,t1_ci1dmkz,Well they see it as only a step down for men as if being compared to a woman is to be called weak.  Really its to be called undesirable to women.  Men are judged on how they actwhat they do so if a guy acts like a woman hes going to be judged harshly.  Its not because femininity is seen as innately bad its just that women dont tend to like it in men.  On the other hand masculinity is not seen as innately good either.  Women are judged on the way they look so if you tell a woman that she has a manly build chances are she wont take it as a compliment on her strength because youre basically saying that shes undesirable to most men.  Saying a woman looks like a man is a downgrade to a woman.Feminists ignore the latter and focus on the former.  Men dont like to be told theyre acting like women and women dont like to be told they look like men.  These things are both related to the ways in which men and women are judged and they both indicate undesirability.  Its not that one or the other is seen as inferior.  I think that humans are inclined to have an opposites attract line of thinking and this gets self policed by men and women.  If you cant be the opposite of whatever youre trying to attract youre not that likely to attract anything.  Has there ever been a culture in which men and women dont try to set themselves apart in some way?  If this thing is really going to be attributed to patriarchy then I think it must first be proven that men and women wanting to be seen as different from each other on some level is really just a social construct.  I dont see that happening.  Presenting yourself as something different to the opposite sex is a way of saying You dont have this but I do we could be good together.

1186978,0,t3_27ppks,i think that most feminists and MRAs are decent people with real problems who have been screwed over by someone. unfortunately there are vocal radicals in both groups. luckily the MRA is so small that there arent many radicals that are organizing major events or getting a lot of publicity. but feminism is a much older movement and so it has some radicals that have gained traction over the years. in order to not help shield radicals i refuse to call myself an MRA or a feminist. i call myself an egalitarian. as an egalitarian i agree with many stances held by both MRAs and feminists. i do NOT agree with all of the ideas of MRA or feminism i do not believe in patriarchy i do not believe that evolution alone explains the socialsexual relationship behind modern humans. my stance does not hold an explanation for WHY people should be treated as equal it only states that people should in general be treated as equally and fairly as possible. my particular opinion is that this is because of subjective morality and that there is no clear line to be drawn to say that X is better than Y so in essence discriminating against X is a form of tyranny even if it is justice in another moral reference frame. so go judge people by your own moral reference frame. i imagine most of our internal concepts of morality have a great deal of alignment and that this is most likely do to evolutionary pressures. but i wont be backing radicals because i think that they spread tyrannical concepts. ,MensRights,ci35jrb,1,t5_2qhk3

1220399,0,t3_2827n3,This is very interesting. DeCrow obviously has a lot in common with Farrell. I had never heard of her. Thanks for posting.I think this is really interesting because like Farrell she has started with feminist principles of rational social equality for women as human beings but then not shied away from the implications of these principles for men. In other words if there are things men must give up for women to achieve equality there are things women must give up too for just the same reason. It was that strict adherence to rationalism that led to a divergence between her and other feminists as feminism increasing fell in the grip of antirationalism and postmodernism. In a sense she and Farrell are the true feminists and socalled feminists in a covetous bid for female power at any price and a puritanical need to condemn men and vilify male sexuality and all expressions thereof have more in common with hysterical moral conservatives and paternalists of the old school than with the original spirit of feminism.  I know that many here will say that feminists have not adhered to their principles in practice but here is one who did and look what became of her. She became an MRA. The MRM is the fulfillment not the contradiction of at least part of what previously passed for feminism and I think its incredibly important for us to realize that.,MensRights,ci6wvt9,28,t5_2qhk3

How fathers are portrayed in TV shows and the media. How fatherhood is becoming more important to men even when under attack from feminism who wants to make damn sure that mens only role is to act like a walletHe hits on how democrats the generally more progressive group wont advocate for fathers because that would lose them support of women who are the majority of voters. Republicans wont advocate for fathers because they tend to view men as disposable and deal with understanding how sending so many black fathers into prison for marijuana has had a negative affect on that particular group. They might also have to consider passing laws that would force companies to give paternity leave.There isnt much left for men to feel proud of anymore. Being happy to be a man is seen by some as misogynistic and merely a consequence of the patriarchy. So perhaps being a father is one of the few remaining things left for men?

1250296,0,t1_cia8ysd,Im just about wholly in agreement with you on point . I think you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say there. I think it is perfectly reasonable for them to be afraid of men for a time after the event but then they need to get professional help in order to help relieve the mental issues caused by trauma. Exactly. Its not healthy or good to be afraid of or hate men because one has fallen victim to them but is is understandable I argue. It need not be condoned but it should be recognized for what it is a defense mechanism. On  I meant simply that the defense mechanism that takes the form of if attacked by an x beware all x is natural and bound to happen. That is we see if frequently and it is something that generally has to be unlearned retaught.  Youre talking about situations in which other factors are known. Im talking about situations in which other factors are not known. For example  if the setting of the scene the persons demeanor dress gait props etc. are all the same except for the factor were controlling for race gender it is perfectly reasonable to assess the risk percentage for danger by the male passerby as higher than for the female passerby. I would almost say the same thing for a black vs white man walking by except that I cannot prove this but it is a hunch I expect that it is much easier to profile and differentiate what kind of black person is likely to commit a violent crime and what kind is not versus what kind of male is likely to rape and what kind is not. I have this suspicion because whereas a lot of violent crime happens in urban poor sectors of the black community rape by men against women transcends class race status etc. and frequently is reported to be committed by someone who seems to be just a normal guy. ,MensRights,cia9v0a,0,t5_2qhk3

1254756,0,t1_ciad97q,gt This is feminist nannystate nonsense deliberately designed to crush these boys spirits to turn them into quiet subservient shutupandlisten types.  Id like to write a bit more about the mechanism the intermediate steps.  The idea isnt simply that boys will be subservient because they wont seek to play cops n robbers.  The idea is that they will be subservient as a result of their being punished powerfully in an arbitrary way.  Or to put it another way play guns arent targeted because theyre violent theyre targeted because theyre male.  Find something that every male naturally does and then criminalize it.  This turns the boys into a criminal class.  In the environment of school control is so regimented that there is basically no upside to being a criminal class and the result is that boys are disempowered by being painted both externally and in their own minds as defective outofcontrol idiots whose natural impulses are dangerous to those around them.  In classical conditioning terms these teachers arent associating guns with punishment  instead they are associating the playful instinct with punishment.  They are demanding that these boys build a layer of brain software dedicated to filtering each of their fun instincts according to a mental map of what they think the teachers will want.  Of course that sounds natural  that people should learn to control their impulses  but instead of teaching them to control their impulses in a constructive way instead they are simply setting up huge blockages toward any expression of creative energy.  Impulse inhibition is not itself a good thing  it is only useful when targeted toward truly harmful behaviors.  Setting up randomly administered and randomly scaled punishments tends to prohibit the brain from developing any sort of useful model of causeandeffect to connect to that impulse inhibition and instead the impulse inhibition itself just grows and grows in strength until the boy simply stops venturing out to do things creatively or offscript.  In psychology this is called learned helplessness and is exemplified by a dog in a cage with two floor panels and a little fence to hop over this is the experimental setup used to identify and characterize this behavior by Martin Seligman.  The dog receives some kind of unpleasant stimulus  like a loud tone or a shock and freaks out until it discovers that by hopping over the fence it can make the stimulus stop.  The next time the stimulus happens the dog is quick to hop that fence to turn the stimulus off.  Dogs who are put in this situation come out of it just fine.  Other dogs are put in this situation except when the stimulus happens there is no way to turn it off.  Hopping the fence does nothing.  Very quickly these dogs end up just lying down and whimpering under the painful stimulus and not doing anything else.  This condition where they have learned that there is nothing they can do to avoid punishment is called learned helplessness.  If you take an LH dog and put it back into a situation where it has control again the dog will not use that control.  An LH dog will not hop the fence will not press a lever even if earlier it was trained and taught that doing so would stop the stimulus.  Even though it knows the relationship and that it has or at least might have the power to turn off the stimulus the LH dog does nothing  it just takes the punishment suffers and lies there whimpering.  Later on these dogs are depressed and unhealthy.  The learned helplessness translates into other situations  the dogs dont try very hard or at all with anything.  You can beat one of these dogs and it wont fight back.  In human terms long before Seligmans experiments and his coining the phrase this state was and still is known as broken.  And this brings us back into the world of humanity to what humans can do to other humans.  Learned helplessness even though it wasnt named has been a part of human interaction for a long time.  People of all shapes and sizes have been trained into learned helplessness and often it is actually on purpose.  Slaves are savagely beaten if they attempt to escape.  Abused spouses commonly believe there is nothing they can do to stop the abuse  and even when presented with ideas they simply dont try them.  The key ingredient in creating learned helplessness is randomness.  Punishment must come at random times and be completely unavoidable.  There must be literally nothing that the target can do to avoid the punishment.  They must literally be helpless.  If you can achieve that state of affairs then very quickly their brain will switch into a learned helplessness mode and that LH will stick with them long after theyve moved on.  Taking a kid who is carefree playing with this classmates in a completely benign manner and suddenly plucking him out of that situation and punishing him for something he had no idea was a crime is the random stimulus.  Giving no recourse no chance to modify the play no warnings and no notification of the set of rules which might lead to punishment all of this adds up to essentially random punishment.  And if you can pick the crimes such that they match a particular target group of people well then youve got an easilyjustified recipe for mass induction of learned helplessness.  In short you get to turn whole swaths of people into quiet subservient shutupandlisten types.,MensRights,ciarwxc,5,t5_2qhk3

1307397,0,t1_cigm5tx,gtIm really becoming aware of the degree to which men arent supposed to have agency in sexgtYou wont find many people who would think for a minute that men arent allowed to have choice or standards in their sexual partners but that is exactly what our societies ingrained injokes and norms seem to perpetuate.I dont think a lack of agency is what men are experiencing. I think this is a sideeffect of hyperagency.I would argue that women dont have agency in sex since society traditionally says that sex is something a man does to a woman not something they do jointly together. Ie the main is acting and the woman is being acted on. If anything bad happens regarding the sex its never the womans fault no agency its always the mans fault. As a result we have the view that men can never be victims the way an adult who has agency cant be victim of a child who has no agency. In addition because we have hyperagency while women have a lack of agency we are expected to do all the wooing. We are expected to take action and persuade women into having sex. Again were expected to be actors whilst women are expected to be acted on. This has led to the view that men should always want sex and if you dont want it then you must be less of a man typically HE MUST BE GAY. And on the flipside if a woman steps outside her role and takes agency going after men she wants then she runs the risk of being called a slut dirty etc.However because of feminism and the whole campaign about maleonfemale violence objectification etc were at a point where in many situations men are both shamed for not wanting sex and also shamed when they DO want sex and the woman doesnt return their affections. If youre a man you cant win there youre either a pussy or a creep. Sometimes I envy our gay MRA bros and I count myself lucky I found myself a lovely lady who isnt functionally retarded like the people shaming male sexuality.Obviously this is a massive generalization.

1328988,0,t1_cij4fz7,Thats because they werent raped as per the defintions provided.All they are doing is dispensing information. Under their definition of rape which is a very legitimate one in the context of the survey males DO perpetrate most all rape and mostly women are raped. Thats a fact using the definitions provided in the survey. It has nothing to do with social constructs only with data. Its not their fault you cant properly read and contextualize the data. They are not sexist because you refuse to use their operational definitions and accept their motivations for those definitions. Youre free to dispute those definitions but as of yet youve provided zero counterarguments as to why these two definitions are sensible and important to the collection AND analysis of the data. In the same vein most victims of being forced to penetrate are male and assaulted by females. They arent misrepresenting at all you just cant realize that A. they are required to categorize like this in order to do good data collection and thus good science and B. not including them amongst rape victims does not emphasis rape over other forms of sexual assault it does the opposite! It specifically calls attention to a form of sexual assault that effects almost ONLY males and thus calling attention to a crime done mostly by females but plenty of guys too. If they were all lumped as rape victims in the survey it would require subdivision of the data to get a full picture of the demographics. By separating the physical acts based on their physical differences being penetrated versus penetrating we get a clearer and more accurate picture.Like I said before I agree that legally both acts should fall under rape simply for the sake of consistency in sentencing. And indeed socially both acts should be considered equally reprehensible and thus applying the word rape to both seems fine to me. What you dont seem to realize is that this report does nothing to prevent that. All the terminology exists only within the context of the survey so that data can be collected and compiled efficiently nothing more. The data between the two separate groups can be EASILY compiled into one by the legal system and we individually can look at the data and put them together in our head if we want to analyze the data more macroscopically but the reserve is not true. If the distinctions were never made we couldnt extract much data concerning the acts individually. Its better to have more categorically specific information to generalize later than the other way around.Just because youd rather have everything line up sociolingusitcally is a terrible excuse to encourage shitty science and its a horrible reason to accuse people who are doing good science that they are somehow sexist or socially irresponsible.,MensRights,cij4my2,-1,t5_2qhk3

1363506,1,t3_29p5qp,The problem isnt Radical Feminism. The problem isnt most naive selfdescribed Feminists.The problem is the ideology of Feminism itself.The problem is the idea of patriarchy which implies that all men are responsible for our social problem and all men benefit at the expense of women.The problem is latent encouragement of violence towards men in media as some sort of twisted female empowerment.The problem are mainstream journalists and academics who uncritically report bogus statistics such as women earn  cents for every dollar men earn or  out of  women will be raped in college. that get a lot of social equity poured into nonproblems the socalled wage gap not college rape.The problem is that feminists simply do not have the empathy to see that being falsely imprisoned for rape is a hugely damaging and traumatic thing. Ive never talked to a Feminist who could even admit that being put in prison for years and forever branded a rapist might be at least as traumatizing as rape itself. They just arent able to put themselves in another persons shoes enough to even conceive of this.The problem is that almost all Feminists will stick their fingers in their ears when any discussion of governmental discrimination against men comes up.The problem is a media sphere that tries to make women feel constantly afraid and perpetual victims.The problem is Feminist promoted views that men initiate virtually all violence in society and female violence is rare as hens teeth.In short as is so often the case with human society the problem is false and destructive ideas and thought patterns.Feminism is so deeply convinced that being born a man in society is only an advantage and being female only a disadvantage that when they think of equality they think that the only valid actions to promote this are those that help women. Males have it made already. They dont need any help.This makes it really hard to work together with the Feminist for the betterment of humanity. Remember in mainstream Feminists thought men can only be allies and the most important thing we can do as men to promote Feminism is to sit down and shut up. Male advocacy is openly and widely mocked even in prominent mainstream publications.Feminism as a movement might might not hate men but Feminism as a movement is certainly not at all concerned with the issues men face or what can be done to help them.Feminists talk about caring about mens issues and occasionally they might help men as a side effect of helping women but when it gets right down to it they spend  of their time advocating for issues that primarily affect men and boys.,MensRights,cin7e0r,2,t5_2qhk3

1411326,0,t1_cit3ev6,Women have a lot of privileges and rights that men dont so I can see why employers would prefer to employ men  cheaper and less trouble.   But this isnt a womans issue because its simply an inherent part of the privileges they have over men.  So its a mens issue because the issue is about discrimination against men not women.Similarly that women can afford to have a larger range of choices when it comes to employment and balancing work and home life is a privilege that women have.  The issue is a mens issue.  Its happening because of discrimination suffered by men.The idea that female victims of rape are denigrated is complete bullshit when compared to how much male victims of rape are denigrated  by feminist especially.  In many countries male victims of rape are not even recognised by law and in most places they face a lot of discrimination in terms of services and help.Im not even sure what you are trying to say in the th paragraph but I do recognise benevolent sexism as the code word feminists use for female privilege.  As for double standards thats another feminist code word for pretending some bullshit is against women when its always really against men.  In this case promiscuity and sex in general men are viciously attacked constantly and the sexuality demonized constantly.  Women are never attacked like that.,MensRights,cit6tmg,5,t5_2qhk3
1413351,0,t1_cit8j8e,gt only one grade of FGM is anatomically equivalent to MGM  specifically clitoral hoodectomyThat seems a very reasonable view that I myself held until I started reading the relevant medical and scientific knowledge and research into these areas.We are lucky there is so much great knowledge aroundAccording to a number of leading researchers and scientists  including Ken McGrath Senior Lecturer in Pathology at the Faculty of Health Auckland University of Technology neurologically speaking removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females.Homology vs NeurologyIn order to understand this subject fully you can really benefit from a complete and comprehensive dissemination of the structure function and  anatomy of the male and female genitalia and the associated medical and scientific research in these matters.Watch this great video. Totally professional and insightful. Amazing. So much great knowledgeKen McGrath Senior Lecturer in Pathology at the Faculty of Health Auckland University of Technology and Member of the New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Scientists discusses his research into the neural anatomy of the human penis and the physical damages caused by circumcision.McGrath is author of The Frenular Delta A New Preputial Structure published in Understanding Circumcision A MultiDisciplinary Approach to a MultiDimensional Problem Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Genital Integrity Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights in the st Century held December   in Sydney Australia.Abstract Textbooks and papers referring to penile function state that the source of penile sensation is solely the glans and often justify the existence of the prepuce by stating it protects the sensitive glans. These statements are contrary to the neuroanatomical and physiological facts accumulated over more than a century. This study reviews the findings of Taylor et al. that the prepuce is the primary sensory platform of the penis and describes a new preputial structure.This interview was taped in Berkeley California ....and from the Global Survey of Circumcision HarmRemoval of the male foreskin and the female clitoral hood female foreskin are anatomically equivalent. However neurologically speaking removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females. This video discussion of penile and foreskin neurology explains why. Contrary to popular Western myth many circumcised women do report the ability to feel sexual pleasure and to have orgasm albeit in a compensatory manner that differs from intact women suggested reading Prisoners of Ritual by Hanny LightfootKlein. Similar compensatory behaviours for achieving orgasm are at work among circumcised men who must rely on the remaining  or less of their penile nerve endings. Just as clitoridectomized girls grow up not knowing the levels of pleasure they could have experienced had they been left intact so too are men circumcised in infancy unaware of the pleasure they could have experienced had they not had  of their penile skin removed. The above video also explains whats really behind the erroneous comment made by some circumcised men that they couldnt stand being any more sensitive..Heres how the penis and the clitoris both develop separately from the genital tuberThe male foreskin and female clitoral hood are anatomically equivalent but equivalent is an everyday way of explaining it. The proper term is homology.In the context of sexual differentiationthe process of development of the differences between males and females from an undifferentiated fertilized eggthe male and female organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue. A typical example is the ovaries of female humans and the testicles of male humansSo the clitoris and penis may be said to be homologous and the same can be said of the foreskin and clitoral hood. But that does not mean they have the same function or scale. For instance the male foreskin in a adult is around  to  square inches in size whilst the female clitoral hood is much much smaller. An analogy can be made to male and female breast tissue as both are homologous. But of course female breast tissue is much much larger than male breast tissue and the female breasts have multiple important functions.You cannot really equate amputation of male breast tissue with amputation of female breasts.Also please do remember that the clitoris is a very large organ most of which is internal to the female.The visible part  the glans clitoris  is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing the crime of FGM only a small part of her clitoris is removed.You can read a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the foreskin here. This relies on research in the British Journal of UrologyForeskin Sexual FunctionCircumcision Sexual DysfunctionBritish Journal of UrologyFinetouch pressure thresholds in the adult penisMale circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohortConclusion What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the male? The foreskin with its  nerve endings. What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the female? The glans clitoris with its  nerve endings. Hence Ken McGraths conclusion neurologically speaking removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females.,MensRights,citfy0l,10,t5_2qhk3

There is certainly room for trans people if they choose to be a part of the MHRM I think. We dont hold things like privilege as having a lot of weight so we dont see someone crossing gender lines as being for ulterior motives. No one will be labeled a gender traitor here and I can be pretty confident in stating that. Regardless of how a nonbinary person identifies if at all a part of the MHRM overlaps with the issues they would face either socially or legally I suspect. Im largely just speculating though. It seems right but I am a bit tired right now so cant really articulate anything more than that at the moment. For the most part though there seems to be a concerted effort to not coopt issues from other groups. The GSM community is represented already so poking into that could be viewed as unwelcome. Speaking personally and in complete candor issues facing the trans community seem complex and unfamiliar to me so its hard to really know how to best support them from an MRA perspective.Not for lack of willingness though.

The body of evidence that is the society we live in clearly demonstrates that the cause of Mens Rights is widely UNPOPULAR! On top of that only a tiny number of people who frequently engage in the gender dialog online even know it exist despite it being roughly as old as womens liberation. The Prima Facie case suggest nobody even knows what the hell it is while feminism literally runs the dialog on gender in America.   Getting attention for the issues of men and boys is a uphill battle because feminist have intentionally discouraged the society from focusing on mens issues over generations. Neither men nor women know the issues.  Those who advocate for men get less support and attention. Male problems once discovered are downplayed right away to eliminate the threat of people viewing males as victims.   Men are screwed and having men in powerful roles has done nothing to improve their situation. gtAnother that Ive thought of could be that depending on the political pull of women it may not matter much the percentages of representation of men if theyre beholden to women for reelection then womens interests will be represented.That logically would come first but youre still wrong.  The issue is lobbying power.  Thats why you see tens of millions spent on clean coal commercials.  Thats why our presidential elections cost  billion dollars. Influencing the voters and our leaders cost but in feminisms case the cost is born by activist working for free to get the word out about the latest oppression meme being pumped out the echo chamber.  Men have nothing that effectively competes with the thousands of feminist controlling the social sciences and humanities in American Education or its cascading influence through popular culture.  Power needs to be looked at in practical terms and not the framing created by feminist to serve their own deceptive agenda. gtHowever there are obvious criticisms that I can think of right off the top of my head regarding both these ideas. In response to the first if we assume a dichotomy between mens rights and womens rights a zero sum game possibly?Oppression by an ideology controlling speech and thought to deny a half of humanity equal compassion is pretty zero sum.  Feminist oppression and they are oppressors is a source of power.  Mens Rights cant rise without the oppressor giving up power. The zero sum question is not between womens rights versus mens rights but the power of an ideology that is used to determine whos needs ar taken seriously by institutions. ,MensRights,ciyxg0f,12,t5_2qhk3

Any place where there are people you will have men approaching women women approaching men men approaching men and women approaching womenthough generally the onus to approach is still primarily placed on men.  Male scientists are still people. They arent eunuchs.  They are still willingable of having sex and are still longing for the same love and attention as everyone else is.  In the cases of legitimate harassment please deal with it accordingly but when youre hating on men for being human and calling them creepspredators just because they happen to be human while maleampnerdy you are unfairly demonizing and belittling those men.  Also... women dont join stem fields because they dont have the same interest in stem fields that men do because they prioritize other pursuits and because all kinds of other opportunities available to them from the moment they start high school.  If women dont want to join fields as a result of men coming on to them they wouldnt join any fields that were male dominatedlaw accounting medicine etc. The issue in this case isnt that men are coming on to them the issue is that the men coming on to them arent JQ models that exert strength power and masculinity and women want to hold the right to be prejudicedsexist against men in those fieldsand essentially to treat them with disdain or to objectifydemumanize them in an explicitly nonsexual way.

1663280,0,t1_cjosxpa,You just dont get it.The effect of the greed and vindictiveness of Marsha Garces Williams ultimately proved too much for him to live with.He was living a shattered life with a cold new wife who didnt share a bedroom with him  facing an endless existence of having to fucking go back to work to pay huge alimony to an ex wife who abandoned him when he struggled with a relapse  living with the long established discovery that the salve of alcohol no longer brought him relief but was better than the misery of what he knew was upon him.These women knew the effect this shit had on him.  They didnt care.  They didnt worry that his issues could have these kinds of consequences.  It was only about them.  Not just that.  There was malice in their actions.If not murder then definitely they were complicit in his suicide.  They drove him to it.  A man can only take so much.When I heard Robin committed suicide I instinctively knew the daily grind of the pressure to meet his financial obligations  particularly the sizable alimony  was the primary reason for his suicide. Not just that but he had to continue to provide for his new wife who didnt even share a bed with him and be the patriarchal rock for his family.The struggles with substance abuse was definitely like throwing gas on a fire but the core of it is the difficulty of what he was facing.Could you imagine Robin Williams going broke? Or going to jail? A man so talented and beloved?He was  years old and had grown out the accomplished retirement beard. He was done. He had put in a lifetime worth of hard work. Now because of this latest round of alimony he had to get back on a professional schedule. He had to do TV. Make movies. He had to sell out for some paydays and get back into the grind. Hes  fucking years old. When was it going to end for this guy? He was looking at more years of work just to maintain the success he richly deserved in his life.You dont think being the source of someone elses perpetuity can grind a person down? I think it just wore him down and the booze had long ago stopped being a salve for his pain.This is what alimony does to men. Not only did the exwife get half of all he earned in  years but the divorce had forced him to go out and continue to provide for her  an already obviously wealthy woman from what had already been earned.Think about the current wife too... She didnt even see him in the morning. Sounds to me like they were living separate lives and she was just another vampire.Now imagine this on a smaller scale  when the man isnt rich like Williams. Such a fucking thing is a death sentence. This is why the suicide rate is high among divorced men. All this hate and vitriol coupled with double the financial burden. Mix that in with estrangement from children. Its a nightmare. All you hear about is the poor single moms.

I mean absolutely no offense towards people who have done nothing but reply to me in earnestIm sorry if I made you feel like I was insulting you personally. To your point its just an issue of a phenomenon I think permeates our culture. If you have a moment David Wong describes it more eloquently than me here in point  If you dont want to read basically its this theres this notion that men deserve the woman theyre attracted to after they do certain things or achieve certain goals. The womans take on the matter isnt important the man did the thing so the woman should love him! He did the thing!There are very few cases I can think of where an objectively attractive man marries an objectively unattractive woman. There are way more cases of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones than there are of.I cant honestly even think of an example at the moment. All this is to say that I think theres a different standard for men and women when theyre looking for partners. Yes women can marry rich and thats okay but usually its only if theyre young and pretty. I dont know if thats an issue about females in generalits an issue about pretty people. I think an insanely attractive man wouldnt actually have a hard time finding a rich wife. But because we dont in our biased minds immediately think about men in terms of their attractiveness we dont think about things that way. We do however find it really easy to imagine a hot young girl marrying a rich old guy and assume that women in general can do that when in reality its only a small percentage of women who have that ability.,MensRights,cjw9o8m,-4,t5_2qhk3
1722701,0,t1_cjwatob,Overall to clarify my point is that nobody deserves a partner for any reason other than the fact that theyre romantically compatible with that person. An unattractive unaccomplished  yearold man should reasonably expect to marry an unattractive unaccomplished yearold woman and she should expect the same. End of story youre right extremes can be put aside. I thought I was making my point clearer using those examples but I obviously was not. Just to get something out of the way I dont really know what you mean by its easier for a woman to marry richI dont know any particularly rich single men nor do I have the means or connections to meet any rich single men. How do I have it easier than you practically speaking?All I want to say here is that it seems to be a matter of pride in most of these situations. A yearold man certainly can live off his wifes income regardless of how attractive anyone is but many men in that situation would feel as if society would look down on them for doing so. That may be true but its an issue of saying I dont care to those who would look down on a man for being a stayathome dad or living off his wifes income. Theres no law saying a man cant live off his wifes money even if he married her when she was dirt poor she got some amazing job and he quit his to stay home with the kids. Point is many men seem against that idea for some reason. I dont really care if Ive been downvoted. It doesnt make me feel like my opinions are any more or less valuable.If youll look at other discussions Ive had with people on this thread Ive been open to their opinions when theyre open to mine. My conversation with jpflathead is probably a good example of that. Here youre shutting me down just as much as Im shutting you down. Lets not pretend that isnt the case. That being said I hear you on the standards of what is expected traditionally of a man in a marriage and in relationships. Heres the thing thoughwomen arent the ones imposing those standards on men usually. Theyre imposed by other men and men tend to care far more about the opinions of their male acquaintances than of their female acquaintances at least in my own experience.  Theres a reason a lot of progressive women want to go dutch on dates. It makes them feel equal to their partner. I think chivalry frankly which all this stems from is a form of perpetuating inequality. I dont really want guys to buy me drinks at bars to use another monetary exampleit makes me feel like I owe them something. I hate feeling that way it makes me uncomfortable. I dont want to feel that way. But men insist on doing so because why? People will call them cheap if they dont. Again its an issue of pride. And alright fair enough no Cracked. I just thought Wong phrased what I wanted to say more eloquentlyI too am obviously biased here. I can be biased and still curious about bias in the opposite direction.  ,MensRights,cjwb6y7,2,t5_2qhk3

1766256,0,t1_ck1sjis,ampampampSection . Death of article  Ray Chapman sfw gtgtAt the time of Chapmans death part of every pitchers job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns they smeared it with dirt licorice tobacco juice it was deliberately scuffed sandpapered scarred cut even spiked. The result was a misshapen earthcolored ball that traveled through the air erratically tended to soften in the later innings and as it came over the plate was very hard to see. gtThis practice is believed to have contributed to Chapmans death. He was struck with a pitch by Carl Mays on August   in a game against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds  Mays threw with a submarine delivery and it was the top of the fifth inning in the late afternoon. Eyewitnesses recounted that Chapman never moved out of the way of the pitch presumably unable to see the ball. Chapman didnt react at all said Rod Nelson of the Society of American Baseball Research. It was at twilight and it froze him.  The sound of the ball smashing into Chapmans skull was so loud that Mays thought it had hit the end of Chapmans bat so he fielded the ball and threw to first base.gtThe book Ray and Me by Dan Gutman says that after Mays threw the ball to first the fielders threw it around the diamond. Chapman then took three or four steps before he collapsed. Mike Sowells book The Pitch That Killed however states that first baseman Wally Pipp caught Mays throw to first and then realized something was very wrong. Chapman never took any steps but rather slowly collapsed to his knees and then the ground with blood pouring out of his left ear. The umpire quickly called for doctors in the stands to come to Chapmans aid. Eventually Chapman was able to stand and try to walk off the field but he could not speak when he tried to do so but only mumbled. As he was walking off the field his knees buckled and he had to be assisted the rest of the way. He was replaced by Harry Lunte for the rest of the game which the Indians won .  Chapman died  hours later in a New York City hospital at about  A.M. gtInteresting Carl Mays | Cleveland Indians |  World Series | Major League Baseball Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcksjmf oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecksjmf.

1781657,0,t1_ck3piyp,You are correct when you note that men have dominated at the top of society.  They also dominate at the bottom of society.  There are good reasons for this that have been written about quiet extensively so I wont go in to it much here but it is worth noting that variance and risk taking are major contributors to the dominance men show in many fields.  Having said that women were more prevalent in positions of power and influence across most societies than is widely believed today.If someone wants to argue that womens rights were restricted in a particular society I may well agree with them.  It is also often possible to point to mens rights being restricted too.  The claim of patriarchy being the systematic oppression of women as a class by men as a class is simplistic as even feminists are now increasingly admitting.As for voting rights for women. A lot is made of this.  The difference between full enfranchisement of men and women in the UK is clear cut  it was  years.  In the US it is less clear cut.  White men certainly had voting rights significantly before white women but black men gained de facto voting rights along with black women as a result of the civil rights movement.  So it wouldnt be out of order to say that full practical enfranchisement of men and women in the US didnt occur until the  s and some people say it still hasnt happened.Im disappointed to hear anyone say they dont need to go and expand their knowledge on a subject.

Now women are expected by feminists and feminism to be super women. This is creating a lot of anxiety. Of course a byproduct of this is that men are scapegoated by feminists for being unable to have it all because feminists never ask questions they dont want answers to namely men have never had it all.So on one hand you can see the disconnect with reality.

World War I of article  White feather sfw gtgtIn August  at the start of the First World War Admiral Charles Fitzgerald founded the Order of the White Feather with support from the prominent author Mrs Humphrey Ward The organization aimed to shame men into enlisting in the British Army by persuading women to present them with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform.  gtThis was joined by prominent feminists and suffragettes of the time such as Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel They in addition to handing out the feathers also lobbied to institute an involuntary draft of men including those who lacked votes due to being too young or not owning property.   gtThe campaign was very effective citation needed and spread throughout several other nations in the Empire so much so that it started to cause problems for the government when public servants came under pressure to enlist. This prompted the Home Secretary Reginald McKenna to issue employees in state industries with lapel badges reading King and Country to indicate that they too were serving the war effort. Likewise the Silver War Badge given to service personnel who had been honourably discharged due to wounds or sickness was first issued in September  to prevent veterans from being challenged for not wearing uniform. The poetry from the period indicates that the campaign was not popular amongst soldiers e.g. Wilfred Owen Dulce et Decorum Est citation needed  not least because soldiers who were home on leave could find themselves presented with the feathers.gtInteresting White Feathers | The White Feather | White Feather film Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckabtw oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckabtw.

1862106,0,t3_2fwzli,This analysis no doubt represents the very sexist state of affairs with the sexist judicial system.  But what it comes down to saying is women can hit men but men can never hit women back in self defence even as the woman is pummeling them in the face or they will be the ones arrested.  Weve seen that many times.Its not what the law says but its how the law is interpreted by these white knights that run it.Lets examine the analysis.gt Were I the prosecutor of such a case however I would argue very vigorously that the punch was in fact deadly force because the victim lost consciousness as a result. Remember in the context of selfdefense deadly force includes force causing grave bodily injury.  Unconsciousness qualifies as grave bodily injury.  Were I the defense Id counter that the unconsciousness resulted from the wifes head striking the handrail in the elevator to which the prosecutor me would argue that event occurred as a predictable consequence of the punchHere he argues that potentially causing unconsciousness by an unforseen consequence of being punched or hit is deadly force.  But if that is true then any woman shoving a man such that he might fall back and hit the hand rail in the elevator ought to also be considered using deadly force.Oh no because shes a woman!!So he argues as a White Knight that anything the man does because hes a man is deadly force potentially but the woman of course even doing the exact same thing with the same consequences to the victim is not using deadly force.Next he argues that a man cannot hit proportionally to a woman.gt any physical act of Riceseven a mere shove or smackcould well be several times as powerful as any similar act of his wifeBecause men cannot push or smack with less than their full strength.  You see that assumption there?  If a man hits a woman he must be using his full strength and because hes a man obviously he must be stronger and therefore its not proportionate.  Its all based on ridiculous White Knight bigotry trying to justify their code of never hit a woman.gt What actions on Rices part might have been proportional to his wifes supposed attack? Simply extending his arms and holding her at arms length would have been a prudent choice even if hed had to grip her firmly to keep her at a distance.  Alternatively he could simply have wrapped his arms around her to immobilize her armsa less prudent choice perhaps if she was angry enough to make use of her teeth or knees.To the White Knight there is nothing a man can do to defend himself except try and try and stop getting hit.  Pretty hard thing to try and do when someone is attacking you and he concedes that it probably wont work.  So in summary the man must simply accept being beaten by the woman or else he is the attacker.,MensRights,ckdku2t,3,t5_2qhk3

The if youre angry pause to consider why youre angry find healthier ways to express that anger approach. What else would you suggest when someone doesnt want to leave their partner but just wants the abuse to stop? In fact as I read it the advice simply works from the assumption that marriages and families are worth saving and that divorce is a very last option. It also suggests that if you want to encourage your partner that carrot works better than stick. Perhaps its an age thing but the working world of  years ago wasnt like sipping lattes on your beanbag at Google. I remember it. Even office work was grinding and repetitive.

They took place principally in the United States in the s in the academic and mainstream press. The scientific realists accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific objectivity the scientific method and scientific knowledge. Scientific realists such as Norman Levitt Paul R. Gross Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal argued that scientific knowledge is real and that postmodernists thought that it is not real. Postmodernists interpreted Thomas Kuhn ideas about scientific paradigms to mean that scientific theories are social constructs and philosophers like Paul Feyerabend argued that other nonrealist forms of knowledge production were better suited to serve personal and spiritual needs.gtInteresting Politicization of science | The Republican War on Science | List of works on intelligent design | Star Wars Science Adventures Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckmvno oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckmvno.

What he said from a PR perspective is very much questionable if hes also representing his company in some fashion while writing on Twitter. And even then some companies even assert that youre not supposed to post questionable things on private social media.Except it doesnt work either way. Try not having a facebook account or be part of social media and everyone looks at you like youre weird. Try to be part of social media and be honest and now you have to tiptoe even if its under a nickname. gtI condemn the persons responsible for bringing it up to his employer. But at the same time I wouldnt be able to reasonably defend what he said on any grounds other than those pertaining to Free Speech. What he said was pretty emotionally charged and brusque and I have my worries that it might have only been a matter of time for him before someone not affiliated with the Gamergate hooplah to notice and take offense. And that is what has me hesitant towards going fullstop in his corner.Which brings up the whole topic of NSA spying on everyone. Im sure every person in their day to day lives does says or looks at shit that would get them fired or ruin their lives if it got out in one way or another and you only have to fuck up once whenever that may be.

1975811,0,t1_ckqzufa,Many of the adults in adult prison do not have the intellectual acuity and maturity of an average adult. A friend of mine did a doctoral dissertation on a related subject which found that many were intellectually limited. Often they came from homes that were rife with abuse and neglect. Of those in the study most of the incarcerated had poorly developed social skills almost no ability to empathize and were on a rdth grade level in terms of reading and comprehension. Violent behavior is often a result of a poorly defined sense of self and a reaction to social circumstances. His suicide may have had very little to do with his surroundings  he could also have committed suicide in a juvenile facility as well. The idea that everyone should be in a juvenile institution may also be misguided. If you have a violent offender capable of causing bodily harm to other inmates then the population of juvenile offender who may be rehabilitated can be negatively impacted. An adult institution may be the most qualified institution to handle that type of individual. This should be decided on an ad hoc basis. I am not advocating one way or another. I am not familiar with this kid however I find both the argument that no child should be tried as an adult and every violent child should be tried as an adult are gross oversimplifications of a very bad situation.

2009055,0,t1_cktu7jc,I dont know any prominent feminists personally and I dont claim to but my experience in the real world which is more reliable than relatively anonymous comments on reddit or blogs that are designed with headlines and statements to get views and start a circle jerk with other similarly extrememinded people is that feminism is a positive movement in society that contains a portion of people who claim to be feminists yet actually do not hold feminist beliefs. As I am biased by my experiences with feminism academically and in normal social life you appear to be similarly biased by societal portrayals of feminists and some of the vocal bigots who love to stand on whatever podium they can find and spout their nonsense. The bad eggs are the ones who get press because the media always want a story. Most of the good eggs are not the people walking around topless at feminist rallies though there is nothing inherently wrong with that or even going to the rallies at all. Like most movements in the political sphere the feminists who are actually walking around trying to get attention for their beliefs whether they be good or bad are the extremists of the group while the majority go about their lives as normal and simply use their voting rights and the occasional speaking opportunity to further their beliefs in equality however they choose to define that term is up to them. There are several major rifts within feminism over the concept of what equal looks like between men and women. The major ones are basically what I would phrase as literal equality where women get the same pay are judged the same way in social situations such as when a woman has a one night stand vs. when a man has a one night stand women having equal representation in the political sphere etc. On the other hand there are those that define the standards for equal rights for men and women to be separate basically saying boys will be boys with their G.I. Joes and girls will be girls with their Barbies a point of view that Im not a huge fan of as it basically encourages many of the societally defined differences between men and women that already exist.,MensRights,ckvaebi,0,t5_2qhk3

It is a problem the test just misses what the problem actually is.And its not because of misandry at all its just that people are trying to be nice to women in particular. Theyre not trying to be assholes to men they just dont try to give an unfair advantage to men is all.Theres not some active campaign to try to beat the shit out of men in media there just isnt a campaign to stop it is all.But therein lies the problem  because the average person as a collective group tries to be nice to women it ends up hurting them indirectly in the long run.And yes the article is longwinded I try to keep them self contained. If you need to know C for B to make sense and B is required to support A then Ill branch off and cover both B and C rather than just assume everyone understands them. Unfortunately when you start getting into more advanced concepts be they literary in nature or otherwise you tend to run into things like that a lot. This tends to mean either you have multiple sections which are only tertiary in relevance or your argument is weak because it relies on a large amount of extra data thats not included.Most people fix this problem by citing sources that no one reads anyway. I just prefer to handle it by explaining the reasoning behind a source within the base article itself rather than pointing to twenty other sources that dont quite word it in the way thats necessary to understand the topic Im currently on.It just means it leads to longer articles which appear to be somewhat rambling but the purpose is essentially the same as listing off sources just without the need to leave the article is all.,MensRights,ckvmrz4,1,t5_2qhk3

Its incredible what can happen when the person you thought loved you starts trying to destroy your life.I remember sitting amongst like thirty other men watching man after man getting a permanent protective order issued to them. A few for the most ridiculous things. Made no sense. I had a lawyer though so I had a huge advantage. She had no proof of these wild threats I was supposedly making.  I still expected to get a permanent order against me. Especially after the first fifteen guys did. But no the judge dismissed everything.  It was so relieving. After two months Id get to see my son again. I thought Id get to go back into my home and see all my stuff again. I wouldnt have to live in my car.When the judge dismissed everything my ex wife was furious. The look of anger in her eyes... Who was that person?  The woman I slept next to for ten years and I had no idea who she was. That was the scariest thing.Want to know how to convert a radical feminist?  One of my ex wifes friends contacted me a month before this to warn me that my ex was bragging about how she was going to screw me over. She planned on getting me arrested. She already stole my identity and my credit took all our money all our and my stuff my child...  But she wasnt satisfied she wanted me in jail as well.She changed the locks on our home. My lawyer told me not to change them back or go into my house because it would look bad to a judge. But I still get to pay for half the house and half of her utilities. While various other men have lived there with my son. Its so great.And for what?  Because I discovered ten years of infidelity?This other woman the radical feminist if you Google her name youll get a bunch of pictures of her doing her crazy protests at the university of Toronto.  She talked to me every few days.  She had a front row seat to my male privilege.  Shes well aware of my MRA identification and no longer self identifies as a feminist. One down.Still after a year I see my son two days every two weeks. It was supposed to be over after mediation.  I was going to get my son half the time get my paycheck to spend on myself get my stuff back... I was going to get an apartment and move on. Get out of my parents house where I ended up moving back to. But no two days ago the ex refused to sign anything. Now that shes going to finally have to suffer a few consequences she cant handle that. She is refusing to cooperate anymore. So that means more court more lawyers more of this hell.But those two days every two weeks I get to have my son... I make sure those are the most awesome days imaginable.

For some this is a falseflag red herring argument. I liken it to people who argue things like how come there isnt a White Entertainment Television?  They lack the subtle understanding and nuance of historic systems of oppression. Similar to feminism besides the radical fringes Id say most MRAs fall somewhere in the middle.

And yes they value in how little the woman makes.My friend and the girl have the child basically    but the court just determined my friend would pay her support.. i dont know how it all works or why they decided that.. but it is bs.here she is barely working and my friend is busting his ass and has had steady work for the past  years while she hasnt and it is known and evident but the court tells him he has to pay. And the girl was demanding  of his income at first.. She didnt get it luckily..She is trying to take the kid away from the dad as much as she can because it means more money for her. But right now it sucks because he pays for the kid  of the time because he has him  of the time. Then he is paying for the kid on the mothers time. So he is supporting the kid  while the girl supports him ..The court can see she is underemployed but they dont give shit.. Im glad a woman is getting a taste of this for once..

Women are just more likely to abuse the law by a long shot because theyre trained to a victim mentality.Third do you really think that the law was passed because some woman somewhere was cackling and thinking ooh heres a good one we can totally screw men over IF... ...?No so much no.Assume for a moment that the people who pushed this bill into law really actually believed that young women are in danger.Such a person may be wellmeaning and otherwise rational and still support the bill... Not even thinking about the potential consequences because drumroll theyve ignored mens issues for so long that they dont believe a man could have legitimate issues at all.Or think about Bushs move on Iraq...

Well most of them.Youd have to understand the actual gender roles  men tend to be direct and do things themselves women tend to be indirect follow others. The feminist messages that appears to only be attacking men is actually exerting force on other women to act like feminists say women are like and experience. A feminist who goes around telling people that women cant say no to sex and that the man has to figure it out for her is not just attacking men from having sex shes also pressuring other women to act in that way by saying that this is how women are so the other women feel pressure to feel that way and act that way.Women also do not idealize women in the same way that men do. They know that other women are manipulative and often their real goal is to promote their own interests.When a feminists says women are scared to leave their house shes pressuring other women to cause them to feel scared to leave their house.When a feminist says women are victims shes pressuring other women to act and feel like victims.Etc.And other women are sick of being told how they should feel and act by the selfish damaged narcissists that create feminist articles. feminists have an inherent hatred of men but women do not and theyre also sick of being pressured to hold a grudge against men as a group because they like men as a group.,MensRights,cld1esv,3,t5_2qhk3

2161999,0,t1_cldby4h,gtYou believe that the standard by which we judge if a woman has been sexually assaulted is getting all these false positives. Women who werent really raped but say they are because if they feel bad after sex they are allowed to call that rape and ruin some innocent guys life. Yes?If they say they feel bad after sex of course they shouldnt be allowed to call that rape. Would you defend anyone saying they should?As obvious as I think this is you must definitely agree with this since you also just told me that men being forced to have sex shouldnt be classified as raped and date rape also shouldnt be considered rape either.gtSo if we apply that standard to men we cut through all our culturally ingrained sympathy towards women and see that feeling bad after sex is a terrible definition for rape or sexual assault or whatever.Feeling bad after sex is thankfully not yet the claimed definition of rape anywhere. I am talking about the statistics that lead to claims like  in  women will be raped and how they calculate this. The methodology used in those statistics isnt just including women who said they were raped since almost half of those considered to be raped dont consider themselves raped. These statistics were obtained from studies that operate on the basis that if someone  fits criteria set by the study then they were raped. So if sex when intoxicated is defined as that person being raped then if they answer in the affirmative to whether they had sex when they were intoxicated they will be put in the raped pile. The issue is that no matter how violent a man is forced to have sex with a woman it will never be called rape even if he is underage held and gun point and force fed enough viagra to erect a horse. The feminists whole agenda here involves saying that men are essentially all the rapists and women the victims. Therefore only men need to be taught what consent means and targeted as perpetrators and women need special protections because of how widespread and how at risk all women are everywhere from men.The statistics they use to support this are one sided because by definition it is unable to be anything else. If they were to apply their own definitions rules and logic to men and women then they would never be able to continue to keep this up. The CDC finding an equal number of men and women being forced to have sex in the previous year they studied and  of the perpetrators on men were women either means there is a problem with their methodology or they need to address all these  female rapists and address male victims of female sexual assault. Instead they just stick it in a different category and forget about it so feminists can keep happily quoting rape stats and conclude that these show women dont behave that way and how its such a travesty of injustice that so many women are victims. gtI did actually respond to this.

We dont see it as women oppressing men. There is no matriarchy or anything in the same way that there is no patriarchy. Its not about women having the upper hand over men its about men have specific issues that differ from what women face. For example child custody. Its not women that refuse to recognize fathers rights its society as a whole. A father doesnt have parenting rights because that is what the laws say. Mothers havent violently seized power over fathers. The state decides what rights to recognize. The issue isnt that women abuse their power but that the state doesnt give fathers an equal say in the first place. Our advocacy is to change this. Most people dont even realize that fatherhood confers no parenting rights. What else do we advocate for besides child custody?Personally child custody and domestic violence are my issues.

A man becomes a man by living up to the expectations placed on him. Men are expected to protect and provide for others and to not need others to protect or provide for them. To be a man is to meet that expectation.gt Theres a huge difference between arguing that negative traits are taught and reinforced to men and believing they are intrinsic.

Do they even have a concept of toxic femininity?gtMore strawmanning and some word fuckery. Anita never said toxic masculinity she said toxic ideas of manhood. How fucking obvious does it have to be made that the critique is of the social construct of gender not the act of having a penis? Later on in your post you even acknowledge it so why is the first half of your post written as though its not a cultural critique?I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have does not have it because he cannot have it. Hes just incapable of it. Barbara Jordan Former Congresswoman. We are as a sex infinitely superior to men.  Elizabeth Cady Stantongt Almost all of mainstream feminism is within throwin distance of this and increasingly so.Then all of mainstream feminism is increasingly detached from reality.The biological differences between men and women are clearly observable.gt All that your gender dysphoria proves is that sex does not determine which gender you are most comfortable with. It does nothing to prove that the gender you feel more comfortable expressing yourself as is a natural archetype and not a cultural construct. It proves that gender is largely innate and not a result of social conditioning. My social conditioning was the opposite of my gender identity. The fact that significant gender dyshoria is relatively rare indicates that most peoples innate gender identities are in alignment with the role they are assigned due to their biological sex.gt Oh were at  now?

It is definitely the dominant force in my gender identity.gtIn actual society however you receive a mix of influences and sometimes there are contradictions. You may have a set of natural preferences and your parents might have tried to squeeze you into one role but after exposure to other roles through media and social interaction you come to identify more with another. So we choose the identity which suits our nature? That contradicts your assertion that gender is social conditioning. Society provides a framework in which to express an identity but does not determine that identity.We dont brainwash boys into masculinity and we dont brainwash girls into femininity. Most are naturally inclined that way. Those who arent naturally inclined that way wont be altered. It will be painful for them but will not change who they are.gt Im completely fine with you believing this but youre making an error of assuming everyone else believes it.This is not a matter of opinion. gt You believe its biological and so toxic masculinity sounds like its an insult directed at you personally because to you masculinity is inherent to your natural state of being.No. masculinity is far from inherent to my natural state. I take it as an insult because feminists assume it is my nature whether innate or socially conditioned due to my physical sex. Look at NotAllMen. Feminists are quite prepared to judge people based on sex so long as that sex is male.I am told over and over again that I need to be taught not to rape that I feel entitled to a womans body that I am violent and controlling.Feminists wont let me disown the actions of men like Elliot Rodger. I will be judged by the actions of the worst people who happen to have been born with the same genitalia.gt To most feminists toxic masculinity is a cultural phenomenon.Yet they have great difficulty with the concept that not all men are like that. They treat it as innate until they are called on it.gt Its actually disappointing to see that you seem to grasp the cultural argument so why the fuck are you acting like thats not where most feminists are arguing from?Because their position is indistinguishable from one in which toxic masculinity in innate to maleness.Example Teach boys not to rape. implies that men have a natural inclination to rape.

It does not appear that the police are treating him as one. For instance the words domestic violence do not appear in the article and he is named whereas DV victims are usually unnamed.Boys and men who are victims of domestic and sexual violence should be aware that they have a fourteenth amendment civil right to equal access to services for victims and their civil rights are protected under the nondiscrimination clause of the  VAWA reauthorization. They should read the USDOJ VAWA Civil Rights FAQ and the reddit Mens Rights FAQ. They can also join us in fighting for equal access to the justice system for all victims by visiting our mractivism forum and responding to action opportunities.I urge domestic violence and law enforcement professionals to ensure that they are honoring their duties to uphold the law and protect all survivors and their families.

Fewer children are born. More family breakdown.  More mass shootings as men feel unable to get a fare deal from society.  Many men take the view they have nothing to lose by killing themselves and the family. They would lose them anyway.  problems with boys brought up without male role models as a father or teacher.Economically the West will lose out to the East which is happening now.  The problem is that feminism is not about equality.  It would be better if a new group was set up which ditched the female only mantra and included males.

2259330,0,t1_clqyo8b,Does a none sensitive skin graft influence an argument that you were making based upon prevalence of nerve endings? They dont grow back. Removal of the glans does not preclude ejaculation nor erectile functionality. Glansectomy is also common without grafting afterwards and the grafting process itself carries a high risk of failure. Give it a google most urology journals will have some material on the procedure. Sex is rarely affected. As for historical precedence I will go and fish out some books from the library in a couple of hours. Historically the treatment for a penile fistula for example was to cut the penis back to the point at which the urethra emerged from the shaft. It is pretty well documented until the development of more complex urology procedures to treat hypospadias namely to create a new meatus in the usual location on the glans head. Anyway there are many cases of these men fathering children which would imply that seeing as we are discounting the need for pleasure during sex which one can posit is a central tenant of intercourse their sexual ability was not hampered to the point of preventing them from engaging in coitus. ,MensRights,clqz31h,-1,t5_2qhk3
2261360,0,t1_clqq1tq,You keep claiming reductio ad absurdum as though it is a bad thing when in fact it is a valid method of proof. Reductio ad absurdum is about showing that an argument logically reduces to absurdity thereby discrediting the argument. Your argument was that it is acceptable to circumcise babies if it has the potential to at least slightly reduce the prevalence of HIV. Stated more broadly you believe it is acceptable to forcibly mutilate infants if it has the potential to slightly reduce incidence of disease. uelmariachi shows this line of reasoning leads to absurdity and is therefore invalid because when taken at logical extremes note the extremes are not meant to be equivalent to the original case otherwise it would not be a case of reductio ad absurdum it leads one to justify seemingly unacceptable procedures.Of course there are other means of attacking your argument  namely the initial premise itself. If circumcision really did serve to reduce the incidence of HIV then youd expect that countries with more circumcised men would have a lower incidence of HIV in comparison to countries with fewer circumcised men or at least that among populations of circumcised men the incidence of HIV would be lower. Since neither of these are universally true then even if circumcision does have the potential to reduce individual likelihood of infection clearly it does not work as a legitimate preventative procedure.,MensRights,clr83b0,2,t5_2qhk3

2269798,0,t1_cls45mg,gt But that doesnt scrub out those in your group that are like this.Every group has shitty people in it and thats just something the group has to deal with. There are Christian thieves and feminists who judge people based on their gender. The MRM isnt particularly flawed for having its share of dumb people too.There is also the fact that youve named your group in a terrible way. Feminism is about boosting women to men levels in the terms of rights. That is equality demanding no more or less than a man which I am sure you support right? But when you have a movement called Mens rights it doesnt come off as a equality movement despite even the best intentions.I think the name is perfectly fine. Feminism is about addressing womens issues and fixing ways in which women arent treated equally. The MRM is the same thing but for men. I dont see how you can criticize the mens group for using a male name while not criticizing the womens group for using feminism. Both groups names make it clear what theyre about.gt My suggestion if you really must refuse to call yourself a feminist because of a few radicals that get all the attention.There are quite a bit more than a few unfortunately.gt  Then consider renaming your group that involves both genders.I agree. I prefer egalitarian to the feminist or MRA labels which are so often misinterpreted. If you truly care about equality and not just fighting for one gender against the other gender then why be a part of a group that only helps one gender or the other?I know what youre thinking feminism helps men too feminism is for equality... but it really just isnt the truth. Feminism never fights for any mens issues. When it helps men its purely a side effect of another femalecentered goal. Feminists helped to fight against rape in the military and yes this was a great thing to help male rape victims and prevent future ones... but the feminists took action because there were female rape victims. Those are the only people they cared about helping... helping men was a happy accident.Have you seen feminism addressing the male homelessness problem? Or fighting to stop male genital mutilation? Or doing anything about the fact that young women are now  more likely than young men to become a college graduate? I never have. Feminism only cares about equality when it benefits women.And thats OK. Its fine for each gender to have their advocates just as theres a group for AfricanAmericans AsianAmericans and so on. It just gets stupid when feminists claim they speak for everybody and then call the other advocacy group a hate group or terrorists or some other nonsense.I refuse to call myself a feminist or an MRA not because of the radicals or idiots inside each group... but because the terms means something different to everyone and are so easily misunderstood.

2308609,0,t1_clx1sxa,There was pretty much nothing correct about what you said. That it has been men in leadership positions for eons does not mean that ALL men were on top or in control. It means that what we can call the Alpha males were they are quite willing to throw their fellow men under the bus. In addition alpha status is actually given to men by women as it denotes your usefulness to them. Similarly and related to the struggle for legal equality for women and womens suffrage the right to vote has for the most part been given to a select few men yes but only a select few. My point here is that men did not have universal suffrage either in fact the time in history where men had universal suffrage and women did not is like a grand total of  years probably. Men have a natural tendency to fairness wanting to play fair honor and whatnot. not all men have it but men have it more so than women. The unfairness women have lived under was always for their protection. It takes fewer men to reproduce the population after a plague or a war. But thats another point. You can clearly see this behavior when men have arguments friendships among men are easier to repair after there are falling outs.

It is almost never actually necessary for a man to hit a woman even for self defense because our upper body strength will usually allow us to detain them without actually striking them.  If they wont stop hitting you you just grab their arms and theres nothing they can do.  If they start kicking you then you maybe push them away.  Only in extremely rare cases and I mean extremely is a woman so aggressive that you have to actually hit them.That being said there are always extenuating circumstances.  Also I do think that any time theres a physical confrontation between a man and a woman people will make the man seem like the bad guy if he does anything more than cower in the corner and take the hits in which case hes ridiculed for being weak. ,MensRights,cm2f9kl,-2,t5_2qhk3

2365892,0,t1_cm43gl9,I think the Wikipedia definition of feminism is fine as a collection of movements and ideologies and I dont see those dictionaries contradict that either. A collection of being what Im trying to bring attention to here. There is no pure form and even if you would get a majority of feminists to agree on certain things those things would collectively be a whole lot more than a mere sentence.Feminism and ideologies in general are a whole lot more than just a simple concept. Anarchism doesnt begin and end with no government capitalism isnt simply he who owns most shit rules. Nihilism is also a lot more than just not believing in anything.What Im trying to say is that an ideology and adopting an ideology is not as simple as saying you agree with it even on central points. Its much more. For example the second definition of feminism in all those dictionary links organized activity in support of womens rights and interests Ive been to a feminist meeting and agreed with them on some things disagreed more does that make me a feminist now ?There is usually action accompanied by ideologies like gatherings to attend causes to fight for or teachingsknowledge to be gained distributed converts to get petitions and propaganda etc...You cant distill ideologies into simple sentences and stick them on people as you like it doesnt do the ideology or the person justice. In most ideologies you are expected to read and understand at least their most sacred texts. Once you have broad understanding of the ideology you may then distill it into as tiny a form as you like but if you dont know or understand how you ended up with this beautifully summarized gold nugget of purest whatever you dont know anything at all about the ideology behind it. How can you be an idealist if you have no idea why you should be one and how you should behave in accordance with your beliefs ? If I say I  firmly believe men and women should have equal rights and opportunities in society. And then dont do anything to accomplish that goal thats it am I a Feminist ? Feminism has no trademark on compassion. Maybe I arrived at this idea through Buddhist meditation. Maybe simply through embracing Communism or Anarchism. Maybe a little of everything. What am I then ?Sorry for rambling on I dont want to argue internet stranger but Ive been around for a while may have come across studied adopted and then rid myself of many different kinds of ideologies over the years.

2398766,0,t3_2mwdqc,Theres so many things that are clearly fucked up with how sexual assault is being treated on campus. First of all the words sexual assault are being tossed around like its no big deal. Anything from  touching a woman to a brutal and violent rape is considered sexual assault. Clearly that type of label on a man no matter what he did will destroy his hard earned reputation for now and for life because people will assume the worst whether he is guilty or not. However it is pretty obvious to me that many women are spinning regrettable drunken decisions into claims of sexual assault to shift accountability from themselves to men to protect their reputation. This creates a system in which claims of regrettable drunken decisions are inundating the the system designed to protect victims of ACTUAL sexual assault i.e. forcible rape etc.. If a woman was truly being sexual assaulted she would make every effort to put up a fight and then IMMEDIATELY go to the police instead of a bunch of campus administrators to protect her life.Now it is sad to see that when a woman cries rape more and more people dont believe her at first because so many other women have ruined and abused the system designed to protect actual victims. I can imagine it being a slap to the face when the woman who was brutally raped is reading how women in college having drunken regrettable sex in college are crying rape as well. Now the onus is on men to cough up thousands of dollars for attorneys to even have a reasonable shot of mounting a proper defense for college kangaroo courts where due process is thrown out the window. I know most men would love to protest this type of shit but are too scared of being labeled a rapeapologist by mainstream society.

2426714,0,t3_2n3t39,Interesting that the comments were closed before any were even made....But to continue. I have two small issues with this entire thing. First off I have to reference the Michael Jackson molestation allegations. Just before those came out with Jackson he had announced that he was preparing to purchase a controlling interest in Sony. Cosby had already tried unsuccessfully to do that with NBC and was preparing again to purchase a controlling interest in CBS.The second and more telling factor is the time period of some of the allegations. While it may have been possible for those incidents to have been covered up in the s there is no way that a African American man could have gotten away with raping a white woman in the s. While Cosby may have been one of the most important African American men in entertainment in the s in the s Cosby was just another funny Negro. In the s Cosby was doing standup and his first major break was I Spy with Robert Culp. He was nowhere as influential back then as he became after NBC decided to pick up the first ...Bill Cosby Show as he was the first African American to get a selfnamed primetime TV comedy show.National secrets dont get covered up that well not to mention a Negro raping a young White girl. If more than  people knew that Cosby was raping White girls in the s his career would have ended with him either in jail or at the end of a rope if not both. These allegations do not pass the smell test.,MensRights,cmbndki,1,t5_2qhk3

2442055,0,t1_cmdiiry,There was a reason for pointing that I out that I elaborated on in another comment. She specifically stated in the TRO that I have a history of mental illness which is not true at all. I neglected that in the first post but my point was that she actually does have a mental illness history and thats the root of her other problems. PTSD gt eating disorder gt debilitating stomach issues gt not taking care of our child. She uses that as the excuse for why she cant care for him and it was integral to the story. It also sheds light on the dynamic with her mother which is perhaps the biggest reason I need to have my son.My whole reasoning for not filing an order against her was because I want her to be an equal parent. My son needs his mother too. I havent invested ten years of my life in this relationship because I dont want her in mine or my sons life. The issue is that now its being forced into a situation of one or the other and her situation is extremely unhealthy. After all of this I still love her even though shes cheated on me at least twice but shes in no position to care for our son without me right now.Of course I wasnt writing coherently and was forming individual points. I was just trying to touch on the details needed to understand the situation and formed it with no structure. Ive already apologized for it twice. Thats why I elaborated further. Im not in a position to fix it right now but have tried to be more coherent and readable in my follow up comments. I havent really slept for  nights and its now nearly  am where I am.Edit The main point in mentioning the abuse is that her mother married her abuser after the fact while he was in prison for it. He was in and out of her mothers life since she was in high school and she repeatedly brought him back into her daughters lives after multiple episodes of physical abuse. Since before he was released from prison her mother has tried to force them to accept him back into their lives. She tells them that if they dont forgive him then they dont care about her happiness. Thats why my sons mother didnt talk to her for  years. The only reason she does now is because she supports her addiction and gives her money. I thought I made that clear but my whole post was pretty disjointed.Edit To further this and explain the attempted murder anecdote. The mother had broken up with and kicked out the abuser for sadistically torturing her daughters. I touched earlier on one of the methods but he would also do things like duct tape them in cardboard boxes to see if they could get out while he kicked the box around until they passed out. He showed up outside of their apartment around  am one morning with a  and a  guage and paced around the parking lot. Multiple people called the police but it took them a while to respond. He then went to what he thought was the mothers window but they had recently switched rooms with her and tapped on the window with the rifle until the three girls got up and looked out. As they pulled the blinds back to see what the tapping was he stepped back and fired a shot through the window that barely missed them and went through the wall into the mothers bedroom going through her headboard inches from her head. Just then the police showed up barricaded the complex and ordered him to drop the weapons. He walked out into the main drive through the apartments and raised both weapons towards the police trying to commit suicide by cop and was shot  times in the leg hip and shoulder. This whole incident was huge local news but linking archived stories would let on too much about their identities. During the police investigation following that incident the girls told about the abuse and he was charged with sexual abuse of a minor amongst other things. While he was in prison the guards put him in general population and let some gang members know what his crime was. They stabbed him in the face and neck from behind and he lost an eye. He later sued the Department of Corrections and was awarded somewhere upwards of a million dollars. Thats where he and the mom got the money to buy so many pills. This is the sick fuck her mother later married even after all  begged her not to. She later blamed the children for the abuse in court and parole hearings. She essentially groomed them for the abuse and repeatedly brought him back only for him to abuse them more knowing full well what was happening. This is the woman my son is with right now.,MensRights,cmdjjs1,0,t5_2qhk3

Because the more heroic or intelligent roles for men exist the fewer will exist for women since there are only a set number of roles available at any given time in all media.The only way to avoid this is for feminists to either stop attacking media creators over women characters not ever going to happen.Or for media creators to always produce stories with no or almost no flawed characters so men arent shunted to those roles by default also not ever going to happen because flawed characters are important for a story.,MensRights,cmmbkpn,6,t5_2qhk3

2608694,0,t1_cmyi5ma,gt Being born a man is playing the game on easy mode relative to playing it as a girl though.As I said feminism controls the narrative this is what we are taught. The sky is blue water is wet women are oppressed.Really If youre born healthy to educated parents in an affluent country youre on easy mode no matter what type of genitals you have.However if we want to hold the gender oppression Olympics men have a pretty good team. From a very early age toys and play are divided by gender. There are boys toys and there are girls toys. There are boys games and there are girls games. Girls toys and games are taboo for boys. Most parents will correct a boy if he tries to play like a girl. The opposite is not true. At worst a girl with be gently teased about being a tomboy if she plays like a boy. Oddly we keep hearing that the gender divide in toys is awful because it is oppressive ... to girls. One of the first things a boy learns is dont hit girls. Thats great except that dont hit other boys isnt a message conveyed anywhere near as vehemently. Girls do not receive similar lessons about hitting boys. This doublestandard is carried through to adulthood with constant media messages demanding an end not to violence in general but to violence against women. Violence against females is not acceptable violence against men is. When a boy gets to school he is met with a system engineered for girls and teachers who will grade and discipline him more harshly due to his gender. This results in boys lagging behind girls in education. In the few specific areas where boys are still doing better than girls mathematics and the physical sciences there is outrage resulting in massive spending and sweeping changes to correct this imbalance. There is no similar motivation to address the imbalance in girls favor across every other part of education. Boys grow up bombarded with messages about how awful men are. Men are stupid violent monsters who oppress and rape women. Negative generalizations about most other groups are not allowed but we are free to judge half of the population by the worst people who happen to be same gender.  As boys start to develop their own identity and find their own style they find that like toys there are boys clothes and girls clothes. Within boys clothes there is one maybe two acceptable styles for any given situation while there is much greater variation for girls. Once again girls styles are taboo for boys but boys styles are perfectly acceptable for girls. As their bodies develop into different shapes girls even have versions of boys clothes tailored to better suit their bodies. Becoming more aware of the world around him a young man starts paying attention to the news. He notices something strange. In a tragedy its female deaths which are emphasized. You hear that N people were killed M of them women. When the students in an allboys school are gunned down. They are reported as children not boys but when girls are killed they are reported as girls. In a story where boys are murdered and girls are kidnapped its the kidnapping which is focused on and the murders barely mentioned. It becomes very clear to this young man that his life matters less than a womans. If he lives in the US at  he must register for the draft similar systems exist in other countries. At any time following this his government can decide that his new role in life is cannon fodder. If he has any contact with the legal system he will find that it treats him much more harshly than a woman. He will receive a worse sentence for the same crime will be assumed to be the aggressor in a domestic violence situation and will find the family court biased in favor of women....and if he ever complains he will be told to man up. If he dares suggest that maybe women dont have it so bad by comparison he will be ridiculed called a misogynist and silenced any way possible.,MensRights,cmz3dwg,2,t5_2qhk3

2624537,0,t3_2pw3u3,There are still all boys schools in Ireland Ive been told by someone who lives there and boys do far better in those schools. And having all male teachers is also critical who will in fact teach to boys in their style which I am assuming is the case in these schools in Ireland. How to address the male child molester phony hysteria is not certain but one thing is certain it needs to addressed. Perhaps surveillance cameras in every classroom. Hopefully soon we will have advanced holographic technology where male teachers can appear to be in the room and that will solve the problem and not just for psychotic male hating parents but also take away all the fears for male teachers of living with the constant fear of a false accusation. Are you going to falsely accuse a holographic image of sexual assault? Good luck with that. What has happened to the educational system is horrifying and utterly evil with the non stop harassment and abuse of boys by the slobbering idiot female male hating hags from Hell along with their forced drugging of boys with drugs that are cocktails of amphetamines  Ritalin and Adderol. These women in the thousands shouldnt all just be fired they need to be in prison for life. Giving children drugs is a very serious offence that will put you away for decades.

Like I said I got a private message from a feminist explaining that there were feminist raids to downvote that post and yet it still got over  points. So if there is evidence that feminists are downvoting the post yet it still got over  points who is upvoting it? MRAs are and you should give MRAs a little more credit. I provided you with pretty good evidence that MRAs care about equality even if they disagree with you about how to achieve that equality.gt Men and women being hurt equally by gender roles does not mean that women and men are equal in every area.In which case it would be reasonable to have a MRM to worry about issues where men are hurt correct?gt This is a legitimate concern. But if youll notice a lot of the women being bad threads dont actually discuss sentencing inequalities and some are even posted before sentencing just so people can make wild predictions.Of course its a legitimate concern and its what us MRAs bring up. But then feminists try to vilify us for it. Why are you so against the MRM if you have agreed with so many concerns I have brought up as an MRA? Much of what you complain about are what you are asserting with no evidence in a way that does not consist of me and this is standard procedure of feminists trying to vilify MRAs. What kind of women being bad threads are you talking about?gt It may be unfair but not completely.If its unfair how is it not completely unfair?gt Men and women being hurt equally by gender roles does not mean that women and men are equal in every area.In my experiences its feminists that tend to see genders by their groups and MRAs that tend to see individual issues. Patriarchy is a great example of feminism overgeneralizing to create an issue that doesnt actually exist. Men dont actually get leadership because they are men. In fact our economy is largely meritbased which means that whoever has the best merits can get the job. Businesses hire whoever will make them the most money.gt My position is that the majority of goals the MRM has are noble but there are ways of accomplishing them without being so blatantly opposed to feministsI feel like you are blaming the MRAs for opposing feminism but you dont seem to be bringing up the issues feminism creates. Have you ever tried to defend men to mainstream feminists? They censor the heck out of anybody who disagrees with them or defends mens issues. When I called into a TV show I was treated like crap from the getgo for defending mens issues and I was banned on their blog for doing nothing more than raising mens rights issues with statistics and citations. What you dont admit is that many feminists consider the very talking about mens rights issues to be misogynistic. How are we supposed to communicate with people who think that way when they censor us at shut us out the second we speak our mind?gt Ive seen a number of comments denying statistics and arguing that rape isnt as serious a problem as it is made out to be. This should be irrelevant. Instead work on arguing against unfair standards of evidence and college policies.Rape makes up something like  of all violent crimes. When feminists argue that there is a rape culture it makes sense to put rape in perspective. Also when so much attention is dedicated to rape it comes at the opportunity cost of talking about other issues that are more prevalent.gt Again not talking about arguing for including forced to penetrate as rape. Thats a valid argument. Im glad you admit that. What you said is we attempt to debunk rape statistics. We mainly do that with statistics that ignore male victims. You agree with us so why tell us not to debunk the stats?gt Its the turning around and using this to argue that women who are raped is not a serious problem that I take issue with. Instead this should be used to argue that men being raped is also a serious problem.Again feminists argue there is a rape culture. That is what we are debunking because it leads to society looking at men like rapists and causes women worry much more than they should have to about being raped. Rape culture is the argument that is used for eroding due process so by debunking rape culture we are protecting the rights of the accused. We also directly state we are for the accused having due process. You try to separate these issues but they are heavily interrelated.gt No but many here are.Have you considered how antagonistic feminists are towards us and how many here are fighting against their voice being silenced by feminists?gt I dont have an explanation for this although Im sure it occurs.Well until you can come up with an explanation I think you should stop trying to silence from fighting against this very real issue of feminists trying to silence and vilify us MRAs. It seems you have conceded that feminists are the source of the problem and MRAs are reacting to protect our voice.gt Not mutually exclusive.Youre actually right in a sense. By MRAs raising awareness that feminists are excluding male rape victims from their stats we are raising awareness about rape. My problem comes in when you tell us not to debunk false rape stats because we dont need to in order to talk rape victims but in reality we do need to debunk those stats or males will be forgotten.gt Again I believe that most feminists would be more open to the MRMs suggestion of including male rape victims if it didnt so frequently come with the addendum that the presence of male victims makes female victims somehow less important. And if not then attacking that position is justified.Its nice that you believe that but why do you? Its feminists that have excluded males in an attempt to make females look like victims. In their eyes if there are male rape victims that dilutes the issue of rape of females. You dont seem to understand that most feminists see rape of females as the issue instead of just rape. We see rape as the issue and so we fight to include forgotten males. Why dont you tell feminists to stop excluding males? Wouldnt that solve both problems?gt if you discount extremists on both ends.You are falsely equating extremist MRAs to extremist feminists. Its like equating extremist Muslims to extremist Christians which ignores that there are more extremist Muslims. The extremist feminists hold the majority of the power which is why law after law aims to help women over bringing gender equality censorship is rampant on forums in games etc. Im perfectly willing as most MRAs are to agree with feminists fighting for true equality and Ive already shown that in our talks.gt Okay I suppose I was using the patriarchy mostly to mean social gender roles.Which is wrong because it blames men for social gender roles that negatively impact people which is inherently sexist. Id appreciate it if you stopped doing that.gt Thats because most men arent members of the MRM.And most women arent in the WRM. Whats your point? Also power is not simply a matter of numbers.gt Who cares? Again feminists and MRA should be fighting the same battle. Why? Weve established that feminism effectively means woman. Even equality definitions talk about equality for women which means inequalities of women will be prioritized over inequalities of men. If you want to see the sides working together then you need to talk to the feminists about opening up a space for men to honestly talk about problems without being called misogynists.gt So rather than blaming feminists for fighting for equality for the wrong reasons be glad theyre fighting for it to begin with and share your side of the story as well.I agree with them when they accidentally help males in order to help females but do you recognize that helping males intentionally is different than helping men by happenstance? Feminists will always prioritize inequalities against women over inequalities against men because thats what the term means so here we are prioritizing inequalities against men that are largely ignored.gt True but then they have to deal with unwanted advances.This is how you turn a privilege into an obligation. Guess what Ugly women dont have to deal with unwanted advances either. And no feminists are not fighting against men having to put themselves out there. Feminists do not fight for women to have to pay for half of the date.gt Rather than mocking and arguing against catcalling videosHow did I mock anything? The fact is that with any privilege comes detriments. Take patriarchy for instance. Lets assume it exists and men lead. Leading is seen as a privilege by feminists but you could say its an obligation to have to lead. Its an obligation to have money because people will ask you for some. You seem to have a double standard of turning female privileges into obligations and keeping male privileges as privileges.gt This only works because the men they are influencing are in power.Ive never heard of a powerless person that could influence someone else.gt Id have to say feminists have done tons more for mens rights than this movement hasOf course you would say that. Youre a feminist.gt Yeah I wasnt thinking about these I suppose largely because theres not much to be done about them.Exactly.

2731285,0,t1_cnehrv4,gt Boys are routinely kidnapped and forced to fight or act as support for fighters. The lose their childhood and miss out on education and forming relationships. If they survive it they often have seen the worst of humanity. And when they return home people tend not to trust them because they dont know what theyve done while away.This is true of course but it is also true that almost the entire world is against this happening. There are tons of organizations dedicated to helping prevent the use of child soldiers so its not as if society is ignoring this problem. Its just that with rogue terrorist groups like this there really isnt much that can be done from the outside. Sure it might be nice to see an activist movement like the bring back our girls to show that people really care but in reality this wont accomplish anything  it didnt for the schoolgirls after all.The bigger issue in my opinion is that for some reason Boko Haram taking a  year old away from his family and forcing him to fight for them is kidnapping and child cruelty but when any civilized government does the same thing with  year olds were just asking them to do their duty. Dont get me wrong Im glad that were horrified when people under  are abused like this but while were horrified at what these people are doing we should look at our own practices. Forcing our  year olds to go fight and die invading Vietnam isnt so different from Boko Haram forcing their  and  year olds to go fight and die invading villages.Increasing the age to  while I agree nice in that it gives people the chance to enjoy life a little longer before having it taken from them is more like addressing the symptom than the underlying problem. Rather than expand the definition of children to include more in the protected class realize that we should be protecting everyone.Using conflict as an excuse to abuse ANYONE is sickening. That said starting with children is a reasonable goal I suppose. Much more feasible to enforce and at the very least hopefully we can let every kid have a chance at a childhood.,MensRights,cnejajl,4,t5_2qhk3

2760196,0,t1_cnhrd6k,This is going to be my last reply because I am tired of repeating myself.  You do not understand innocent until proven guilty.  All that means in court is that the job of the prosecution is to prove guilt not for the defense to prove innocence.  Thats it.  It is perfectly possible to have a not guilty verdict and to be factually guilty.  The opposite is also possible.  What it absolutely does not mean is that a not guilty verdict is proof of factual innocence.  By definition it literally means guilt cannot be proven so you are not punished.gtwhich means you cant then tell someone that they cant call someone a false accuser because that person was not convicted of being a false accuserYou absolutely can but you should base it on the evidence of a false accusation and not the verdict of the rape case.gtWhat many do including you apparently is tell others they cant say someone is a false accuser because they werent tried and convicted for it but will also say you are okay doing it yourself if you have determined she is.I never once said this.  I said you cant call someone a false accuser simply because of a not guilty verdict.  You can totally call someone a false accuser and I will not protest if there is sufficient evidence to do so.  The important distinction is that they should not be legally a false accuser a punished without a separate trial to determine guilt.  They too are legally innocent until proven otherwise but you can personally think they are factually guilty if you want.gtIt does legally if we follow the logic of innocent until proven guilty. That is unless you apply it to both accuser and accused and we get a logical paradox with both parties being innocent at the same time.No it doesnt and there is there is no paradox because the trial does not prove innocence.  It simply determines if there is enough evidence to prove guilt.  It is entirely possible that there is not enough evidence on both sides to acquit both people and for both of those to be just rulings.  I havent even mentioned other legal technicalities that can lead to this.  She could honestly believe that that man raped her but be honestly mistaken in which case the accusation was incorrect but not criminally false.People like you are what give legitimacy to people who claim MRAs want to make it harder to report actual rapes.  They always think we want to prosecute any accuser where the case is thrown out or a not guilty verdict is given and apparently some of us do which i am ashamed to now realize.  Maybe I am the minority here but I only want to prosecute false accusations if there is evidence of a false accusation.  They are not the same situation and if you still think they are you either didnt read what I said or are you willfully wrong.,MensRights,cnhtnqb,1,t5_2qhk3

Men should be able to opt out of parenthood or get default custody of a child they produced if its being put up for adoption and they want the child. But only the person carrying the child should have a say in the abortion. The only way to change that is to change it under the law and then you immediately create all sorts of potential abuses.

I have a lot of female friends mostly through my girlfriend and work but this is one of only two girls like this that I know personally and it just kind of makes me wonder if this is a common behavior for people outside of the internet. Shes my best friends sister both of whom live at home with their mom still at  now that shes moved in again and I have heard her make arguments like this in person every single time Ive seen her. Ive seen her freak out so bad she screamed herself to tears over something slightly sexist one of her brothers coworkers said that was a fairly common and innocent sentiment..I dunno it just seems like severely uncommon behavior in the real world yet I see oodles and oodles of it online.

He will be because the proof is there that it decreases the risk of being infected with disease.

Thank you all for the debate but I feel that my efforts to understand why this thread is so anticircumcision have been not been fulfilled.

But if you came out with an actual law mandating that women register for selective service many would find a million and one reasons to oppose it.Thats why we need genderneutral laws ie Equal Rights Amendment that guarantee fairness for both genders. The simpler the better. Its the only way mens rights will ever be protected.

These conflicting findings indicate the need for further study to understand protective factors.Drawing on populationbased data obtained from students in th through th grades in British Columbia Poon and Saewyc  compared adolescents from rural and urban areas.

2913803,0,t3_2ticiz,gt  Why do you seem to spend do long bashing feminism? Feminism is currently the dominant narrative for understanding gender in America. It shapes perceptions on gender and drastically affects how problems get solved or if they get solved at all. The patriarchy paradigm which has always dominated feminism casts men as the privileged class suffering from sexism only when sexism against women backfires. From this view its nearly impossible to advocate for actual mens issues. Because of that we challenge it. Feminism is the hurdle in the way of solving mens problems. Moreover feminism suppresses male issues. From rd wave feminist leaders The Will to Change Men Masculinity and Lovegt The male bashing that was so intense when contemporary feminism first surfaced more than thirty years ago was in part the rageful coverup of the shame women felt not because men refused to share their power but because we could not seduce cajole or entice men to share their emotions to love us.gt By claiming that they wanted the power men had manhating feminists who were by no means the majority covertly proclaimed that they too wanted to be rewarded for being out of touch with their feelings for being unable to love. Men in patriarchal culture responded to feminist demand for greater equity in the work world and in the sexual world by making room by sharing the spheres of power. The place where most men refused to changebelieved themselves unable to changewas in their emotional lives. Not even for the love and respect of liberated women were men willing to come to the table of love as equal partners ready to share the feast.She goes on to talk about mens feelings and so on. It seems like a nice gesture but it really isnt. MRAs dont care about our feelings. We care about real quantifiable data. Being excluded from education discriminated against in court facing the lions share of violence paternity fraud and so on are real issues with nothing to do with feeling. Bell Hooks is trivializing drastic and brutal issues to the point where it looks like we have none when many MRAs believe men face every single one of the quantifiable gender issues.gt We are talking about the whole movement not the few extremists who ruin it for everyoneIts the extremists who get shit done. Where are the moderates marching against the AAUW and NOW decrying the academics and trying to change things? Nowhere. They sit around acting like yesmen for the extremists while doing nothing productive. They also give the extremists free PR. They are functionally necessary for the extremists and useless for MRAs. As Karen Straughan once said Not all feminists are like that but every feminist who matters is like that.gt  Why do you never talk about gay mens rights?I think that feminism only coops issues like intersectional ones because theyre out of real womens issues and need to stay relevant. The right answer here is that issues affecting all men who btw are not a privileged class are so prevalent and under discussed that we need to focus on them rather than the right to marry. The second part of the right answer is that we do fight for the rights of gay men since they are men. We fight for their right not to face so much violence to not be discriminated against in education and so on.Also this is on the front page right now.gt  Theres hardly any if any at all about transmen do you not support them?Of course there isgt  What do you support and what do you dismiss?We support real quantifiable dangerous problems. Common talking points are discrimination in education discrimination in family court in penal court rampant violence treatment of male DV victims who are btw the majority of DV victims and rape victims overimprisonment due to gender unjust marriage laws like alimony unjust child support laws the lack of awareness that male rape victims are at least as common as female ones the draft men being denied bodily autonomy as early as infanthood demonization of men in culture the overwhelming number of homeless males relative to female one and yet so few male shelters and more.Heres a good list of issues from our sidebar And heres a good compilation for DV Also check out rMRRef.

2989876,0,t3_2uepv5,I was never a feminist. But I was never antifeminist either. I think for me it started from realising around the age of  that this just doesnt feel right. Feminism was always something Id heard of something that sounded fairly reasonable if not a little bit selfaggrandising and I just figured it had nothing to do with me. Then I started asking questions about wider society and I kept being met by the same nonsense. Why are decidedly intolerant measures being justified in the name of equality? Why are women discriminated against when they are disproportionately represented in an industry like engineering but men arent when they are disproportionately represented in an industry like primary school teaching? Why is objectification only degrading and humiliating in one direction? Why does noone ever talk about the sheer volume of males I know to be homeless? Why do women get to slap me across the face without any societal ramifications yet in reverse its the most abhorrent thing that has ever happened? Why are men regularly paraded as bumbling idiots like Joey Tribbiani Phil Dunphy Homer Simpson etc. Is it really possible than  in  women are raped on University campuses? Why is male sexuality only view in a  negative fashion on the BBC? I mean all of these questions started reverberating around my head and then I started to approach feminists. The more I did the more I realised just how toxic the movement is. I have to admit I dont think feminism is alone in being the problem. I think culture is the problem  a lot of people on here seem to believe feminism is the only movement to reverse ageold prejudices male privilege espouse intolerant views under the guise of tolerance and ensure that double standards like sex while rape only flow in one direction...they arent. This is a symptom of leftwing politics as far as Im concerned. The same attitudes reverberate throughout society particularly in reference to how we treat minorities. For example theres a region in London called Tower Hamlets. The population is  Bangladeshi. Immigrant cultures congregate together socialise together and marry within many of them refuse to adopt the native tongue  people in London cant speak English white flight from London has been  in the last  years. Its tribal. Its human nature  they want to be around people like them. Yet when these views are expressed by the MAJORITY in mainstream discourse that they want to live alongside people like them they are deemed racist. The same attitudes extend across a very wide range of issues including the education system OFSTED inspections about schools being too white and the trojan horse scandal in the UK sexual violence public officials in a town in the UK Rotherham were too terrified to report on gangs of Pakistani men sexually molesting  white girls over a period of  years through fear it would be deemed racist violence against women campaigns which are notable because men according to the national crime statistics are twice as likely to be the victim of a violent crime our electoral system in the workplace our prison system our judiciary in the NHS apparently its progressive to hire foreign nurses at k per year while tens of thousands of British nurses arent able to work  it costs k to train a nurse. So we steal the best and brightest from foreign countries which are far poorer than our own and call it progressive. I mean the examples go on and on and I literally could be here all day but its this intolerance masquerading as tolerance crypticfascist nonsense that first drew my attention. These movements always use subjective outcomes too i.e. equality or assimilation or diversity knowing full well these are subjective terms which will never ever be realised. Hence they can continue peddling the narrative. For me feminism isnt the primary concern  the narrative the manufactured synthetic narrative about masculinity about social stigmas is. The word racism for example is used so often in the UK that it has lost all meaning  invariably the VAST majority of people who exploit social stigmas like racism feminism at its core is just the exploitation of male chivalry for their own political gain are white. Some people call this cultural Marxism I call it the narrative a means to control the population by either controlling the narratives which are permissible or displacing the population for one which better reflects the views of those in power as the Labour Party has tried to do largely by importing  million migrants in less than  years many of whom were from rural working class backgrounds who havent assimilated and who have in fact brought a great number of social cohesion issues to the UK and under the banner of progressivism. ,MensRights,co7wc9y,11,t5_2qhk3

After all if thats all it takes to get this kid suspended  times in  months it strikes me as miraculous that this school has any students at all since it seems likely theyd all have been suspended or expelled by now. It seems entirely possible that if this minor nonoffense is enough to get a kid suspended the schools in that county must be little more than cavernous halls where crickets chirp and teachers wile away their days sipping on coffee and rubbing their hands together deviously.EDIT  I love how Im getting voted down for pointing out what anybody with an ounce of reason should be able to figure out for themselves. You only got one side of the story. Why dont you rub the only two neurons you have together and wait until you get the other side ? Or will you tuck your tail between your legs and go mute the minute it turns out the kid is a little terror who was warned  times before to stop doing whatever he was doing before he was finally suspended ?Fuck is this an echo chamber or a place of reason ? For all you know the kid was pissing on his teachers desk while promising to banish all who oppose him to the netherworld using his magical ring. I dont know if some of you are aware of this but kids arent actually stupid. They know what their parents want to hear and they tell them that. In fact maybe the reason this kid was suspended has virtually nothing at all to do with a magical ring and everything to do with his taking a dump in the class pets fish tank. You dont know.

I am a feminist and an MRA am not hampered by any Protestant notions of sexual morality and have no quarrel with anybodys kink as long as they stay safe sane and consensual. The books are fucked up beyond mortal belief and I see why the BDSM community hates them but to my mind its porn and porn is a safe place to express twisted thoughts that you wouldnt really want to live out in reality. I think the books are pretty stupid but not evil. Its airplane reading. The movie isnt sanitized so much as it is something completely different. I really liked how they talked about Christian Greys victimization in adolescence as child molestation  because it was and it fucked him up and thats a message that I love to see put out there on the big screen to an audience of adult women. I also liked how Anastasia was willing to be emotionally accessible and willing to experiment with bondage but also willing to say no thats not my thing Im outta here. The biggest change from the book is that she ultimately doesnt sign a bondage contract because she doesnt want to be a submissive  and who can fucking blame her unless thats your kink it would be horrible!  ,MensRights,coljzbj,10,t5_2qhk3

Its also an open secret that affirmative action on race in many colleges amounts to a quota for various races.  And Title IX of course works as a quota on things like athletic participation nobody at Vox denigrates that theyre all about Title IX.Second is critical mass.  The Supreme Courts justification for affirmative action isnt the same as liberals.  Liberals lke affirmative action to right past wrongs and to balance discrimination against certain groups and the Supreme Court only allows it for diversity which critical mass is a part of.  The fact that its allowed under diversity doesnt mean the colleges themselves support it because of diversity.Furthermore if women are  of STEM majors  isnt that a critical mass too?  Or if women were  of college students generally?  Hell why isnt  of students being black a critical mass?

That is a compromise that creates as many problems as it solves without actually really respecting the fathers reproductive right.  The repercussions of bringing a child to life without the consent of the father extends far beyond financial obligation.   Without legal repercussions the best case scenario is that you convince a woman not to make the wrong decision. Worse case scenario youre left with a child with no father a father who still has to live with the his child being alive without supportand the guilt that comes with it and a mother who gets away with her negligence without consequence. By adding legal consequences to the situation you end up significantly increasing the odds of that best case scenario while simply granting justice to the father in the worse case scenariowith every other result being the same.gt not to remove the right of the woman to give birth if she so chooses.This is not removing a womans right to give birth. It is simply criminalizing it under the unethical circumstances. By your logic removing the financial obligation would be the exact same thing simply because the possibility of receiving no financial support from the father would be a deterrent to women choosing to go through with the unconsented pregnancy in the first placei.e. unwanted situation or repercussions leading to an abortion that wouldnt have happened under different circumstances. gtYour argument seems to be based on harm done to the unwanting father but I think your solution is backwards.How is that backwards? The right of sovereignty over ones body should extend to ones DNA and how it is used. The harm and injustice done to the father should not simply be dismissed like its nothing. Thats not right either. A woman giving birth to a child that wasnt fully hers in the first place is committing a criminal act against the father and in a way against the child as wellforcing a child to be born in negligent circumstances. A man forcing a woman to be a mother against her will is as much of a crime against her sovereignty over her body than a woman forcing a man to be a father or using his bodyDNA to bring a child to life.  The only thing that would be backwards would be to go back to completely dismissing the fathers reproductive rights in favour of the mothers whims. ,MensRights,cowwkyw,1,t5_2qhk3

3378318,0,t3_2ysu0k,Its definitely true that women are used to gentler treatment than men. For centuries weve been precious and protected while men have been expected to be aggressive. Im not here to say shes completely off base but I want to point out two things I think shes failed to acknowledge     The majority of harassment women who play video games experience is not in the form of trolling. I would say its probable that the majority isnt even consciously malicious.     If a team is playing with a mic and there are four whitesounding males and one femalesounding female and the other team has a troll on it you are lying to yourself if you say the troll is equally as likely to go after any one person on that team. Sexism doesnt cease to be sexism just because its easy.    I also feel like noting that shes implying that in order for everyone to be equal women need to be more like men aggressive resilient but men most certainly do not need to be more like women kind? I dont know. I see the opposite in a lot of feminist writings obviously. Its a definite trend for each side to claim the road to equality is for the other side to be more like them. I think thats something to keep in mind alwaysespecially when reading a piece that you would consider your side.   Also if I can rant for a second I am kind of sick of boys acting like gaming is their thing when I have been gaming since before they were a twinkle in their fathers ball and trying to quiz me to see if Im cool enough to enjoy their hobby. The author refers to gaming as a masculine environment and thats not a ridiculous thing to say at all because girls have been kind of cast aside as a profitable demographic since the early s but it does make me want to headbutt them. tangent    I agree with the rest of her points though there is something to be said about justifying sexist attitudes and behavior as if its just the way male spaces are. I understand the guy who has a chip on their shoulder when it comes to girl gamers but that doesnt excuse a poisonous attitude towards women. Also if I can go on a tangent again I have to be honest and say I really resent being stereotyped as soon as I use a mic because of my gender. Im an old married momI dont want attention or special treatment I just want to play a game without someone immediately responding with Ooo gamer girl and immediately trotting after me like a cat who just spotted a mouse.

It is however grossly misleading since cases brought to court long before this point were nonetheless successful in spite of the victim being married to the assailant.In the case in which it was criminalised which note is beyond the power of any court since that is a matter for the legislature Lord Keith of Kinkel said the followinggtThis is not the creation of a new offence it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it.He pointed out that for ages courts had been finding ways around this supposed exemption to the point where it was meaningless to assert that any sort of marital exemption existed. The last time it was used successfully was in . Now in fairness we dont know how many cases that should have been brought to trial werent because of a belief in the marital exemption idea.

3464428,0,t1_cpm935i,Thats not what I mean by a history lesson. What youve given me is a narrative. If you want me to believe that narrative actually reflects what really happened you need to give me sourcespreferably factual ones from third parties. Again I offer the alternative narrative that the recent growth of the MRM has more to do with Third Wave Feminism and recent feminist overreach on issues combined with new generations growing up in an era when women were nowhere near as heavily discriminated against as they were in the past. Now I cant offer you much evidence to support that narrativethis view is based on my subjective experience and while evidence to corroborate it might exist out there I must confess Im insufficiently motivated to look it up. Nor do I expect you to do so to support your narrative. But I concede that I have no hope of convincing you of mine if I cant marshall facts evidence etc. I just figured you might have some in support of yours so I asked. Based on what you wrote above though I suppose I wonder if you guys attempted to call attention to the fallacious arguments feminists were using at the time and their mocking behavior. That is to say not call feminists attention to it but that of people outside of the debate. I can see that not working because of a the spin feminists were putting on you and b societys unwillingness to criticize Feminism due to womens issues still being fairly large and unaddressed at the time but Im still interested to know if it was done and to what extent. For my own part the uptick in the MRM seems to be relatively recentwithin the last  years or soand seems much more likely to be a reaction to recent attempts by feminists to expand the criminal definition of rape to ludicrous proportions. They finally crossed the line and now people are willing to entertain the idea that they are bigoted and more about female supremacy than equal rights which has caused some of them to reconsider the older arguments actually listen and see that these recent oversteps are really the result of a preexisting pattern of bigotry. In my experience the vast majority of us are intellectually lazy and are unwilling to devote much timeeffort to considering evidence that falls below a certain threshold of obviousness. Once that threshold has been reached though we are given sufficient motivation to reconsider less obvious evidence and start to see the connecting patterns. This is simply a human faultwe are not as rational a species as we like to believe and mostly our decisions and views are governed by emotion rather than logic or evidence.I realize we may never agree on which of our narratives is more accurate. Im okay with that I hope you are too. I dont care enough to try to convince you of mine but if you want to convince me of yours I need sources.

The main excuse I hear from women and especially from womenonly subs is that Women are more naturally empathetic than men  there problem solved forever we need never speak of it again!I dont know where that myth came from but its the sort of gender stereotyping most women in those subs would grab their torches and pitchforks for...if it were inverted.Mostly its a convenient excuse Women are more empathetic  and understanding of someones TRUE feelings so they get to call out men on their bullshit  or better yet label mens complaints and problems as bullshit  because they can really tell what men are feeling. However since men arent empathetic they cant do the same to women  zing!Whether youre a people person or not isnt dependent on your gender. Its the sort of stereotype that was meant to have gone the way of the dinosaur...but hangs around because its convenient. It allows women to justify their criticism of others and attain a dominant social role.This is dangerous...because of course many times its evident that often a woman completely misunderstands men...but theyre given a free pass because of the stereotype women  automatically social experts and men  automatic social retards. gt I mean why is it normal and perfectly acceptable for someones girlfriend to be a neurotic bitch but not for someones boyfriend. Why do people think untreated personality disorders and shitty senses of entitlement are justified part of womanhood.Ive noticed its become trendy to start politicising how calling someone stupidcrazy is discriminatory ie offering criticism is discriminatory...as long as the criticism is directed towards woman. Ive seen a bunch of articles doing the rounds on social media along the lines of What men REALLY mean when they call females crazy.Granted if youre calling someone crazy that mightnt be the best way to go about delivering the criticism. But the point of all these trending articles isnt that crazy is a bad word its you should not criticise someone if theyre of a certain gender. Its its not that he disagrees with your actions and feels the need to point that out its actually because he hates you for having a vagina.Its a way of justifying bad behaviour.

I cant help feeling that the authors started out from an ideological position they were intent on justifying which I have never believed Murray Straus did.  On the contrary so far as I understand he had expected to confirm feminist thinking when he first started his investigations and was surprised by his findings.  Another point is the need for the authors to emphasise that the views they disagree with came second in time after the established feminist now mainstream ideas and are comparatively recent.  Since Straus has been publishing on this subject for decades and Erin Pizzey formed her ideas before feminists had taken over DV in the s I felt this to be dishonest.

I myself wanted to do something like this all in one day so that the attendees would not have to take off days from work or school or whatever during the other  days that AVFM is doing. I gave the  minute time limit as I felt that because the presentations are so long that it was one of the main reasons why there are less speakers for this year. I figured that we could forego the socializing between the speaking and save it for the breaks and lunch time but I take it that those social times are really important huh?I guess my motives are more to have a meeting of the minds and to use the conference as a weapon against the press that would be there rather than using the conference to socialize.

One can only conclude that youre in favor of bringing back one or more of the above travesties that weve as a society outlawed that you dont care about male children or that youre a hypocrite.So which is it should we allow parents to cut their female children too for religious  medical  social reasons is it not that its not wrong to cut boys but that you simply dont care about them or are you coming in here to preach to us about sanity and reason when you cant even hold a noncontradictory viewpoint on fundamental human rights in your own echochamber of a head?Dont ask us to be calm and agreeable dont accuse us of bizarre dualities dont concern troll the fuck out of us when youre the person coming into our stomping grounds to inform us that while youre willfully uniformed and nonchalant about one of our biggest issues we need to change to cater to your whimsy sensibilities.You wanna know how to tell the crazy MRAs from the sane MRAs? The crazy MRAs are the ones who arent yelling and screaming after such frequent exposure to meritorious occasions to yell and scream the ones who are disconnected enough to be all Yeah society embraces cutting up males and were a group advocating for males...

3698488,0,t1_cqdpf6d,gt ...dont you think that could cause some emotional distress?Sure but that doesnt make the actions of the person threatening to leave the relationship criminal in nature. Youre essentially arguing that freedom of association does not exist where sex is concerned. According to you people are free to not engage in sex but if someone requires sex in order to continue the relationship they must either end the relationship without explanation or explain their requirement and become a rapist if the other person consents.Heres a scenario for you. Jack has set a deadline in his mind that if sex is still off the table at the  month mark hes going to leave Jill. Jill learns of this from one of her friends that overheard Jack talking about it to a buddy of his. Without revealing her knowledge of Jacks requirement in order to continue in the relationship Jill has sex with Jack before the  month mark even though she didnt really want to. Is Jack a rapist? After all he had sex with a woman that according to you couldnt really consent. Does it make a difference that he couldnt tell whether Jill was actually consenting or just meeting his requirement? If it wasnt rape whats the difference between Jack telling Jill his requirement and Jill hearing it from her friend why would how Jill learned of it determine whether it was rape or not?gt Up until a point continually is what would make this harassment and borderline assault.As I said continually is too vague.

3758515,0,t1_cqk5ljx,Honestly i think thats fair. I know this is meant to be a sub about bashing feminist hypocrisy and im not joining in the circlejerk with this comment but I do think that if you ask a woman hey wanna come to dinner with me to this expensive restaurant expensive experience the onus is on you to pay. You dont know if she has the money for that. You could be asking out a waitress in a shitty restaurant or a check out girl. They probably dont have the money to pay  bucks for a night out nor would they agree to it if they had to pay. And you cant exactly negotiate a date before a date asking them about how nmuch theyre willing to pay etc is pretty weird and will make them see you as some form of tight wad. So if you ask them out to do something expensive that they wouldnt normally do be willing to part with the money for you should pay. this has nothing to do with gender if a woman did happen to ask you out to do something expensive rare but it must happen youd assume she pays. Now the question of why the onus lies upon men to initiate is a different question and I think we partly fucked it up by collectively seeing a woman who actively wants to ask a man out as a cock craving desperate slut when maybe she just likes you. Women do also naturally respond to dominant in charge men you can look at any thread asking women what they want in bed they want someone dominant in charge. Asking someone out shows youre confident you call the shots and are masculine all of which are very attractive qualities to women. This has nothing to do with cultural conditioning id say its evolutionary. If youre that guy who doesnt even have the balls the ask a woman out the womans gonna assume its because you know inside youre not good enough for her not on her level. So she wont choose you. Men compete women select that is the pretty much universal condition of every living species on earth. That is why we men have to ask them out its a sign of attractiveness of high value of confidence. Which turns women on. Thats not to say a woman cant or wont ask a man out it just explains why its less likely.There are gender differences and it is precisely these gender differences which leads to inequalities like the who pays on the first date who asks who out. ,MensRights,cqkp56h,-2,t5_2qhk3

3802383,0,t1_cqpnz38,gtWhat does represent feminism? Womens rights and empowerment?    Well this is the entire problem feminism isnt a simple ideological hierarchy. When people talk about feminism they mean academic feminism and their ideological views and differences prominent leaders and their differences activists college feminists TwitterTumblr feminists and SJWs as well as all the people that read a book or watched a documentary in college and read an article about it sometimes. Those are all feminists and thats a ridiculous amount of variety and differing opinions. Referring to feminism as ideologically consistent is absolutely absurd. If want to talk about a section of it than we can start to talk much more specifically Twitter feminists have a pretty strong stereotype and I would wager that the majority of them dont differ much. So this broad sweeping statement of all these people with varying commitment levels and varying ideals as feminism is wildly inaccurate. Here in the SF Bay Area feminism is really big and I meet a lot of people who arent activists but identify as feminists and they disagree with a lot of what this movement thinks feminism is. For the most part theyre more Christina Hoff Sommers than they are Jessica Valenti. And thats feminism too.     Now if you want to talk about radical feminism and how that has become the majority among influential feminists and academics than we can talk about that. But the majority of one subset of feminism is not feminism.    gtThen how come they arent universally on board with say legalizing prostitution and making sex work safe for all women? In fact some are totally against all sex work for women and argue that that theyre pretty much all being trafficked or forced into somehow and its something no women should be doing. So how does that fit with the idea that women should be able to do what they want? It doesnt but it makes sense if you understand that their motivation is keep men from easily getting what they want.    I disagree with your assertion that sex negative feminists being opposed to prostitution is to hurt men. They sincerely believe that so many women are exploited through sex work that sex work isnt worth having. Outside of the women who are truly coerced into sex work they believe that many women are socially pressured into it and that they know whats best for these women more than the women do themselves. Which is enormously elitist and offensive and why sex negative feminists get yelled at a lot by sex positive feminists. Nearly all young feminists are sex positive and my understanding is that this view held by the majority of feminism.   gtThey may be able accept women choosing to become sex workers but they still look down on the men who use those services.    But is that because they are feminists or because of the culture they are in?  This article states gtAnother necessary condition for sex work to be made beneficial to women is to destigmatize the role of the sex worker in society. Currently sex workers are viewed as immoral worthless people by most of society. Sex is a taboo topic in society and women especially are not supposed to be sexually assertive. In order for sex work to be treated as a legitimate form of work society needs to step away from our Puritan views on sexuality and human nature. When it is accepted in society that human beings are sexual and when we are allowed to express and explore our sexuality and sexual desires sex work will begin to be treated with respect in society.    More explicitly this article is all for men patronizing prostitutes. Thats Salon dude. Im not going to say this isnt a controversial topic but theres plenty of feminists who would argue that men should have no shame for seeing a prostitute and that feminism is fighting to end such stigma.    gtWell youve probably seen lists of hateful quotes from popular feminists before but since youre asking this you have probably dismissed them so my question is why?    Many have significant problems theyre out of context and often outright deceitful or made by someone that is considered crazy and not representative of feminism. The valid ones? Yeah that bothers me a lot. It also bothers me a lot that feminism has this attitude of not bothering to engage them since they think it should be obvious to an outsider that these people are fringe. And this is exactly the point of course theres misandrists in feminism. Misandrists are going to flock to the movement. Being able to point to one is completely meaningless. Being able to point to one in power is better but it still doesnt show that the view is representative of feminism. A minority of people stating explicitly hateful things who all fall under one sub movement of feminism does not convince me that we have a systemic problem.      gtName someone who you think is and Id bet I could find something hateful from them too.    Beats the hell out of me. I mean who could possibly be representative of all the camps of feminism? I also hang out in my own little camp most of the time so Im not going to be familiar much with radical feminism or what have you.     gtThis shit is even in the sidebar. Cmon    Thats my bad. Ill do some reading.     gtHow do you think they ended up in power if they had little to no support like I figure youd argue?    Well theyve got quite a bit of support or at least people who dont care much about the policies in the upper echelons of feminism. Which sucks big time. So is the majority of academic feminism this way? Yes. Can we call that feminism? No. ,MensRights,cqppa09,0,t5_2qhk3

I dont think paid maternity leave hurts men at all and it probably helps married men.again with the gender wage gap myth.  very misleading to not state the gap is across all professions that women choose jobs that pay less but they find more satisfying while men choose jobs that arent as satisfying but pay more that men work longer hours etc.women in congress hold  of the seats in congress... men to every one women on the board of fortune  companies....this is a combination of the apex fallacy and selection bias.  the apex fallacy only looks at the top of society rather than society as a whole.  there may be more men than women in congress but men also make up the vast majority of the homeless the incarcerated etc.  there is no desire by women to make things equal in those fields.  its also the same in careers that are majority women.  women arent pushing for equality for men in school teaching jobs or nursing for example.  as for selection bias members of Congress are voted for by the public and the majority of voters are women.  if women really want an equal number of women leaders they could make this happen at the next election.  its the same with board members of companies who are selected by the share holders of those companies.  so arguing that there is gender inequality in america because there arent enough women in leadership positions is not correct.  women can run for office and vote for women leaders if they want to.  they just dont.quotas for corporate board seats are a bad idea.  you then have a law that says you must put less qualified people on a board that the companys shareholders didnt vote for.  ,MensRights,cr0fkk8,2,t5_2qhk3
3897269,0,t3_3525kw,Something very similar happened to my fianc at the time.  It was in Las Vegas and she was living with her mother disabled sister and  year old daughter. I was in the military and lived in California. I would drive to see them on the weekends. Anyway they were all eating dinner when a spotlight lit up the balcony of the apartment they lived in the second floor. A minute or so passed and my fianc decided to peek her head her head out the front door to see what was going on. They did not live in a very good areas of Vegas and police presence was not uncommon. So she opens the door and peeks down the steps. There are  officers with guns drawn screaming at her to get her hands up and countless others behind them. She raises her hands and steps out of the doorway. The cops rush the apartment scaring the living shit out of my MIL SIL and daughter. They go through every door and closet they can find flip mattresses to check under the beds. After the search was over they explained what was happening. Someone called the cops giving the exact apartment number and descriptions of my wife and MIL saying that I at this time on base in Cali had a shotgun and was holding them hostage and threatening to kill them. My wife explained that I wasnt there nor have I ever been violent with anyone in the house. After a while the cops apologized and left. We still dont know who called or why. I was there the next weekend and the cops didnt break the door down to get me. Im not sure if I should be mad that they stormed the place scaring everyone without any evidence or glad that if something was actually happening they would have gotten the situation under control in record time. I have no advice for OP. Im pretty sure if I had been there at the time I could easily have been arrested or quite possibly shot. ,MensRights,cr0itsb,7,t5_2qhk3

3902593,0,t1_cr14fj4,Which is why even though it uses an image of a battered man the message of the poster highlights female abusers. It does so in a more subtle way than you seem to be asking for though. I agree with you that trying to evoke sympathy for men is an uphill battle in our culture but I think a more direct attack on female abusers say with an image of an angry woman or something would also be challenging since women are a class that society isnt exactly conditioned to feel antipathy towards.I think Ive managed to split the difference here.EDIT To get a little more indepth on this point I want you to consider the visual language of this poster. While no female abuser is explicitly depicted she is depicted symbolically through the composition The mans bruised and bloodied face is obscured by a familiar triumphalist girlpower slogan rendered in bold red letters that almost seem like they could have delivered the assault themselves. The man though battered carries a stoic expression on his face in stark contrast to the faces of fear and sadness worn by women in typical antiDV campaigns. Though his face is mostly covered up symbolizing the sweeping of male victims under the carpet his eyes peer through at the viewer making direct eye contact that challenges them to reexamine their assumptions.,MensRights,cr14ozf,6,t5_2qhk3

My blog addresses the same kinds of concerns about the hostility to due process that the Harvard and Penn law professors almost all of the them liberal expressed in the article cited in my postonly they do it much more forcefully than I do. My posts appear on this subreddit because some people here are interested in these issues.Second I have no idea about preaching to the choir but anyone who believes that the adversarial system is fucked ought not to be writing about thorny issues involving the adjudication of alleged sex offenses because he or she has a puerile and woefully unschooled take on the issue.Third your final sentence manifests your regrettable but predictable bias.

Whether or not Johnson is a rapist I dont know and neither do you and neither does your mountain climberersatz legal expert. I do know that one alternate juror said this The lack of evidence was troubling. The alleged victims mixed messages and comments to friends cast doubt on allegations. The alleged victim even questioned events of the evening and there was no evidence that Jordan Johnson knew that he had sex without consent. Its the rushtojudgment crowd you included that is giving so many avowed liberals who teach law such heartburn.

3908041,0,t1_cr0snmx,I am going to criticize you here rather significantly so I would like to first say two things.  Tone is very hard to convey online so I want to assure you I am being highly respectful.  If I didnt value you as a member of the community and have concern for you than I would ignore you and not take this not insignificant amount of time out of my day to make this comment.     gt Untrue. The aggressive groups were the movement.You have provided no evidence that this is the case.  What of this It certainly seems that political campaigning was the majority of the movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton seems to be one of the most prominent and important sufragettes in the US and Susan B Anthony another and I find no evidence of either of them or their organizations engaging in such terrorism.    gtIf you think its not representative then youre either dishonestor using some new and interesting form of the english language of which I am currently unaware.    That you think that you have presented enough evidence to compellingly argue your case is absolutely terrifying. Further that you think that my skepticism is unwarranted is beyond terrifying. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and when one is not knowledgeable about a subject and has only heard one position on it than being agnostic towards that position is the only logical thing to do. Further the Womens Social and Political Union article you linked me to stated The Womens Social and Political Union WSPU was the leading militant organisation campaigning for Womens suffrage in Great Britain which rather strongly implies that there are other nonmilitant organizations.       You are asking me to trust your knowledge and abandon my agnostic position of skepticism despite the fact that what you have presented me with suggests that you may be wrong.    gtAgainblatantly false.    You did not present me with the extraordinary evidence required to compel any reasonable person to adopt your position and that you think you have accomplished this is absurd. You have pointed to some violent people and an organization which in their very descriptions separate them from the mainstream movement and have provided no evidence or reasoning as to why they are representative of the worldwide movement as a whole.  Even if the movement in Britain at that time were predominately violent for which you have established reasonable plausibility that in no way argues for all movements in all countries at all times.  gtI produced a scholarly work    About the movement in one country at one point in time.    gtNot to mention what I said is common knowledge that anyone could find in a ten second google search.    And what of the fact that I can also easily find evidence of large early womens movements that were peaceful?   gtSo noyoure as wrong as you were when you tried to make that ad hominem comment above to give yourself an excuse to reject the claim and evidence.    That was not ad hominem. I would not trust Gandhi on race relations as he was racist. Is this ad hominem? No. Similarly I will not listen to sexists on the issues of sex relations. I hold that women deserve an equal opportunity to vote and hold positions of political and business power. Anyone who disagrees with me on that will get no consideration from me regarding this specific issue. If a slave were proslavery would you thoughtfully consider their argument or would you discredit any argument they had to make on the grounds that you believe slavery to be absolutely immoral?    And again this is said with much respect and is indeed the only thing I can say if treat you with respect If the errors you have made here that led you to believe that you compellingly argued your case are not highly abnormal for you than you should seriously look at the way in which you examine reality. That you think I am being unreasonable for not adopting your position should be enormously alarming to you as should be your hostility towards my skepticism.

In this case you accuse him of being a misogynist who doesnt see women as human and a psycho.Does that sound familiar at all?It should. Because those are exactly the weapons that feminists have chosen against rmensrights. Which supports what he said in a deliberately inflammatory style right up front You are imitating the feminist movement even as you think you oppose it. Your opposition takes the same form as the feminist movement you see. It is a public appeal for understanding and fairness. Unconsciously rMensRights is aping the feminist movement because it desires the same sort of results women got sympathy and support and a dismantling of their roles and responsibilities. You dream of women feeling your feel. You collectively believe that if only you can be persuasive enough you will gain sympathy. The whole reason that rMensRights feels a need to exist in the first place is because feminists fucked things up but you are proceeding forward using their exact strategy.

In fact I dont need to foresee it because its the present. And what has been pointed out to you which so far you have missed is that the fact that you are engaging in this particular kind of contest is a result of a deep emasculation of the soul selfinflicted upon our culture by the men of previous generations who gave in to feminism.

3937333,0,t1_cr5299v,gtI would love to see some data on this.My pleasure.  There have been plenty of studies of this going back decades.  Probably the best and most readerfriendly one is by former guncontrol advocate Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago  More Guns Less Crime  Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws is a good place to go.This is from a review of the latest edition of the bookgtOn its initial publication in  John R. Lotts More Guns Less Crime drew both lavish praise and heated criticism. More than a decade later it continues to play a key role in ongoing arguments over guncontrol laws despite all the attacks by guncontrol advocates no one has ever been able to refute Lotts simple startling conclusion that more guns mean less crime. Relying on the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever conducted on crime statistics and righttocarry laws the book directly challenges common perceptions about the relationship of guns crime and violence. For this third edition Lott draws on an additional ten years of dataincluding provocative analysis of the effects of gun bans in Chicago and Washington D.Cthat brings the book fully up to date and further bolsters its central contention.In the past couple of decades multiple US states and municipalities removed or reduced restrictions on citizens carrying concealed weapons something I do all the time  in fact I just came back from walking around my neighborhood and Im carrying a pistol as I type this.  Every time those laws were proposed people trotted out the same arguments about how they were going to see a bloodbath as simple disputes turned into shootouts.  In every single case they were wrong the presence of concealed weapons means that criminals face the very real possibility of facing armed resistance.  Bad shoots by CCW holders are virtually unknown unlike the police.  If memory serves somewhere around  of residents in shallissue states get the permits.  To a criminal that means that one victim out of  on average may be carrying a pistol that heshe wont know about until the crime is in progress and that extends to bystanders as well making it virtually inevitable that violent criminals will find themselves looking down the barrel of a gun on a fairly regular basis  and it only takes one bullet to kill or maim you.  Its no surprise that many of them find better things to do with their time  and violent crime drops as a result.  The stats are in  gun control kills which is one major reason why the highestcrime areas also tend to have the strictest gun control laws.This link is a transcript of an interview with Prof Lott that lays out the basics of his findings in a few paragraphs.Edited to fix a format error.,MensRights,cr539pe,1,t5_2qhk3

3993359,0,t3_366jbv,It is simply because women are considered intrinsically valuable while men are only valued for what they do. A woman who makes nothing of herself is perceived as nowhere near as pathetic and repugnant as a man who makes nothing of himself. A woman who makes nontraditional choices is still a woman because there are no specific expectations or requirements in order for a woman to be considered to have value. A man who makes nontraditional choices on the other hand is seen as not fulfilling his societal expectations. He is living selfishly in other words and selfishness is only allowable for women. Women want men to work for them and men who feel that their role is to provide for society tend to also feel that other men should do the same and expect them to play for the same team so to speak. Men who believe that a man should provide will often feel the same way about gay men as they do about men who never move out of their mothers house or men who stay at home with the kids while the woman goes to work.

Other than that though I agree with you.Also to op its okay to be scared but within a reasonable margin. Its not the end of the world theres still opportunity and tools for justice and as a society we are still evolving. Awareness is the first step to addressing a problem. The coming to solutions might be slow but were getting there. And as a community we are growing. If anything any inequality expanding will have more people wake up and take discrimination against men seriously they wont be able to believably deny something so obvious.However only acknowledging selectively negative events will not bode well for your mental health which you should take care of before you try to take on society. While its important to be knowledgeable about these things its also good to remember you are getting a concentrated overexposure of news that seems to be every man or the norm. Not to diminish how tragic these different cases are and how we need to prevent them but they still arent happening even half of the time. While its okay to worry and be wary its also good to breathe. Take a break from this sub if necessary you cant keep up retaining a stream of upsetting information without it stressing you out.

Even though the courts fuck it up and hand out pathetically low sentences thats an argument for educating the public lawyers and judges better and at the very most IMO minimum sentencing laws maybe some other things but basically justice system reform and public information campaigns. We might have a large spread of ideas on what reforms how far reforms should go etc but I think were all on the same track there.Not an argument for Oh noes teh innocent until proven guilty is hurting mah feelz. Misandry! When a man accuses a woman of rape we should fire her or kick her out of college immediately and nationally shame her in the media. In fact if a man doesnt come out and expressly publically say that sex was consensual we need to assume it was rape because of male shame in admitting it. This is all a civil action innocent until proven guilty is a criminal one so its ok.If you fail to adhere to these demands tho well make sure the government pulls funding from your university. Or boycott your company and make a media shitstorm about it using our institutionalized power in the media.No we dont want to consider the implications of us being able to leverage enough social power to get what we want in these kinds of issues it might upset the narrative and our feelings.I guess that bit about institutional power doesnt apply for us though.What this ACTUALLY is is a demand for women to be able to persecute men on campus and to create a hostile atmosphere for men despite them already being a minority.Its not about punishing rapists because they are pretty damn adamant that the justice system not get involved and seem nonchalant about the fact that their system dramatically raises the chances of innocent men being punished and having their lives ruined.And if it IS about punishing rapists and theyve decided innocent until proven guilty needs to be thrown out then they are still pretty fucking crazy and authoritarian.Personally im betting its a mix of idiots spiteful bigots and the naive who havnt considered the implications of the feminist position coupled with selfserving politicians who know that the feminist media can drive the womens vote.,MensRights,crdahc9,6,t5_2qhk3

The taxpayers are supporting their children.  The mothers and children get the same amount of welfare food stamps low income housing medical coverage etc whether the fathers pay support or not.  So unless we are willing to let children starve in the streets the only effect of eliminating child support would be encouraging even more reproduction by irresponsible fathers.  The threat of child support at least theoretically gives them an incentive to not have more children they cant afford.  gtChild support has accomplished its goal of holding men accountable.Why in Gods name would we not want men to be accountable for supporting their own children?  How is a free pass to propagate indiscriminately ever going to be in the best interest of society?  gtAbolishing the child support program will make women more accountable for who they chose to have kids from.How so?  If you cant collect child support from a poor man and you cant collect child support from a rich man then why be all that concerned about the difference?  At least now women have an incentive to pick men capable of providing for children.  You are hoping for some mythical la la land where fathers only have to support children if they want to.  Well lets face it if fathers all wanted to support their children voluntarily then we wouldnt be discussing child support at all now would we?  It is an indisputable fact that for many generations large numbers of fathers have been willing to abandon their children.  Telling women to make better choices is not going to magically change that.  Telling fathers that they have a free pass to propagate is not going to make them more responsible.  Obviously.  gtThat would in turn slow the rate in which women terminate marriages or cohabitation with the father in the first place.Has it occurred to you that the reality of paying child support slows the rate in which men terminate marriages or cohabitation with the mother?  That it gives them an incentive to be a better partner?  That it makes them less desirable for a new relationship?  All of which is good for family stability.gtThe mother would know it would be difficult to find another man who would willingly support her kids from another man.So you are actively advocating that women should be financially forced to remain in marriages with some asshole dickwad loser who would abandon his own children to starve if she left him?  What would you like to call this?  How about the I Only Support My Kids If I Get Pussy Whether She Wants It Or Not program?  Wow thats prime fatherhood material.

France but a lot of this . is Muslim women having children.The fall in fertility is directly related to feminism and the changing gender roles. Females were given benefits and were allowed to continue with there old gender role or take on a new gender role that of a male in society.  This has been given to them without them taking on equal responsibility.At the same time as the female role  was changing no attempt or help has been given to men to change there skill set or give them more rights over children or family. Male unemployment is much higher than female unemployment. We all know the difference in health spending education attainment etc.Huge numbers of men are in prison.  Locking men in prison and forcing them to work as slaves is big business.The Corrections Corporation of America is the largest private prison company in the US.There is money in Democracy and politicians say and do things to get elected.Going down the current path is a vote winner and so no chance of any change soon.

Feminism is about redistributing wealth and power such that it all flows to the feminists themselves.gt also her concert stage example is complete bullshit there is no enforced rule that men are at the front they are either their on merit paid for it or through choice any woman can go to the front by the same rule nothing prevents them based on their genderThe front and the back of the concert hall is in reference to a recent Muslim gathering in which the men were asked to sit at the front and the women asked to sit at the back.But moreover there is a big logical fallacy in her argument. She assumes that just like a concert or movie you can sit at the front one day at the back another day and that you get to swap around a lot i.e. there are lots of opportunities to visit the theater and sit down so everyone gets a good view sometimes. In the theater of life thats just plain wrong  there are very few times the doors open up and you may enter and once you take a seat you will be there for a long time. For example if you get passed over for a promotion due to a feminist quota being in place at your company it will be an awfully long time until another promotion opportunity turns up again. So what she is really advocating is that men should voluntarily give up their few chances for advancement to let a woman have that advancement instead and be happy to never be promoted.

4335271,0,t1_cse4fav,I totally get what youre saying but heres my thought. The father is given his equal right to walk away and if he takes it hes out of the picture entirely. If the mother wants to keep the baby then she has to legally agree that she is the sole provider for the child financially and otherwise. This gets the state off the hook as well. If the mother doesnt agree and is unable to care for the child on her own then the baby does become the property of the state. In this case yes the state would have to pay for the baby temporarily. But in most places that Im aware of anyway the waiting list for baby adoptions is a mile long. Everyone whos adopting wants a baby. Which means that in many cases the state could have the baby adopted before its even born. End result being that the state makes money off of the situation.Honestly if men had equal rights to women this type of situation would likely happen far less frequently than it does now. If women were no longer able to trap a man via pregnancy then it might force people to be a bit more responsible when it comes to having sex. Im not saying I have all the answers I certainly dont. But I think most of us do agree that in the current world we live in men are expected to step up for their mistakes while women can kick back and collect checks or simply kill their baby. Whichever coordinates better with the mood they are in that day. P.S. Im a woman but I have no tolerance for the severe inequality I see around me. Two of my children are boys and they will be taught to respect themselves and those around them. They will also be taught to think before they act. Having said that I wouldnt be kind to anyone who tried to trap either of them. ,MensRights,csebc1a,1,t5_2qhk3

4475487,0,t1_csuse3x,When someone disputes that men are likely to get the short end of the stick in family courts they usually mean that men who seek custody in court are almost as likely to get custody as the mother. The thing is that is in fact the misleading statistic. Men are usually discouraged from seeking custody in court by their lawyers who tell them theyll very likely be wasting their time and money pursuing something they have little to no chance of winning considering the biases in the system. This isnt even counting the men who cant afford legal representation and are even more screwed in court. Basically the cases in which men actually contest custody are heavily skewed towards those in which the mother has some kind of disqualifying factor that gives men a fighting chance to get primary custody and thus producing custody statistics that can be misrepresented as being fairer than they really are. Theyre junk because they are excluding a very large percentage of custody arrangements. As for the patriarchy argument this is such a nebulous concept that I normally wouldnt even bother to respond to it. However for the sake of argument  Ill just say that even if patriarchy is the source of discrimination in child custody proceedings so what? Isnt sex discrimination supposed to be wrong? If there is a patriarchy shouldnt we be fighting it say by passing legislation like presumptive joint custody to undermine the system that they clain to oppose? Why do these people always seem to have specific policy and legal solutions that can be pursued immediately and enacted in the near future when it pertains to womens issues but the solution to mens issues is always the vague and unspecific smash the patriarchy and equality will maybe hopefully trickle down at some point in the future. In addition under this patriarchy women have the choice of working or staying at home or working parttime while men basically only have one option be the primary bread winner. This discrepancy in worklife balance is in no small part responsible for much of the inequality in child custody arrangements as it gives women the ability to be a childs primary caregiver while reducing men to little more than walking ATMs. Women are absolutely guilty along with men of helping prop up this status quo. A good example of this is many womens welldocumented unwillingness to date down and the many articles bemoaning the lack of marriageable men around due to the higher number of women graduating college these days than men of course the media seems to think that the only problem with boys falling behind in education is that it deprives women  of suitable mates because of course we ccould never expect women to be the primary breadwinners thats like a mans job.,MensRights,csut0nf,1,t5_2qhk3

But tell me how when someone is drunk they cant give consent unless its a male who had sex with a female? If  people are drunk then neither party can give consent. Yet men everywhere are being prosecuted on rape charges with the premise of the woman was drunk but it doesnt matter if the guy was drunk. Rape is an awful despicable inhuman action and any man who thinks they have the right to invade that should be treated  to life in prison. However this should be true for women too. People who say men cant be raped are ignorant and because of this stereotype police officers judges and the law in general dont take male on male or woman on male rape seriously. This leaves men with out options with some resulting in suicide. And in false rape cases men will lose their job credibility and some serve time in prison even if proven to be false accusations. People who are going to falsely accuse others of rape should receive punishment equal to that of an actual rapist because you would literally be ruining someones life.

My understanding through reading the article and looking at the measures themselves is that they used a modified version of the SES Long FormPerpetration short form only has info about vaginal and oral sex. It was modified by removing questions not related to completed sexual acts and by focusing solely on items related to forceful sexual contact . Using modified scales or just using specific subscales is extremely common in research. For example a commonly used scale for internalized homophobia was originally just a subscale from a larger measure that touched upon a few other aspects of negative attitudes. That being said yes it absolutely needs to be shown that removing questions  and  from the SES doesnt overly damage the internal consistency of the scale. If the results are comparable using the full scale and the modified scale then that can serve as a form of preliminary validation for the modified scale that is if using  vs  shows that there are no significant differences between the two sets of findings it becomes less worrisome to use the modified version. Alternatively if other studies have shown that using those three items is just as reliable as using all  then these authors wouldnt need to restate that. Im not sure if the authors mention this in their study I dont think so so that would be something to look for to see if its a strong critique or not. Conversely I actually have a major problem with items  and  they can easily be considered doublebarreled items or questions that ask multiple things which differ and can confuse participants. What if Ive told you lies but never threatened to end our relationship? What if I threatened to spread rumors and I was serious and therefore not telling you lies? Those kind of things affect participants answers. If they were broken down like your bold examples towards the end of your post they wouldnt be problematic. If I were involved in a study like this Id honestly hesitate to use those questions for sure and with valid reason.As for the definition of rape Im sorry but I definitely wasnt clear with what I meant there. By the three things in the FBI definition I meant that it was in reference to oral vaginal or anal penetration without consent. Those were the three to which I was referring but upon rereading I see it definitely wasnt clear in my writing. You are correct when you state that the root of the question constitutes rape although I wouldnt classify anything as a contradiction given the prominence of appropriate modification of measures. But here I feel as though I should stress that modifying measures is not a way of cherrypicking data to make ones case or influence ones outcomes. In fact that they used items  actually show they are only interested in situations which involve some level of physical control over the other partner. Removing the items that are focused more on guilt or social control actually gives us a clearer picture of that.I think the thing people generally struggle with is the idea of what is actually classifiable as rape versus what one might be held legally accountable for. If you and I were sexual partners and I coerced you into sex by any means to the point where your participation was ultimately against your will whether through lies or threats or physical force that is classified as rape under its current societal definition. That is entirely separate from what you might be able to get me prosecuted for because the way we as a society prosecute rape operates under a stricter definition often due to difficulties associated with the burden of proof. You not being able to take me to court has no bearing on whether or not what I did to you was an act that could be classified as rape. I know not a lot of people like to hear that.To answer your question about the possibility of people answering while glossing over the consent element keeping in mind that youre asking about the overall SES here and not the questions used in the study itself thats hard to say as that can happen on literally every survey question taken by anyone. Its no more likely that it will happen in the yes direction as it is in the no direction  that I see without consent and rush to answer no on all questions. ,MensRights,ct7j0m3,1,t5_2qhk3

4756718,0,t1_cttqqo3,Even after thousands of years of socalled patriarchy the word dick is so commonly used as to be nearly a nonoffensive noncurse word. Cunt on the other hand has a ridiculous amount of stigma attached to it. This gives women an inordinate amount of power. In effect we are told by society that men can be insulted without limit and any word or words from any dictionary can be used to do it. Women on the other hand are shrinking violets who may not be insulted  although they can dish it out just fine. Youre post is just repeating the same gynocentric message that we are constantly given by society  that men are to protect women even at their own expense. I do not accept this. The word cunt is just another word like every single one in the dictionary and it only has special status because it is forbidden. I see no reason why it should not be used. Your reason that society will not accept us as long as we use the word is total hogwash. Societys reasons for not accepting us have nothing to do with the use of the word cunt. Their reason for not accepting us is because we are nothing but disposable servants to them and if we refuse to accept that position in society then they will do everything they can to smear us  including deliberately conflating us with movements we have nothing to do with. The smear factory is not defeated by refraining from using the word cunt. The smear factory is defeated by demonstrating to people  that we do in fact have real issues that need to be addressed. The use of the word cunt does not indicate an unethical lack of compassion. Societys deliberate ignorance of men who suffer does. The word cunt is just like every other word. It should be used when its appropriate  including especially when the word fits some evil bitch like a glove.,MensRights,ctu4okp,2,t5_2qhk3

On the other hand even if youre downvoted that doesnt mean that the discussion will necessarily be bad.On the topic of patriarchy I think there are some problems with your argument.One is that the anthropological definition of patriarchy is often not how it is used by feminism. You might want to read about motte and baileyAs an example sometimes patriarchy is used synonymously with gender roles. If this is what patriarchy really means then by focusing on the male role you introduce a subtext that its men instead of society that are the problem even though it is a force that acts on both genders.It seems that the way patriarchy is used most of the time is the idea that men as a class oppress women as a class which is an extreme statement.Also while we havent head a female head of state that appears to not be due to bias against female politicians the statistics appear to show that women do better than men on average when running for office but that women rarely choose to run.,MensRights,ctu87au,4,t5_2qhk3

The point being that there is an insufficient amount of faithful women you inserted the extremely so I leave that as a failure on your part I never used such a quantifier.Just to be clear on that Ive included my original comment here note the lack of quantifiersgt a person who is truly faithful is rare and of real valuegt But getting back to the issue it seems like common sense that a guy that can pull is more valuable smvwise than a girl that does similarlyOf course but youre comparing the roles wrong it is not in a womans interest to get a lot of partners. Also that felt like a lot of slang it took me a minute to pick apart what you were saying pullget women? and smv sexual market value so I apologize if I misinterpret this segmentA man that can get a lot of partners would find equal comparison to a woman who gets a lot of sexual attention but selects with strict discretion. Youre comparing Brad Pitt to your local slut when you should be comparing him to a highly attractive woman who could have sex with just about anyone but doesnt.gt yes faithful women maybe getting rarer....that doesnt men we should give them medals for doing what used to be the bare minimumI never stated that we should!

A woman with fidelity is no good at all if shes not a good partner e.g. Unattractive abusive unintelligent etc..gt its like nice guys for example youre nice...so what?Nice guys have real value as well Youre nice but that isnt sufficient. Fidelity is also insufficient but that doesnt mean it isnt a desirable property with real world value.

Even after controlling for industry job title and experience the gap still exists.These are two separate statements. Yet it will be repeated as if the  wage gap exists after accounting for common life choices but it doesnt. A  gap exists after accounting for the obvious factors but c on the dollar! doesnt motivate people the same way so they dont mention that one in the speeches.gt what are the other reasons?Every life choice we account for shows men generally optimize for payearnings at a higher rate than women. The big ones are industry work hours and experience aka total years of employment. Men on average choose more lucrative fields work longer hours and have more total years working. All are completely legitimate reasons to be compensated at a higher rate and women who make similar choices also earn similar amounts.Given that every life choice we choose to account for reduces the gap between men and women. It is safe to say that the wage gap is almost entirely about different motivations on average between men and women.

4890139,0,t3_3hu6p1,The Duluth Model misuses data to create underlying false assumptions biased against men. It pedals itself as being about the Psychology of abuse and yet refuses to use Psychology in management and treatment of abuse. Models eschew psychological treatment even of empirically established factors supporting habits of intimate abusiveness. They have in effect removed a psychology of abusiveness from intervention and replaced it with a gender political model. In contrast to this model research from several longitudinal peer cohort studies shows that a propensity for IPV is predictable in both genders during adolescence.This rebuttal comes from Dr Donald Dutton one of the worlds leading authorities on the Psychology of both perpetrator and victim in IPV.gtTransforming a flawed policy A call to revive psychology and science in domestic violence research and practice  Aggression and Violent Behavior    doi.j.avb...gtAbstract Intimate partner violence IPV continues to be social problem in the United States. Unfortunately legislation aimed at solving the problem has been based on models of IPV that are not empirically supported. One example ispsychoeducationalintervention models legislated by the courts in many states. These models eschew psychological treatment even of empirically established factors supporting habits of intimate abusiveness. They have in effect removed a psychology of abusiveness from intervention and replaced it with a gender political model. In contrast to this model research from several longitudinal peer cohort studies shows that a propensity for IPV is predictable in both genders during adolescence. Yet treatment or prevention of psychological risk factors is either neglected or negatively legislated. This paper reviews the prevailing criminal justice intervention model provides examples of how the paradigm supporting this model distorts interpretation of research and compares this flawed research with methodologically superior studies suggesting a different and potentially more effective approach.Best of all this  paper was attacked publicly and subjected to critical analysis which many were unable to understand. Dutton the consummate professional then respondedgtAbstract Gondolf has criticized our review as being selective and suggests that the Duluth model is more promising than we had concluded. We note that his own outcome study showed a failure rate for a Duluth program of identical to the mean rate of the studies we reviewed. We see his critiques as representative of the very mindset we described in our original paperthat of the gender paradigm. We review some of the shortcomings of Gondolfs critique as representative of this mindset. Our conclusion about the failure of the Duluth program remains unchanged.gtIn our paper Transforming a flawed policy we reviewed empirical evidence that contradicted the feminist gender paradigm claim that intimate partner violence IPV was primarily a gender issue. Incidence statistics we argued demonstrated that in North America personality disturbance and not gender was a better predictor of IPV. All policies that were based on the gender paradigm were ipso facto flawed by being improperly premisedThe Duluth model A dataimpervious paradigm and a failed strategy  Aggression and Violent Behavior    doi.j.avb...gtThe bureaucratactivists of certifying agencies and batterer treatment programs have become true believers disregarding research that does not support their views Dutton amp Nicholls . They are enthralled with the power that comes with having ones philosophy hold sway and the control they feel from influencing criminal justice policy. Ironically they often attribute these very power and control motives to abusive men. There is no other explanation for resisting treatment that would disprove their philosophy but make the lives of women safer. Is time to relinquish this hegemony of policy and allow the treatment of abusive men women and families by professionals who can make clear judgments about appropriate treatment e.g. couples therapy family therapy and group therapy for one or both of the couples members and end the current dysfunction in criminal justice process. Treatment modalities exist that show great promise but are not tried for political reasons. Psychologists social workers and other helping professionals have not only a broader array of researchbased behavioral change technologies available to them but also a commitment to rigorous codes of ethics. These codes of ethics may vary in the details but all leave no doubt as to the primacy of human dignity growth and safety. Further these codes of ethics promote dynamic scientific views of practice excluded from the approved interventions promulgated by the state certifying agencies APA  Howard McMillen amp Pollio . gtgtThose with continued allegiance to the patriarchal view should stand back and ask themselves if their primary motivation is to advance the safety of women and families or to preserve a selfinterested political stance. The patriarchal view played an important role in addressing domestic violence. If not for the early groundbreaking work of victims rights advocates and feminist activists it is not likely that domestic violence would be so recognized as an important social welfare and public health issue. In the evolution of public policy responses to social problems the path often followed is an initial politicizing of the issue followed by programs followed by evaluations research followed by a more detailed specification of etiology risk and program response. This process has been impeded by the ideological strictures inherent in the patriarchal view. The science has moved well beyond the policy. It is time for the policy to change.Dutton has spoken often on the misuse of ideology over evidence for the promotion of Feminist Politics. One of the best talks was given at the  From Ideology to Inclusion EvidenceBased Policy and Intervention in Domestic Violence. February   Sacramento California.Duttons talk sounds daunting but is very easy to follow and a real eye opener. Its on YouTube and published there by John Hamel the driving force behind PASK the worlds largest DV study and analysis published .Biased Assimilation Belief Perseverance Groupthink and the Social Psychology of the Domestic Violence Movement As Dutton says in his book Rethinking Domestic ViolencegtFeminist activists have had a powerful effect on social policy in NorthAmerica. Criminal justice intervention is much more aggressive than it was in the early . Feminists have also inuenced courtmandated handling of arrested perpetrators. Eschewing psychological explanations for wife assault feminists have opted instead for interventions based on a psychoeducational model developed in Duluth Minnesota.gtgtThe initial effect of the feminist paradigm in practice was to focus so exclusively on male intimate violence that female violence was overlooked entirely not denied just never discussed. Corvo and Johnson outline the bedrock view of feminist thought that battering by males is NEVER provoked hereditary out of control accidental an isolated incident. It is not caused by disease diminished intellect alcoholismaddiction mental illness or any external person or event. it is a means for men to systematically dominate disempower control and devalue women it is greater than an individual act it supports the larger goal of oppression of women.

Protective orders are routinely made in conjunction with allegations of domestic violence  and they go into effect immediately. In other words whether or not the underlying complaint is ultimately dismissed or whether or not the defendant is eventually acquitted. When cities like mine went to mandatory arrest policies pushed by feministsdomestic violence advocates who were  and are  convinced that domestic violence is purely a male on female phenomenon arrests of women increased substantially. Because when before police would walk away when the man was the victim now theyre arresting the woman.Thats not what feminists wanted so now theyre pushing for primary aggressor policies according to which police are supposed to arrest whoever is most afraid.The nonDuluth nonfeminist studies on the other hand consistently show that women are as likely to use violence in intimate relationships as men.

The problem is how you weight each individual contributing factor.  You can skew the result any way you want by choosing an appropriate set of weights.  So in practice this is a very subjective exercise no matter how well you try to quantify oppression.The reality is that we are all oppressed in different ways.  There are concrete tangible ways that women do have it worse than men.  But there are a large number of other concrete tangible ways in which men have it worse.  Similarly with respect to race sexual orientation age height etc.  For me the key is empathy trying to maintain an openwide enough perspective to understand where another person might be coming from.  On any individual day I can be a towering success or an abject failure at this.  What I hate about feminism as currently practiced is that it encourages its adherents to have zero empathy for men or really anybody other than white women.,MensRights,cumaa7f,2,t5_2qhk3

5000704,0,t1_cune5d3,I dont think governments have a very easy time changing culture or societal mindset. The Obama administration is obviously feminist but still people claim we live in a patriarchy using the word to suggest oppression to women is systematic. In fact in the States more women vote than men so the politicians should be more concerned with womens welfare politicians are always more concerned with the populations that actually vote for them. With that said I do understand your reasoning for viewing it as a patriarchy by definition and its probably all semantics on my part for not liking it. Even here in America most of the politicians are men. I guess its just that its no longer a forced patriarchy whereas I feel like true patriarchies are ones in which women are legally barred from participating. I dont live in China and dont know enough to determine any objective life quality comparison between men and women there though being aborted is no fun so youre probably right with that too.I would just rather blame the individuals with the power not the male gender. Not that patriarchy inherently blames men but a lot of people would jump to blaming all men simply hearing the word patriarchy. Youre absolutely correct that the people in power are mostly men and patriarchy surely fits that description no question about it. I dont want the term patriarchy to elicit misdirected misandry from idealistic impressionable young women. You arent one of those though and at this point I feel like Im talking too much because I really dont want to argue with someone who appears to want all the same things as me.

5147822,0,t3_3li391,I found it to be rather a big departure from his wellpublicized nearabsolutist beliefs about free speech and free expression. I suspect hes got a few hangups about sex.Chomskys big message is that government is oppressive because it represents the interests of the powerful rather than the people. Well if porn is to be banned I dont know if thats what Chomsky wants but that IS what antiporn feminists definitely want then youre advocating that the Oppressive Guvmint be given the power to criminalize certain kinds of publishing censor magazines block internet sites determine what IS and ISNT art and suppress the mail. And such power could obviously be used against Chomsky and his allies rather easily. The Comstock Laws of the th century for instance expanded to criminalize the mailing of family planning literature and contraception. Then of course contemporary countries that DO ban porn include such utopian bastions of female equality like Iran and Saudi Arabia while countries with widespread freelyavailable porn include such backwards hellholes as the Netherlands and Germany.And youre correct The antiporn people on the left never talk about the vast variety of gay porn because it would destroy their own arguments. To be an antiporn feminist you need to believe that gay porn is fine but straight porn causes evil.Then there is the libertarian argument that to believe that porn oppresses women also heavily implies that women who sign contracts to star in pornographic media signed their contracts under duress or something. So this would bring into question womens contractsigning abilities should women not be ALLOWED to sign certain contracts? Were supposed to believe that women have their own independent wills and drives but women who fck on film are bubbleheaded dupes of the patriarchy and need adult supervision about where they ought to sign their own names?

5239245,0,t1_cvheaxa,There is no doubt that the founding fathers were exceptional men in their time as were the principals upon which the the country was established.  I would agree those principles had much to do with the world being brought out of the dark ages.  Things began to deteriorate right after WWI and by WWII the mold was cast.  It has been a continual decline from that point.The metrics are many but here are a few.Notwithstanding its founding principles the US is the most religious country in the developed world.  A politician cannot get elected if he said he was an atheist.  The president must say God Bless America after every major address to the citizenry.  What religion and which sect heshe allegedly belongs to is a major concern for the country.The US is the only developed country that has the death penalty thereby sharing company with countries like Iran Yemen Saudi Arabia etc. etc.  Politicians regularly attempt to curtail female contraception and abortion.  To this very day the US refuses to sign on to a number of international laws like the UN declaration for the rights of the child.  Why?  Because under US law a minor can be executed by hisher government.  Apparently the US wants to retain that prerogative.Then there is the numerous breaches of international law the country is a signatory to.  Torture was an executive policy and now it has been replaced by assassination where the killing of innocent bystanders is acceptable or the wrong guy for that matter. The secret illegal prisons are still with us. Since August   and the decades that followed  the war crimes are too numerous to mention here.  However it appears that nothing was learned from the tragedy that was the Vietnam War.The US Government is on the record saying it will not sign on to the International Criminal Court because it believes that a number of its officials could end up being prosecuted for international crimes.The US has lost it democracy and has been involved in undermining the democracy of many governments of other countries as well as supporting brutal despots throughout the globe.  In the aggregate the US Government is the most hated government among the global population.The US has over  military installations throughout for world.Internally the US has the highest economic inequality in the developed world as well as the worst social programs.  Organized concentrate wealth is OK but if an ordinary worker wants to organize the US has among the worst labor law and lowest unionization rates in the developed world.  Yet the average American is told they are endowed with too many entitlements.But the subsidies to major corporation through tax loopholes and government spending is so out of control that the country spends more on military contracts with private companies than any other country.  In fact it spends more on its military than all other OECD countries combined.An incarceration rate that rivals the rest of the globe.Gun laws and a death rate from them that truly set the US apart from any OECD country. The most violent country in the OECD both domestically and internationally.  I am sure the above will bring the ire of many but dont blame me.  All of this is well known and on the record and unique to the US as compared with the rest of the developed world TODAY.  I truly hope things change in the USA because as the only world super power and a global leader change in your country for the better would benefit the world in general and  of Americans as well.  Otherwise the US is simply going to continue to give the worlds despots purchase for their own crimes and oppression.,MensRights,cvhip0g,1,t5_2qhk3

5244144,0,t1_cvi3h9q,You stated thatgt from a psychological perspective her posting that does nothing in favor of his case.The argument you are made was. it is possible that the accuser made positive statements about the accused after having been raped.. therefore the evidence has no value.I dont think the only evidence that has value in court is evidence that can only be consistent with innocence or guilt.  For evidence to have value it only has to change the liklihood of a theory of innocence or guilt.So while it is possible the the girls had been raped but still thought they were in love with the accused when they wrote those statements the evidence by itself makes it more likely that they had not been raped.I think in most real world cases it is how the various pieces of evidence connect when taken together that makes it possible to decide that the accused is guilty to a high degree.I dont think you really bought your own argument.  If you did then why didnt you apply it to the accusation the girls made against the boy and conclude that because people have falsely accused others of crimes in order to hurt them that the accusation has no value in court?,MensRights,cvi3x3r,2,t5_2qhk3

The lack of father figures which the mother would be entirely complicit inher choices in partners lifestyles and pregnancy creates a lack of traditional masculinity yes but the bigger problem is the greater majority of women who directly impose and enforce that traditional masculinity onto men and who isolate reject abuse and bully those who fail to meet those expectations and entitlements. The overrepresentation of women in those boys lives can also often lead to an incredible vulnerability to female approval as well. This is made exponentially worse by the fact that no one will hold women accountable for exploiting that vulnerability in boysmenbecause it is unmasculine and girls can do no wrong and by the fact that it directly contradicts with the very masculinity that women expect of themmen who are vulnerable to women are viewed as unmasculine therefore deserving of further abuse. The problem is not so much the lack or presence of masculinity it is rather the way women impose that masculinity onto men and the way those men are treated by women for failing to meet their expectations.

5455644,0,t1_cw8ydij,Actually on that topic I was wondering about the number of male victims.  I cant find it yet but there seems to have been a significant jump in the rate after the new definition.  NOT the . increase.  This article is misleading.  I think the . figure normalizes out the change in definitions. In  the last year where all agencies used the old definition the rate is about  per k population.   In  almost all agencies are using the new definition and the rate is about  per k population.    I skipped  because there both definitions were used about equally so there could be systematic weighting problems.So I would guess that there are about      per k population additional rape victims due to the new definition effect.  Assuming they are males makes men  of all rape victims under the new definition.EDIT I am of course assuming the definitionindependent change in actual crime rates between  and  is negligible.,MensRights,cw90dnw,1,t5_2qhk3

Theyre terrified of being branded gay.CtrlF puberty. Nothing found. Why would it be in the interest of a newly girlcrazy boy to send a message out that hes homosexual? If gestures have meanings its not in the power of a thirteen year old to make the gesture but disavow the meaning. And this cant be blamed on homophobic shitlord jocks  on the contrary jocks can be quite tactile with each other because snark about homosociality notwithstanding their heterosexual status isnt seriously in question. But slowdeveloping or shy boys who arent seen in romantic contexts with girls but have close friendships with other boys their age  these days boys like that are assumed to be gay.gt  So theres absolutely no touching and no crying anymore. They have to suppress their emotions as they move into secondary school and unlike girls are therefore constantly uncomfortable and distracted in the learning environment.Managing your emotions and acting like a grownup is part of moving into the big school.gt The experts concluded that the stigma surrounding male emotion was the probable cause of the gender education gap. Cayenne spoke of Troops to Teachers a program in which exarmy personnel are brought into secondary schools to teach. This scheme was introduced by education officials who believed that a lack of discipline had led to the disparity between genders. However the panel unanimously agreed that this was not the case and that encouraging emotion in schoolboys may instead be the most effective solution.gt Men dont seem to be drawn to creative subjects Wimbush says and I dont know why this is. Is there a taboo in boys being conscientious being devoted to their work in some way? And if so why?gt Possibly through societys expectations boys are being dissuaded from these humanities courses because they are subjects in which a little emotion may be useful? Especially in literature paying attention to your emotions is a way of understanding the work that you are studying. Boys tend to have what we call in literature the hermeneutics of suspicion  which means that if they feel a writer is trying to affect them emotionally in some way they try to undermine that and pick it apart.That seems like a good thing to me  boys as critical readers resistant to emotional appeals. The study of the humanities used to mean that instead of starting from a blank slate in each generation we can learn from the adult wisdom of past generations. Its adult wisdom because it cant be processed through the emotions and life experience of a teenager but a teenager is maybe just mature enough to learn something if hes humble and pays attention.  Asking Whats your personal response to this work of art? How do you feel about this? is not only the way to drive most teenage boys up the wall its backwards teaching  do teenagers really need any encouragement in thinking everything in the world revolves around their emotions?When my high school English teacher told us wed be reading Pride and Prejudice the boys in the class groaned. But to everyones surprise most of the boys loved the book. We didnt need a point of identification  Im neither attracted to Mr Darcy nor do I think I am Mr Darcy. It was the authorial voice of Jane Austen that the boys were impressed by the precisely drawn sketches of relationships the droll commentaries. When boys were asked about the book words like sharp and precise came up. Jane Austen was a wise adult from past ages and we learned something from her.

5896174,0,t3_3vzi2k,I think most people will say that no of course its not okay to hit anybody. With that being said if a woman poses an immediate threat to your physical integrity then yes absolutely its okay to hit a woman. The problem here is that too many people have made a few presumptions about what tradition and chivalry actually state about the matter.A lot of people think that first of all a man should never hit a woman under any circumstances. What they dont seem to appreciate is that the idea is not to hit a lady. A lady wont be pummeling a man for no reason in the first place. In other words the idea is to restrain oneself from abusing ones physical superiority and using it where inappropriate. Having an argument with somebody is not a good reason to hit anybody and since a lady wont be using physical force in the first place this should never be a problem.Secondly its simply presumed that women would never take advantage of a situation where a man simply wont hit back even in selfdefense. On a case by case basis you probably wont have much need to punch a woman in the mouth even if she hits you first. For example if your grandmother slaps you for being a sassmouth there arent many people who are going to rush to your defense when you rearrange her nose. Sometimes you just gotta take it. Random chicks on the street with a little bit of liquid courage in them arent protected by these familial ties and as such are fair game in my opinion. White knights wont see it that way so be careful when you finally decide youve had enough of her abuse.,MensRights,cxsitkl,1,t5_2qhk3

Im not sure there really are many of those. People have called Steve Jobs a genius but he was more of a marketing genius than anything else. Sell the hype and people buy. Most companies run fairly well unless someone at the top screws it up or the industry changes out from under them.Now STEM... STEM is an area where we objectively have geniuses.

The most valuable members of a community is always the females and the children. You need females to sustain population but you only need one malethis will lead to genetic defectsbut the population will still manage.     This is why males have almost always been the fighters throughout history. They are expendable.     If a community loses  of its males it can bounce back in a generation or two but if it loses  of its females it might never recover.     And this goes beyond just humans too. Many communal species exhibit this trait. Ants for example. Every single member will die in defence of the one breeding female because they know that losing the breeding female population means certain death for their community.,MensRights,cyuia7t,9,t5_2qhk3

Most politicians on either side even if they personally support mens rights wouldnt go against their party to support them.

6233888,0,t3_40lc95,I see something like this being more harmful than helpful to mens rights. We dont want to discuss the privileges of being born female. Women need their gender privilege thrown in their face as much as we gentlemen do not at all.Its less aggressive more efficient and more logical to post the absent rights of being born male.. Males are not born with reproductive rights. Their genetic material does not belong to them! Even if a male is forced to penetrate by a female rapist and the rapist gets pregnant the rape victim which is the male in this case to clarify would still be legally responsible to provide child support to his rapist for the welfare of the baby.. Males do not have family rights. Forget divorce a man would nearly need to be a widower to be able to claim custody of his children.. Males are assumed to be impossible to rape in social areas of Western society and legal areas of Eastern society because of sexist dogma that claims men are inherently always willing to have sex. This is further misrepresented by an erect penis equating to conscious sexual desire.. Males are born without the right to bodily integrity and firstworld nations still practice circumcision with little regard to further research into alternative genital maintenance practices or technologies.. Males have no support centers or outreach hotlines in exclusivity. Mens support centers offer to help them basically become less of the stereotypical Man as defined by outrageous feminist standards and weed out elements of toxic masculinity as if that was the only reason that a man could be in crisis  that he was just too manly enough and was sexisming all over the place. Outreach hotlines can be worse more accusatory and in some countries offensive enough in design to keep men from wanting to use it  which leaves the public with the impression that the service was never needed in the first place. This is in contrast to womens support centers which will offer to house and care for an abused woman and her children offer abuse counselling legal help assistance in getting set up independently of the abuser... abused men seem to be treated less like assault victims and more like the guy who lost the prize fight. Worth some pity but no help.. Males have no exclusive scholarships. Women are unrestricted in scholarship terms and if a scholarship award emerged that a woman could not earn because of her gender all hell would break loose until women were permitted to vie for the award  even if its title was F.A.L.O.S. Organizations Most Rugged Gentleman Award of Hairychested Excellence  the fight would not stop until it was an inclusive scholarship.. Males are presumed to be the aggressor attacker or the responsible party in a splitgender physical conflict. Even if the male was severely injured law enforcement will respond as though the incident was instigated by him. Their rationale? He should know better than to get into a fight with a woman which oozes so full of illogic it would take two paragraphs to pull that one phrase apart and disprove every ounce of it.,MensRights,cyy84bf,2,t5_2qhk3

6262495,0,t3_41cwlb,Interesting fact there is a similarlysized income gap between selfemployed women and selfemployed men. A selfemployed woman is her own boss and sets her own hours there is no evil male boss around to underpay her. What explains that? Well obviously the selfemployed woman is working differently from the selfemployed man. Not worse just differently.So really even if women and men are doing the same work a crucial question to ask is are the women doing anything differently from the men? Are they not equallyproductive for consecutive years in the workforce? And the answer is by and large YES. Men are more willing to take hardship postings more willing to work extra hours more willing to takeon more risks more willing to specialize etc. And the result of that is men earn more money and also live lessbalanced lives. And no one is allowed to say these things for some reason if you do you need to chalk it up to sexism so men are to be blamed for women not working more hours and not working in more dangerous conditions and so on for crying out loud.I could goon like this for hours comingup with more and more examples but I wont. The more you digin to the feminist claims on this issue the more facts you can see that theyre not telling you and the more dishonest they start to look. But believing women are being discriminatedagainst is way more appealing than mere reality. It activates some powerful button in peoples brains which overwhelms everything else.Everyone is so terrified of discriminating against women or even looking like it that they will promote obviously underqualified women and people are so eager to applaud female success whether or not it is honestly earned that they will laud a woman even when they know she got her job due to lessthanstraightforward means. And ludicrously people are supposed to pretend that there is nothing untoward about that kind of situation. So when that happens everyone is lying and everyone knows that they are lying but it would be bad for a person to comeout and actually say it.

While some issues like unfair sentencing and education deserve real discussion while other things like one restaurant somewhere in the middle of Nowhere USA experimenting with a unisex bathroom instead of a mens room barely deserve out attention let alone our discussion.To add to the problem anyone whose view doesnt match or dissents from that of the original post or the conclusion drawn from it is bullied and trolled out of the discussion. I wish I could chalk this up to someone spotting a feminist but sadly Ive brushed through a few heavily active threads and found that people with actual thought to bring to a discussion even if its to play the Devils Advocate to which you can tell the difference from a troll have been put through the wringer as if to satisfy a need to be right. As if theres a legitimate war being fought and to back down or surrender would be the end. As a result dissenting views are trashed and men who hold them are treated as if theyre inferior brainwashed and feminized.If that wasnt bad enough the rules of the subreddit do nothing to discourage this sort of exchange and I personally feel the mods could do more to ensure that a discussion deals with the topic rather than attacking the speakers.

Then comics like these come out pointing out that no the original statistic never takes these into account and instead of saying where exactly did I learn this information? you poopoo all over the comic instead.Again lacking of critical thought. Here let me give you a really fucking obvious place to start. Again its very explicit about who the  cents statistic applies to fulltime yearround workers. Not differentiated by career. Not differentiated by hours. Just a raw comparison of fulltime yearround men to fulltime year round women. Wikipedia even conveniently links you to the census data so you could even dig into it if you wanted.And if youre going to be the sort of uncritical smart ass who sees the adjusted CONSAD report data and says look theres still a gap! Well thats another common ideological fallacy namely that it ignores two important things Feminists still push the  argument and not the  argument meaning they dont actually care. As the CONSAD report itself points out this gap could also be unaccounted for data or errors in the application of the current data. There might not actually be a gap.So to say that theres a gap as opposed to a difference is without any basis.,MensRights,czlj4tt,1,t5_2qhk3

6445253,0,t3_43ux5i,Pure anecdote but my mother is STILL technically thousands behind on child support Im almost  to my father.I do wonder sometimes if the difference in enforcement is due to how few fathers really seriously chase that child support cash compared to mothers. My father and I were dirt poor not can I really afford this new TV? poor but We can have somewhere to live OR we can eat this week poor when I was growing up and could have really used the cash but my father was proud and didnt want to make a fuss over it or appear like he couldnt support his family so he didnt chase it up.This was in stark contrast to my police officer uncle who was in court every other month with his exwife because of her constantly increasing child support demands and denying him access rights and all the rest.If that attitude from fathers who are owed child support is as common as I suspect it is it would be easy for a culture to develop in the bureaucracy to treat men a certain way and women another. ,MensRights,czlz9n7,1,t5_2qhk3

6445906,0,t1_czlzxxx,Thanks for the reply.Could have gone without all the caps one word sentences quoting like were in a high school debate bolding and italicisising for emphasis but whatever. I was saying what your comment could be perceived as. I explicitly stated that I knew what you actually were trying to get across and I agree with the most part. Where our viewpoints differ is that I think that theres a point of inebriation incapacitation where verbal consent is invalid. We hear a lot of real world experiences here so Ill tell you what happened to my close friend who happens to be a lesbian. She was going through a really bad time and was at a point of alcoholism. She met up with a few friends at a club they had fun but it got to the point in the night where she was getting too drunk. Her friends ditched her because apparently she was being embarrassing. Eventually she remembered getting kicked out for passing out vomiting in the toilets. She doesnt remember much from his point but she remembers being in a kebab shop on the strip talking to people. Then someone taking her for a long walk and then getting in a car with one guy driving. He would have obviously been sober. As I said she doesnt remember the dialogue but for all she knew this guy could have been taking her on a trip to Disneyland. She remembers being in his apartment not being able to get up from the couch then nothing. Just waking up in bloody sheets a torn vagina bruises everywhere and what seemed like a concussion. The guy said now Ill take you home. We have to fill in the blanks here but we can make a pretty decent assumption that the guy offered to take her home she drunkenly accepted probably as a good alternative to the gutter. The guy didnt take her home but to his apartment and then had rough sex with her. Was there consent? Maybe. Maybe the guy started touching her asked her if she liked that and she mumbled yes. She probably had no idea what was going on. She probably was half passed out for the whole thing. But because she may have mumbled yes at some point whether that be out of confusion not understanding what he said or just by being scared that automatically gives this sober piece of scum a free pass to take a incapacitated woman who could barley speak home have what must have been very painful sex with her and just leave. Is that okay? She probably consented at some point right? Shes clearly responsible for her own actions. And no she didnt bring it up to anyone but her very close friends. She doesnt want to talk about it and is absolutely terrified of proceeding with litigation because she will be the drunk girl who ruined that poor young mans life.,MensRights,czm1p6n,-3,t5_2qhk3

The presence or absence of a biological link doesnt mean squat  ask any adoptive parent. You probably want to do some research about your specific risk factors in terms of divorce. You keep presenting it as inevitable which is far from the truth. Deliberately becoming a single parent is like breaking your own leg  or your kids leg! before a skiing trip  you avoid the risk of trauma in the future by inflicting certain trauma at the beginning of the endeavour. But Im not even suggesting that marriage is necessary  there are lots of umarried coparents in this world including cohabitants. Im just saying that its not OK to deliberately deprive children of their other parent or to rent a poor womans body to make yourself a designer baby. By far the biggest offenders in the peasantrenting racket are rich straight couples but its revolting no matter who is doing it.If you really really want your children to have both parents in their lives then you need to find somebody with the same goal and make an agreement with them to share power and responsibility. It doesnt have to be a wife or a romantic partner or even a female  ethical surrogacy options exist in America. If you cant do any version of that if you are simply not equipped to take the risk of commiting to a twodecade involvement with another adult  then dont bring a new life into the world.

That Christina Hoff Sommers though she might disagree with a lot of what the Slut Walker types might have to say she still gets a gleem in her eye as she talks about Oh girls now are completely leaving boys in the dust in school with NO mention at all as to the fact that this is nothing more than an ILLUSION because schools are run by Feminists who gerry rig everything to teach to girls and deliberately mark down boys.

I was reading this other story where these black girls claimed they were beat up by white people and the university did a rally for them and even Hillary Clinton tweeted her support and it turns out they were actually beating up a white girl and her friends stopped them. They were never hit in the video just restrained from hitting the white girl. Now theyre going on trial for assault. Thats what happens when you stupidly jump to conclusions. Liberals want the world to be the way they see it so badly that the second anything matches up black person or woman or whatever being oppressed somehow they automatically defend them and assume it to be true because in their fucked up world women and black people are constantly being oppressed by the patriarchy and racism every second of the day so it must be true and they have to support it to bring light to these injustices.,MensRights,d0eqz5z,5,t5_2qhk3

6731756,0,t1_d0fljv5,Had this not involved the courts in Kehas case specifically I dont know enough about the Santoro case to comment on his case and it does not change the crux of my point anyways I would agree with you wholeheartedly. But perjuring oneself on the stand is a serious crime because it perverts the course of justice and ends up using the courts to send the government acting in a direction contrary to how it should thus entrapping the populace in complicity with the lie and consequences thereof.If you are on the standand especially under oath you tell the truth. Period. You dont get to turn around and complain that people are upset when it later comes out that you perjured yourself. Keha is lucky the DA that oversaw her case isnt pursuing perjury charges as it is.Furthermore it most definitely does throw doubt onto her case because without any concrete evidence of the alleged assaults the only thing we have to go on is her word against Lukes. That means the moment it becomes clear that her credibility is shot such as if she perjures herself or can be demonstrated to have made false statements about the incident in question that we dont even have her word because her word can no longer be trusted on its merits.So we have a musical artist that wants out of a exclusive contract she willingly submitted to even after Sony made reasonable accommodations and said she didnt have to work with Luke and when that didnt work she pulled the Sex Abuse card then undermines her own allegations by either perjuring herself or lying after the fact making it clear that at SOME point she lied about being sexually assaulted with the very real possible motive of using it for personal benefit thus undermining legitimate victims of sexual assault regardless of the incident in which she is lying...Id say the vitriol is quite welldeserved given the circumstances.,MensRights,d0fmfb8,1,t5_2qhk3

I wouldnt ever do something like that though but I still could. Then again I could carry a knife and just stab people at random in a crowd or get a gun and go nuts. So could a woman as well.The thing is that just because I can it definitely doesnt mean that I will even if I were coerced I wouldnt do something like that.

6761186,0,t3_48bzb3,I always agree that a movement should be self critical and looking to the opposition is a great way to improve oneself. Some of the criticism towards the MRM is actually pretty accurate like the fact that we dont get much accomplished especially when compared to feminism.The thing is that its still a fairly young movement and its just starting to gain some traction and widespread attention. Before being able to actually do things we need to be able to have our point of view not only heard but actually actively listened to and taken serious. Thats pretty much whats going on right now a striving towards the recognition of our issues. Before that is achieved none of us can really do much more else.Thats not to say that the MRM isnt making a difference its making a huge difference in the lives of a lot of both men and women around the world. Its not just as visible or measurable as other things. Mens shelters are just starting to actually appear a bit here and there and hopefully that trend will grow as time goes on.The MRM is also very big on not censoring and not coddling anyones ideas or reasoning. If theres flaws in an argument or logic they will usually get called out if someones too extreme they will usually get ignored or downvoted. But theres also the fact that it often takes rather significant circumstances to find this movement so there are bound to be a bit of anger and resentment going on as well.

The other reason is that certain people thought there were health benefits to it however studies show that there are no real health benefits.As a result there are no specific reasons to perform it unless there are specific health concerns.

6805830,0,t3_48y4fi,Im a circumcised male so Ill answer.  Its wrong for me because I lost  of the nerves in my dick.  Its wrong for me because I lost a lot of skin which hampered the growth of my dick and its smaller than it otherwise would be Ive been doing some tugging exercises to try to grow the foreskin back and my dicks gotten much thicker in the process which was unexpected.  If you dont think losing skin limits the size of a dick try taking some skin out of a balloon and see if it affects the size of the balloon.  When I fuck for a long time which is rare because I have really bad premature ejaculation so I get like fifteen seconds of friction and then its over  a problem which is correlated with circumcision I need to use lube because my skin doesnt glide like its supposed to so theres more actual friction between my and her flesh leading to her or me feeling raw and having to stop.  Ive got hair on the shaft of my dick because my body had to send nexttodick skin up onto the shaft to make up for what was lost and this exacerbates the sexmakesusraw problem.  The glans of my dick is the least sensitive piece of flesh on my body.  Ive tested this by brushing it lightly with a toothpick and then comparing that to the sensation of lightly brushing other parts of my body with a toothpick.  It is less sensitive than my hands than my wrists than my cheeks but also other notoriously numb areas like the skin of my elbow or under the heel of my foot.  I literally cannot find another patch of skin on my body that is less sensitive than the glans the head of my dick.  This is because what is supposed to be basically an internal organ as internal as your tongue at least is now an external organ that rubs against my clothes all day.  Its wrong for me because I believe that having unanesthetized surgery while I was an infant traumatized me is it okay to cut off a babys earlobe with a pair of scissors?  Would you worry that in addition to the physical effects that the experience itself might affect the babys developing brain?.  I believe that this in part led to an increased sensitization to pain.  The correlation between infant circumcision and having a low pain tolerance later in life has been established statistically.  And finally its simply wrong for me because something that was mine was taken from me.,MensRights,d0nqhvg,3,t5_2qhk3

This isnt victim blaming  no amount of equality laws is going to change this reality. Criminals are rather notorious for NOT following the rules... I know my abilities and weaknesses and make decisions to minimize my risk such as avoiding high risk situations that would leave me in a gravely vulnerable state and taking responsibility for my own safety.  oooh name calling.. how dreadful. it does happen its happened to me a few times she seems to forget tho that the men that did this were.. uhm.. just rejected do you think they arent going to be hurt by that? Does she think they arent offended? did she consider that maybe her attitude about the way she rejected him might have been a factor?  im not justifying men for getting upset but i have little doubt that it hurts to be rejected. it hurts me when i reject a man because i really dont want to hurt them i just cannot possibly accept every approach that is made. its a gross imbalance of power thats not fair but it is an example of WOMEN having such a huge advantage in the dating space and MEN feeling at such a huge disadvantage getting rejected when they approach doesnt justify an abusive response but she should at least understand that he has feelings too. just as he should try to understand hers. Being called a name is offensive but it doesnt actually cause any damage. grow up... TV mostly portrays men as childish idiots and women as responsible and mature. cry me a river chivalry is dying because feminists are demonizing men for every aspect of masculinity berating them for chivalrous acts treating them like pariah for the horrible crime of having a penis. what the T do you expect? This is ENTIRELY CAUSED by feminism.   if a woman can totally opt out of parental responsibility by choosing to get an abortion over an unplanned pregnancy why doesnt the man also have an option to opt out of parental responsibilities when they both made the exact same mistake?  youll have to ask the author i have no clue what she even meant and in case you missed it  i disagreed with her on pretty much every point in the article  if women want to be seen as the intellectual equivalent of men we need to demonstrate that we are. complaining about it wont change this perception it just makes you look like a crybaby. Women overwhelmingly take easier degree programs education humanities liberal arts womens studies sociology nursing while men overwhelmingly take more intellectually challenging courses such as engineering math business administration finance specialized medicine. There are NO barriers to women entering STEM programs they just dont do it in any significant numbers. a rehash but also factually incorrect. men are raped over twice as often as women every year according to FBI annual Crime statistics. surprised you missed this one statistics show that women commit domestic violence against men at pretty much the same rate as men commit domestic violence against women. men are stronger but they are no more prone to violence than women are. being portrayed in a negative light only matters if you care.  this is meaningless. i dont rate my self worth on other peoples opinions. not just proven false its incredibly obvious that the people making up these claims are intentionally distorting the statistics to create the illusion of the pay gap no honest review of pay differences comes anywhere close to . if it were true then every company would be firing men to replace them with these cheaper alternatives. a female making a claim of rape or domestic abuse is taken far more seriously than a male making the exact same claim women have access to shelters support networks that are simply not available for men at all.  already covered this  a natural result of demanding affirmative action  totally self imposed  if you lower the standards for some ridiculous diversity goal then you should have expected exactly this outcome. This is obviously an example of someone desperate to claim some victim status because they are twisting the PRIVILEGE of being given SPECIAL TREATMENT as a disadvantage  truly unbelievable stupidity here. boo hoo hoo... women are the MOST guilty of this. stop blaming this bs on the patriarchy   she makes some blanket assumption that ALL WOMEN must be feminists but most have to HIDE the FACT. totally wrong.. I believe in equality under the law. This does NOT mean that we have equal abilities nor does it mean that we are equally qualified to do every job. Feminism is NOT about equality it is about FEMALE RIGHTS exclusively and many of the feminist leaders are radically misandric calling for castration or incarceration and the elimination of masculinity while complaining about the lack of chivalry because they lost the spot on their princess pedestal....   Do they not comprehend just how retarded they sound? I love most women but i absolutely despise what feminism has become and the damage that it is doing to men. If they actually believed in equality they should be outraged at what is happening in education to male students.

6853988,0,t1_d0sot3x,It sounds like you have PTSD and that does not get better with time.  It has to be actively treated.  A diagnosis of PTSD requires anxiety symptoms lasting over  months.  The first step is to get your GP to refer you to a psychiatrist who will do a diagnosis prescribe meds and refer you to a psychologist or therapist for treatment.   Traumafocussed CBT is the gold standard treatment for PTSD.  Counselling is far cheaper but does not treat PTSD and can easily make it worse if you allow someone to dig up the bad memories when they dont have the skills and time available to do the memory reprocessing work with you.There is no medicine for PTSD but meds can help a great deal with anxiety and depression.  CBT is good for them both too.  Often you start with meds to get you into shape to do the CBT then hopefully drop or reduce the meds once you become more adept at wrestling your mind into healthy patterns.  .  In the meantime consider these rules to stop retraumatising yourself    The association of alcohol and sex may well be a trigger.   Stop having sex when either of you have been drinking.   This will remove three possible triggers  your drunkenness her drunkenness and your worry about her  changing her mind when sober.      Stop having pumpanddump sex with women who dont love you.   It was a gamble that you lost and were hurt by.   It isnt working currently and it isnt going to work in the future either.   This is selfdestructive behaviour you are not going to be able to learn how to do it safely again.  Other people can you cant.  Just stop it.    If you dont already have some develop platonic friendships with women to help with rebuilding trust.  Try to find a proper GF.  To fix your trust it would help a lot for you to be loved.  DONT FUCK HER!!!  Explain your situation and that you are getting professional help for it. She needs to know you are going to get better.  Establish a solid base of friendship and trust keeping your clothes on.  Use the anxiety management techniques that you will be taught to cope with very gradually increasing your physical intimacy at a pace which will not trigger a panic reaction.

6931070,0,t3_4ao0id,gtMARCH   Two pieces of news affected me from the recent International Womens Day IWD. I will address both through this column in chronological order. On the th anniversary of IWD PAS Ulama boldly claim that a womans role is one that is restricted to the familys home and that women should only function as wives and mothers. gtWomen should be allowed to make our own choices  if we want to take a career break to bring up our children or have flexiworking hours we should have a system that allows us to do so. This break should not stop us from advancing in our careers nor should it make us feel that we contribute less to society. Women should also be allowed to NOT want to be wives andor mothers. Husbands should share the responsibilities of household chores and parenting with their wives. After all IWD this year calls a pledgeforparity. Women should get things. So what if she cant work  hours a week or decides to hop on the Mommy Track? She should still make partner. So what if she stays at home for  hours a day while hubby is at work making the money? He should still have to come home mentally and physically worn and be expected to vacuum wash dishes dust and take out the trash because EQUALITY!gtI suggest PAS have a long and good read of this as well as relooking at the egalitarian spirit in the Quran the Prophets teachings and early Islamic history. Equality musawah and feminism is not a western import instead it very much have its roots in Islam.....gtI do not deny that there are men who experienced sexual assault violence discrimination and sexism. These men do need all our support and systems that do not stigmatise against them. But having halfway homes for husbands? If we were to look at the latest  statistics of domestic violence provided by the Womens Ministry itself  complainants were female while  were male a ratio of . Instead of providing these spaces solely for husbands can I suggest that these homes be provided for young boys and men who are marginalised or disowned from their families due to their sexuality? Can we also have halfway homes for transgender persons? I think that these communities require more urgent help empowerment and the need for acceptance by our society. Until the gays and trannies are taken care of men should just wait their turn? Sort of like how until black people in America were taken care of white feminists should have waited their turn? Oh wait feminists didnt wait their turn. Feminists want it NOW NOW NOW.gtThe spirit of equality is the basis for celebrating IWD. It is not a day to celebrate womens sacrifices but rather a reminder that we have a long way to go to achieve equal rights afforded so easily and readily to privileged conformist men. Lest we forget sexism and violence directed against men stems from a patriarchal system that is already embedded in our society.Comrades! The revolution will never truly be won until Emanuel Goldstein I mean the Patriarchy and all its secret traitors are rooted out and destroyed.gtWMD should not be about celebrating mens sacrifices. It should be about understanding and respecting gender sexuality and the discourse on sexism. It should be a celebration of equality one that is already celebrated for  years through IWD. Thus having these two celebrations would be redundant. In our haste for inclusivity let us not lose sight of the meaning behind the struggle in the first place.Mens Day shouldnt be about men. It should like all things be about WOMEN! So what if men die earlier younger and worse than women whether it is due to work stress or crime?

7020559,0,t1_d1bq3r6,Point one When was the term oppression used in my remarks? This is a term selected by you and introduced into the exchange by you. Further how I am recuperating the attack? Do you believe I care more about this discrimination than the actual deaths and injuries? By what grounds do you assume such? Are we to be prevented from challenging discrimination simply because it makes you uncomfortable that were not  talking about the attack itself? Is discrimination justified if its overshadowed by tragedy? Or is this perhaps a means of your shutting down meaningful conversation with an appeal to your feelings? You cant say that because other peoples suffering! It is a given that the victims of violent crime like this receive sympathy. It is not a given that gender and sexual egalitarianism is observed or even supported. Point two Fuck off is not an insult as it makes no attack on your character. It is a blunt expression of distaste that makes no claim regarding you but instead describes my own position. If you choose to find it insulting that is your prerogative. You may decide you are being victimized all you wish. Point three Ignoring others opinion? No. Im saying that your opinion is just that  your opinion. You dont get to defend a practice that affects multiple others by saying that youre alright with it. That has no bearing on what is being imposed upon others. Your position is perfectly fine if it only affects you  but what youre doing is justifying the imposition of your perspective on others excusing it simply because it doesnt inconvenience you personally. Its not merely you who would be made to put women first but all men  many of whom do not share your perspective. How have I ignored your perspective? I have chosen not to validate it and to call it out as selfish for failing to take into account that your personal tolerances have no bearing on what is forced upon others. This is not ignoring it. It is judging it. Are you to be immune from judgement? Once again the common thread here is that your feelings may not be challenged you can declare a blanket safe space in which policy and societal attitudes must be left unmolested because of some nebulous idea that it isnt right  because one assumes it challenges your emotional security.Point four I suspect is not making stuff up but airing a suspicion. I suspect is not It is an undeniable fact that.... It is my suspicion. Sniff sniff. What is that I smell? The smug tactics of a feministesque crybully? Why yes it is!And if you think the women and children thing isnt a real concern...I hear that phrase in the mainstream media frequently.

The only way this graph can possibly be considered correct is if not only a yaxis has been removed but a zaxis too and that is not how to display data. On the other hand the graph in this thread has a very clear scale on the yaxis which only applies to one set of data. This is better for a number of reasons but more importantly would be accepted as the correct way or at least a correct way of displaying the data by the scientific community. It is incorrect to assume the yaxis must start at  in all circumstances but it is also absolutely necessary to label your axes when it doesnt  and I would dare say even when it does  theres not really any excuse for not labelling an axis other than trying to manipulate data  not labelling axes at all is an idiotic approach and one that I would only expect from someone stupid enough to want to close planned parenthoods for their own agenda.,MensRights,d1e386x,1,t5_2qhk3

Language develops and words in course of time depart widely from their original connotation so that etymology alone is seldom of much value in practically determining the definition of words in their application at the present day. But the fact is none the less worthy of note that only a fragment of the original connotation of the word chivalry is covered by the term as used in our time and that even that fragment is torn from its original connection and is made to serve as a scarecrow in the field of public opinion to intimidate all who refuse to act upon or who protest against the privileges and immunities of the female sex.gt I have said that even that subsidiary element in the old original notion of chivalry which is now wellnigh the only surviving remnant of its original connotation is torn from its connection and hence has necessarily become radically changed in its meaning. From being part of a general code of manners enjoined upon a particular guild or profession it has been degraded to mean the exclusive right in one sex guaranteed by law and custom to certain advantages and exemptions without any corresponding responsibility. Let us make no mistake about this. When the limelight of a little plain but critical commonsense is turned upon this notion of chivalry hitherto regarded as so sacrosanct it is seen to be but a poor thing after all and when men have acquired the habit of habitually turning the light of such criticism upon it the accusation so terrible in the present state of public opinion of being unchivalrous will lose its terrors for them. In the socalled ages of chivalry themselves it never meant as it does today the woman right or wrong. It never meant as it does today the general legal and social privilege of sex. It never meant a social defence or a legal exoneration for the bad and even the criminal woman simply because she is a woman. It meant none of these things.,MensRights,d1fu7n9,3,t5_2qhk3

I see men every day being discredited for simply be a male. I continuously hear women talking about how they want to force their husbands boyfriends and male coworkers into sensitivity training. Women have this idea that its their main mission to find a mate they can change to be exactly how they want them to be. The word rape has evolved of the past century to simply being no means no to what it is today. Rape has become a tool for the extremists loudest of the feminist movement to degrade and castrate any male that defends themselves. We are starting to see today that the word rape still holds dire punishments but society is so tired of trying to actually convict someone beyond reasonable doubt they instead convict them in the premise of social justice. In many cases you see men found not guilty but due to social justice they still get punished as if they are guilty. Their lives get destroyed families torn apart career torn up and credibility tarnished. We are now seeing women claiming rape when in reality they didnt get what they wanted so that used the best way to punish a man by claiming rape of some form.

Filling out your twitter profile bio and following some users makes your account seem more genuine and makes it more likely that your tweets will show up in the hashtag search. Also send out another CallItRape tweet a few days after creating your accountFrom BlackLivesMatter to TheTriggering hashtag activism has been very effective at raising awareness of many other issues for many other causes. When it comes to the fact that rape statistics only include male victims who have been sodomized lack of awareness is the primary issue. Very few people are aware of this problem but most find it hard to oppose MRAs on this issue once theyre made aware of it. Academic feminists mostly bury this in their footnotes rarely do they openly acknowledge what theyre doing. RAINNs response to a previous email campaign by MRAs indicates that they dont really have any way to defend their position either. Once this issue gains mainstream attention I expect RAINN to change their attitude toward male rape victims and we may see the CDC BJS and academics feel pressure to do the samePrevious email campaigns by rmensrights have been successful at getting a response from RAINN and the CDC but those responses werent public so it didnt raise much awareness. If as many people participate in this as we had with the email campaigns we can raise a lot of awareness and hopefully get a public statement from RAINN the CDC andor the BJS on why they dont consider it rape when women force men to have sex. Here is the AVFM article about it remove the dollar signs... those are there because AVFM is blocked on redditEDIT As a side note MRAs really need to be more involved on Twitter in general.

Are the drug addicts cruelly forcing people to produce and sell drugs against their will?If prostitution is illegal both participants should be punished equally.

My view is simple you are procircumcision if your position is that its up to research and science to prove that MGM is damaging overall to males rather than starting from the morally and scientifically correct position that MGM is inherently immoral and that science has to prove that amputating the foreskin confers overall benefits that manage to outweigh the terrible damage it does.And consider this Its the law in many countries that even a needleprick to an infant girls clitoral hood is genital mutilation and a very serious criminal offence. There is no debate about that and try and publish a scientific paper that says otherwise!The AAP tried that angle and they got shot down big time and had to backpedal fastAAP Retracts Controversial Policy on Female Genital CuttingYou can see a little girl suffering such genital mutilation here it lasts about  seconds at the start of the video. A fresh and antiseptic needle is usedCompare that to this  which is legal worldwide and scientifically debatable and needs research in peer reviewed journals before we decide if its OK or notAnd try this for sizeNSFL Warning! Horrific photo collection from a Dutch doctor of hundreds of mutilated amputated and seriously infected penises many with gangrene of African boys and men as a result of male circumcision  ie sexual abuse and genital mutilation. This is just one tiny area of Africa  where MGM is widespread. Most of these men will have their penis amputated and many will die or commit suicideAnd of course they have recently started penile transplants in South Africa due to the thousands of boys that have their penises amputated each year.Try getting a grant from a western government or the UN to campaign against that.Sorry.

I note this sentence Moreover procedures like clitoridectomy and normal ovariotomy even in the days of their greatest acceptance were performed on a small minority of American women. Yet circumcision quietly democratized in the last decade of the nineteenth century was subsequently extended to a majority of the male population.But FGM was widespread in Africa and many other parts of the world and when this became common knowledge and raised into the modern public consciousness in the late s and early s it was as I have stated never seriously debated in the west as something that could be acceptable for medical health cultural or religious reasons.Instead the full force international organisations and western political and human rights groups was brought to bear on itBut MGM in Africa and the rest of the world?

White males historically had it better. Whatever. But its getting to the point now white hetereosexual cis men are unable to tackle their own mental and emotional issues because they have nothing to complain about. Women nonhetereosexuals people of color ect have had the stand as victims for so long theyre unable to comprehend a white man can be a victim. I used to be one of those obnoxious tumblrinas who drank male tears and joked about misandry. But then after a while I woke the fuck up. This is doing to an entire class of victims that happened to minorities and women for AGES. By scoffing at straight white males and laughing at them were silencing an entire set of victims andor survivors. Were still in a society where many feel that men need to suck it up and deal with their problems alone. That men cant cry or have feelings. That men are strong of mind and rational  of the time. But the reality is the male and female brains arent that different. Men are just as capable of having emotional breakdowns. The difference is how socially acceptable is for a man to just break down crying around others.As I said Im still a feminist. But Ive strayed away from the main stream shit. You dont tear people down to get ahead. A man who was raped or abused deserves just as much attention care and support as a female. If not a bit more in the current state of things. I say this not because I want to say their experiences are worse because theyre male. I say it because there is less support for male victims. ,MensRights,d284sz1,7,t5_2qhk3

7421890,0,t1_d2lrj54,I hear what youre saying and it makes sense. But think about this for a second. If rape involves sexual intercourse well what is sexual intercourse? Legally its defined as some sort of penetration anal oral or vaginal by a tongue a finger a dick or an inanimate object. Weve established that the person doing the penetration isnt necessarily the perpetrator guys can get raped too and having a hard on doesnt mean he wanted it. Given that lets assume a sexual motivation is involved. Mr X gets his jollies off by violating a persons sexuality. Mr X tackles finds a drunk woman gives her a roofie colada and crams a dildo up her junk once shes completely incapacitated. Thats rape hands down.Mr. X finds uses a similarly drunk guy gives him the same roofies as soon as that guy is suitably incapacitated Mr X puts some alienlooking PV  on the guys dick and youre going to tell me that kind of scene isnt rape because no vagina ass or mouth was penetrated? Thats horse shit and I think you know it. Just the same chopping off someones dick is rape. Yeah that kind of crime is also a slew of other things but that doesnt exclude rape from the equation somehow. The whole thing boils down to nothing more than motive and denying someone elses capacity to exercise sexual agency. The legal definitions as they stand belong on the short bus. The penetration standard means molesting a guy in his sleep with a jailhouse Fifi isnt rape and I think you know better than that. ,MensRights,d2ltjs6,-1,t5_2qhk3

You cant weasel out of that.gtit is this reasoning which has informed all sexual harassment and assaultrape reform for the last  yearsStill appeal to tradition?gtIf you ask if she wants to do something later and after she says no you dont stop thats harassment. Simply asking is not unless you want to live in a society where people read men are not allowed to ask others to be more intimate for fear of being accused of harassment.Go up to a coworker and ask them for sex flat out then.gtHence clarification. Are you this retarded?Im sorry miss but around this place it is expected that you want to be groped if you rub up against a guy while dancing.gtSo its instantly rape and clarification isnt allowed right?Like I said before its an impossible Schrodingers cat situation. You think what Im saying doesnt make sense but it is the explanation of what women and laws see. You cant ask flat out thats rude and disgusting and sexual harassment. You can risk it but if shes not that type of girl then youre sexually harassing or sexually assaulting her. Maybe she just wanted to dance.She can in fact turn you in for grabbing her ass if she danced with you and then you did that and she didnt want it. Youre pressing the whole contextunspoken language thing pretty hard but nonverbal communication is just as prone to being a dialect as verbal langauge. What you think is flirting for more sexual behavior might not be to her and since it isnt to her you dont have her consent for that ass grope. Since you dont have that consent she could very reliably make a case for it.Havent you read all the stories of women complaining of being groped by guys in bars or clubs or at frat parties etc? Its about consent not about nonverbal communication. Prostitutes used to wear revealing clothing as nonverbal communication fyi. Most women would not wear that unless they wanted their social status damaged. Again clothing  nonverbal communication.Women started wanting to wear that and mens understanding of this nonverbal communication lagged behind where the women started getting upset and demanding laws change regarding sexual harassmentassault.Let me reiterate that Women started using what was widely known as nonverbal communication as being amenable to ass grabbing or even loose sex and then found their bodys violated by guys who didnt understand it.Nonverbal communication is dialectic. It evolves just like verbal language as well and quickly.What you do in response to a womans leaning into your body might be fine today and sexual harassment tomorrow based on the shifting of nonverbal language and cues meanings as well as shifting of laws etc.You think Im straw manning or making things up but this is just how it works. It is often contradictory the rules keep changing and sometimes they make little sense. Im not asserting how things SHOULD BE Im asserting how they ACTUALLY ARE.In reference to your pointgt Also what entitles her to be able to initiate contact but not him to go further in your example?Because it isnt considered sexual assault or harassment yet either socially or legally for her to initiate contact.

And the fact that for men it is seen as optional means many employers expect you to opt out like my job. I personally think we should have some sort of subsidized income for  months for BOTH the mother and father. It it was mandatory and both genders had to take it then companies wouldnt hire men over women because a woman might have a child. As a guy would equally cost the the company the same. And I think you can find strong support on both sides to get paid paternity leave. The only ones that hate it are the childless crowd.

For example they like to say things like women are just as strong as men if not stronger until it comes to something like this issue that would directly affect them.

7641597,0,t3_4jyo0v,gt many articles claim that life on the street for homeless women is far more dangerous than for homeless men. Everyone talks about how likely women are to be raped though no one seems to mention any sexual assault stats about men or the violence they might experience. I dont know what to say to the argument that its worse for women because I cant find information to the contrary.Right away Im skeptical of this argument because of how its framed as you put it. Statistics of the homeless are almost impossible to do. The government has a tough enough time just finding out how many homeless people there are let alone specifics about what happens to homeless people. I have no idea if women get raped more or not but even if they do which I actually doubt to a large extent honestly there are plenty of other issues like being assaultedbattered that likely impact men more. And how do you compare the weight of someone getting battered to someone getting raped? Is getting raped x worse? x? x? Honestly I doubt these statistics even exist on homelessness rape by gender among other issues.gt people keep claiming there are more services offered to men than women. Is there a source for this or is it based on peoples personal experiences of a specific area? I googled the shelters in my area and about  of them were for men only or single men and women and  for women only or families. Are people trying to say that there arent enough services for homeless men or that there literally are more shelters for women in existence than for men?This isnt accurate from what Ive seen. From what Ive seen men and women are sheltered about  each yet men make up  of the homeless. This is why you might have seen the stat that women make up  of the homeless because they ignore all the unaccounted people that arent in shelters to get that stat in order to make it sound like more of a womans issue than it is. I know there are a lot of womensonly shelters. Also many menonly shelters dont allow children but womenonly shelters do typically. Sometimes womenonly shelters only allow daughters and not sons. Theres a lot of sexism against men and boys in that department. Also many shelters that do allow men only do so during the winter months and during the summer months men are banned. So I dont buy that there are more shelters for men or that there are more services for men. And if there are  more shelters for men thats still less than there should be for men because men make up  of the homeless. I know there was a study in the UK a few years back that showed that  of the homeless that died were men.If youre interested in a specific studystat let me know and maybe I can try to find the source otherwise just google it and you might find the studiesstats Im talking about.,MensRights,d3at2pb,3,t5_2qhk3

7687018,0,t1_d3fwant,Ooo! Lets look!I had actually seen the second link before but it has no conclusive data.The second link mentions methods but I dont see where it explicitly states the number of attempts by either gender. Id also like to grumble at the fact that there were over three times as many women in the study than men.In the background section it states Literature data suggest that suicide attempts are more frequently undertaken by women whereas men are more often the performers of effective lethal fatal suicides  but two of the sources it lists arent academic and the third one is a study of only  subjects in Brazil. But the first link is interesting.gtIn  the agestandardized hospitalization rate for attempted suicide was  per  females aged  or older and  per  of their male counterparts. Some research has indicated that women are more likely than men to make suicide attempts that are actually intended to be nonfatal but this view remains controversial.I went down a rabbit hole and went to find one of those controversial citations.From Canetto S Sakinofsky I. The gender paradox in suicide. Suicide and Lifethreatening Behaviour   .gt Is the female predominance among those with nonfatal suicidal ideation or behavior real or an artifact? Is nonfatal suicidal behavior underreported in men? According to Whitehead Johnson and Ferrence  high rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior in females as compared to males may be an artifact of biased data collection specifically the exclusion of data on nonfatal suicidal behaviors from maledominated institutions such as jails. In Alberta Canada for example Bland Newman Dyck and Orn  found that  of  persons sentenced to correctional centers were males. Their study revealed that in correctional settings males have high rates of nonfatal suicidality. In jails and prisons in the Netherlands  of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behavior and  of suicides were males presumably reflecting a similar gender distribution in the base sample Kerkhof amp Bernasco .gt The medical seriousness of a suicidal act might not however correlate with suicidal intent. Again using the Canadian data set Sakinofsky et al.  we calculated suicidal intent scores based on the circumstances of the act using the Suicidal Intent Scale SIS Beck Beck amp Kovacs  Beck Morris amp Beck  Beck Schuyler amp Herman . The mean score for females was . SD  . and for males . SD  . n   t  . p  .. In other words females and males appeared to be equally intent on killing themselves. Finally we measured suicidal intent at the time of the index suicidal act using an ordinal scale derived from early work by Shneidman  and Kessel . When graded according to whether the act was intentionally suicidal cessation intended or subintended  the person wanted to die or did not care whether or not he or she lived . of females and . of males suicidal acts fell into this category.gt In sum in Western countries the high number of females among those who are suicidal as compared to males may be a less consistent phenomenon than previously thought. We have documented examples of localities e.g. Helsinki Finland and ethnic minorities e.g. Native Hawaiians in the United States where one finds an exception to the expected pattern. Finally we have reviewed evidence concerning the genderrelated meaning of nonfatal suicidal behavior in the United States i.e. the association of nonfatal suicidal behavior and femininity and suggested that these beliefs may lead to underreporting by and about suicidal males. We have also speculated on the role of these beliefs in creating a gender gap in rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior.So basically... Women dont significantly attempt more than men and it is a bullshit statistic due to underreporting and exclusion of certain data.,MensRights,d3fys4g,2,t5_2qhk3

7739315,1,t1_d3ltwcz,Yeah I knew the hivemind wouldnt be thrilled with that one. Your comment is so assbackwards its not even funny. Heres why.gt Very eloquently put but Im not sure how you inferred any of that from the comic. Theres nothing to indicate he didnt want marriage or kids just that his wife pushed for it. Furthermore wheres the blame for forcing him to get married and have kids?Ill start by saying I read the comic thoroughly not selectively. In fact I seem to be reading too much into the matter as Ok doesnt seem quite like the response of someone whos stoked about having a wife and kids. The entire premise here is that the whole principle of marriage in the st Century see title of comic is a circling drain of shit that no man should ever want because it will only lead to misery.gt Well Im not really surprised that you rationalized cheating you must be a horrible partner. You can divorce someone if you dont want to be married but theres no excuse to cheat on your partner ever. All youre doing is trying to shift blame away from the cheater. Considering your first paragraph if you were capable of organizing your thoughts is all about the evils of shifting blame this is a tad hypocritical. Did you just make yourself as you so eloquently put look like a bitch?How did I rationalize cheating? That literally didnt happen. Healthy relationships dont result in cheating or divorce. Im not shifting blame away from the cheater. The fact is in cases like this as the comic illustrates cheating results from deeper running issues that can be attributed to either or both sides. Once cheating has happened or a divorce is in place those become their own issues that need to be dealt with accordingly. That is a fact. That doesnt make cheating any less unacceptable. Blame has nothing to do with it its about dealing with those underlying problems before it reaches this point. And Im a horrible partner? What an insult from someone I actually have to explain this to. Nothing hypocritical. Good couples ask themselves and each other what can I do to make this relationship better for both of us?gt Lol wut? Cheating can be easily avoided dont fucking cheat.Lol no shit. I can help cheating. Ive never even wanted to commit an infidelity. But people get cheated on and divorced from. Youre telling me not to victim blame but Im just saying its the task of both people to keep the relationship healthy. Its like youre telling the person who was cheated on not to cheat.gt Yes because if a man marries a person he loves and has kids its definitely his fault for getting cheated on divorced and alienated from his kids. sSee my first point in this reply. Youll find Im not the one selectively reading.gt You must have very selectively read this comic and have a very misinformed outlook on how family law works in the US if you have that impression.Im a child of divorced parentsfirst. Secondly  Im not going around telling people if you get married you might as well kill yourself because youre going to end up lonely and broke and suicidal anyway. Thats not empowerment.gt Just like when rape victims are friends with their attacker are drunk and are wearing a skimpy outfit right? Theyre just victimizing themselves when other people do horrible things to them that are wholly out of their control. sYoure comparing a persons role in a relationship to being a victim of rape. Seriously think about that for a minute. Real nice. No yeah my view of relationships is unhealthy. Youre right. I have no clue what Im talking about.gt This comic doesnt mention male empowerment the MRM or anything like that it highlights a terrible reality that many men face thats it and ends with the guy contemplating suicide.Ok if you submit to reddits MRA community that the world is inherently shittier for you because youre a man youre literally doing the same thing neofeminists do. Its like those douchebags who treat girls like crap so they feel like theyre not good enough to leave and be happy on their own.gt Theres a big difference between a feminist telling a woman in a first world country that shes oppressed and a comic that shows a very real situation of men getting fucked over by the institution of marriage.Yeah I didnt mean ACTUAL feminism excuse me.

The tendency to be believed and protected when accusing someone of a crime or being accused of a crime.  The ability to support the lifestyle you want through alimony and marriage fraud of multiple men.  The ability to attack a man and have a reasonable expectation of not being attacked back after all you NEVER hit a woman. The right to influence government through voting but not having the same expectation of the threat of being drafted hanging over your head. Even if you were drafted theres no way you would ever be forced into a combat role.  and even if you were you could just suddenly become pregnant accidentally and not be deployed and face little to no repercussions. Also you never EVER accidentally become a parent. So many forms of birth control and contraception exist that it is IMPOSSIBLE for a woman unless physically forced to do so to carry a child to term that she does not wish to have. Even if you carry a child to term but dont wish to be a parent you can abandon the little bastard at a fire station not be prosecuted charged or face anything worse than social repercussions for being a terrible human being. You can fight against systems of oppression against you whether real or false and not be considered the second coming of Hitler. No matter what time in your life no matter what the circumstances if youre in civil society you will always always always have someplace to go.

Neither I nor no one else I know ever cared to do more out of anything but vanity Im not a updo person.Yeah and when my hair was long it was a nightmare. I might as well have been Cousin Itt. If it was hanging loose my vision was impaired. It couldnt even be reliably tied back for more than a couple hours of moderate activity without slipping free and tying it back gave me headaches. I had to wash it every couple days just as I do now due to oily scalp but now I dont need to even bring a comb when I travel.

8011319,0,t1_d4gegjg,I wasnt making a comparison between this case and the epidemic of Catholic priestchildmolesters. I was merely citing it as an example of how victims can be pressured to stay silent to such an extent that rapists get away with their crimes over and over and over again. If youre skeptical of that I think youre failing to consider just how traumatic being raped is and how difficult trauma is to deal with. Most victims just want to forget the entire thing happened and try to live out the rest of their lives as though it didnt. Pressing charges and going through a lengthy trialparticularly shortly after the rape happened when the trauma is rawestis almost always the last thing they want to do and frequently arent psychologically capable of doing. Thats why the statutes of limitations on rape are as long as they are and while there are certainly complications with those statutes that have gone unaddressed that doesnt change the fact that there are still good reasons for them.As for the Catholic priest thing I happen to be a therapist and your assertion that priests celibacy is the cause of their sadistic behavior is actually longdebunked popular misconception. We dont precisely know why so many priests have committed this particular type of crime but the running theory at the moment is that the position of priest is one that is particularly attractive for pedophiles because of the access it provides to children and the veil of modestypurity it lends as a shield against accusations. In other words its not that theres something about being a priest that encourages pedophilia its that the occupation serves pedophiles goals particularly well and thus many pedophiles become priests. If there was something about celibacy that encouraged pedophilia or even just sexual deviancy wed see those effects far more pervasively than we do. The fact that there are plenty of priestsand celibate people in generalwho do not go around sexually abusing people is proof that its not the celibacy thats the problem. ,MensRights,d4gjp2d,-6,t5_2qhk3

8110728,0,t1_d4rn8bu,No I never said that.  Ive been arguing that selfselection doesnt mean what you think it does. Youre trying to use a strong study result to infer that it must be a result of selfselection but thats begging the question.  Youre really suggesting that even without a paternity test that men have a surefire way of knowing whether or not theyve been duped into parenthood.  They dont actually have a good way of knowing.  And so even a  cheat rate would be a good enough reason for all men to be suspicious.  Let alone a  rate.This whole issue here is that you dont seem know how selfselection works.  Lets consider the feminist surveys on rape.  On the one hand you have women who know they had been brutally forcibly raped plus the women who believe it in their heads that they were raped because they regretted a one night stand all selfselecting themselves and skewing the crap out of the survey.  But on the other hand you also have the exceeding vast majority of women who know that they werent raped selecting themselves out of the survey.  When you have people who cleanly fall into one of two categories and they already know which group they belong to beforehand self selection can skew the data to look like  in  even when the real rates are more like  in .Compare this to the way selfselection works for paternity fraud in Detroit and its a whole other story.   What you have are a lot of incredibly unstable relationships with most births happening out of wedlock.  You dont have two binary groups who each knows for a fact that they are either fathers or not fathers.  That is what paternity tests are for thats why people take the tests.  Because they dont know.  And for every man who takes the test because he really does know for sure its offset by the men who take the test because they are convinced but flat out wrong.  Unlike in the feminist rape survey where these numbers would just get tallied up to skew the results even more here they cancel each other out because theres an actual test involved.  It could even have the opposite effect with men who truly know theyre not the father skipping the test. while men who falsely believe they were duped flocking to it.So if you were conducting a survey of defrauded men and everyone had already taken paternity tests then you would see the kind of selfselection bias that you do on a rape survey.  But thats not what you have.  So the selfselection bias may not be as strong.  ,MensRights,d4rpw4c,0,t5_2qhk3

8122135,0,t3_4qejpk,I keep seeing this but its not truegt The reason men get paid more is because women choose to work less than men choose less dirty antisocial difficult and dangerous jobs. Simply it is down to womens choices.Polling says that most people of either sex would rather work less if they could.  Duh.  Women do this more than men because women have more power and can afford to work less.  Having choices is power.  Its not really that women make choices its more that men mostly feel they cant.  Men mostly feel they have to earn more and this is because they are discriminated against by society in pressuring them to earn more.So yes the earnings gap is due to sexism  against men.MRAs need to turn this myth around.Useful factoids here are other ways in which wage gap actually tracks privilege of the groups who dont have to work. Lesbians earn more than straight women. Black women earn more than white if you take into account education level Wage gap is biggest in developed countries and smallest in poor countries because third world women often have to work hard like a man.So unless you think lesbians are privileged over straight women black women are privileged over white women and women in the third world are privileged over women in developed countries maybe we should start pointing out that the wage gap shows who has privilege by the fact that they are the ones who have to earn the least??Earning money isnt power.

In practice I have a hard time believing there are enough feminists who are willing to look past their own ideology and take the time to learn about the MRM. Websites like We Hunted The Mammoth exist for the sole purpose to attack and mock MRAs and the MRM for feminists. It isnt alone either. At least as it manifests online most feminists are incredibly hostile to the mere notion of mens rights. Just consider the outrage expressed at Kit Harington when he said he was treated like a sex object on Game of Thrones.Consider your own beliefs in feminism and how they have changed over time. If you werent already educated what would you think of the MRM and MRAs? Probably that its sexist and that theyre sexist. Thats all the messaging you ever hear. And not to say that there is no sexism and there are no sexists. There is and there are and thats unfortunate.At the same time Id expect many MRAs to be gunshy and mistrusting of feminists who say theyre here to help because they are accustomed to being undermined and attacked at every turn.I think you might have better luck convincing fellow egalitarians to shift their focus to include or be specifically for mens issues and not just womens issues gay rights etc.,MensRights,d52oqup,1,t5_2qhk3

8316654,0,t1_d5gep4l,There is a valuable distinction. We expect suicide to be more common in those with depression anxiety schizophrenia OCD PTSD etc. Even if there is no diagnosis by a mental health practitioner family and friends would hopefully be able to spot odd or maladaptive behavior before the suicide. The mental illness seems to drive the suicide and progresses in intensity until the patient attempts suicide and then either succeeds or fails. Its far more insidious if someone with no history of diagnosed mental illness and who showed no signssymptoms of mental illness commits suicide. Why the hell would he do something like that? There are no guarantees that you would find odd behavior before the suicide. It might have come out of the blue. It means that from a public health perspective some people will kill themselves for seemingly no reason or lose their coping skills all of the sudden. How can we recognize who will do this and prevent this? Maybe there are some commonalities in men who commit suicide with no prior history of mental illness compared to those who commit suicide who do have a history of mental illness. ,MensRights,d5h4zgp,1,t5_2qhk3

True victims of both genders are more likely to suffer silently. Therefore they wrote laws to make it easier to report them which doesnt actually make these victims more likely to report but rather opens the door to abuse of the system by either false accusation or the abuser accusing the abused.The standard law enforcement approach becomes ineffective here. Policing should involve mediation between the parties instead of just arrest. That would help police determine whether abuse was committed and who was at fault.

8501003,0,t3_4w3azv,This ruling a big deal!  This makes it MUCH easier for young men caught up in the campussex witch hunt to pursue claims in federal court. The ruling is immediately effective within the second federal circuit NY VT and CT but the second circuit is highly influential so this is likely to be adopted in other places as well.Heres what its about. A plaintiff initiates a lawsuit by filing a complaint which includes a statement of alleged facts. Ordinarily the defendant then files an answer responding to the complaint and the case proceeds on to discovery. However before filing an answer the defendant can file a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a b motion. The trial court in this case granted such a motion thereby dismissing the plaintiffs case. The court of appeals has overturned that dismissal reinstituting the lawsuit and in doing so defined a much narrower legal rule for when future b dismissal motions will be granted in similar cases. This means that this plaintiffs suit against Columbia University can continue and that other plaintiffs are not likely to have their cases dismissed.In a b motion the defendant argues that even if all of the nonconclusory facts in the complaint are true the plaintiff still loses. This plaintiffs claim is that he was discriminated against due to being male which both the trial court and the appellate court agree would constitute a valid claim if it were proven. The plaintiffs complaint sought to show discrimination by pointing to a bunch of things the university did against him and saying that these were done because he is male. The trial courts dismissal hinged on viewing the becauseheismale aspect as a conclusion rather than a fact. Basically the trial court dismissed the case because the plaintiff hadnt pointed to any smoking gun.The appellate court reversed the dismissal holding that allegation of facts supporting a minimal plausible inference of discriminatory intent suffices. In other words to make it past the b stage the plaintiff doesnt need a smoking gun he just needs to be able to tell a story that if believed makes it sound plausible that he was discriminated against.So why is this important? Because clearing the b hurdle is one of the absolute most important moments in civil litigation. After that point the case moves to the discovery phase where the plaintiff has powers to compel the university to provide information. Court procedures assume that plaintiffs probably do not have all of the evidence they need at the start of the case but they are able to gather more during discovery. The plaintiff will be able to depose witnesses force the university to turn over documents and give sworn answers to interrogatories.Universities can no longer shut these cases down but will have to reckon with them.Kudos to the plaintiff and his lawyers on this victory!,MensRights,d646f5n,12,t5_2qhk3

There is a social norm that a man doesnt hit a woman and I have to put that social norm aside. It might work in the favour of the defendant because it might be that he felt some embarrassment of what occurred inside Finnegans nightclub because he is a man and he was taken down by a woman.So the frightening thing is that they do take gender into account so often.

It is the most confusing aspect of sex that there can possibly be a disagreement over whether consent was given.And all of the confusion stems around the fact that some people play hard to get e.g. really do want something but playfully say they dont some people dont explicitly state their consent so as to not ruin the mood some people feel like there will be consequences if they deny consent so body language initially suggests yes and lack of withdrawn consent would suggest to one person that consent is given etc.,MensRights,d6ooud8,0,t5_2qhk3

8734995,0,t3_4zm074,Jane Gilmore is crazy.  I wrote a critique of an earlier piece so this latest one doesnt surprise me at all.I posted the following to this latest pieceAnd after articles like this why is it any surprise that men and especially MRAs some of whom are female should be angry at feminists?  Gilmores logic is as ever poor.  The premise of this article is guilt by association with an implicit no true Scotsman fallacy.Yes there are some crazy angry misogynist MRAs out there.  But MRAs hardly have the monopoly on vile and violent sexism many feminists are just as crazy angry and misandrist Yet somehow the worst extremists of feminism are a minority and not representative of all true or good feminists while at the same time extremist MRAs typify all MRAs?  Gilmores primary problem is confirmation bias.  She simply cannot accept evidence that contradicts her ideological perspective and when she cant ignore it she reinterprets such evidence through her ideological lens so to prove her prejudice.MRAs have been attempting to do all the positive things Gilmore describes for years but the examples of feminists doing their level best to obstruct and interfere with those efforts are seemingly endless.  Since Gilmore holds DV up as an example of MRAs ignominy the policy and philosophy of organisations like Our Watch White Ribbon Australia Dads in Distress and DVConnects Mensline which you can find on their websites andor in their annual reports  and also state governments  is that men are rarely innocent victims of DV that when men experience DV they are in some way culpable for it and indeed are much more likely than their female partners to be using a number of repeated patterned forms of violence to dominate and control over time.  Thats VIC state official guidance BTW.  See p. Family Violence Risk Assessment and Risk Management Framework VIC Dept. Human Services .DV Connects Menslines primarily objective is to use every opportunity to work with individual men whose actions create an environment of fear for their partners and children. Our resolve is to highlight the impact of abusive behaviours challenge those who use violence to take responsibility for their actions and encouraging them to contact services to help them change.  p. DV Connect Annual Report Even Dads in Distress Services presume guilt on the part of the help seeker We encourage men to take responsibility for their actions or inaction.   Rather than denigrate and blame women or the system or society we encourage men to look in the mirror to understand and accept their contribution to the breakdown of their family.Gilmore misrepresented DV stats in her last piece on the subject and I pointed the many flaws in that piece including that she ignores data that show the extent to which men are genuine victims of unprovoked DV.  I also pointed out that because men have nowhere to turn to thanks to such policies and philosophies outlined above men have to grin and bear it.  To man up.  When they cant take it any longer they either become perpetrators themselves or kill themselves.  Either way they end up in the very statistics Gilmore bemoans DV or suicide.Gilmore dishonestly misrepresents or is ignorant of the many opeds published by men and women alike by nonMRA but honest reporters and MRAs alike.  I can name a few off the top of my head Corine Barraclough Nina Funnell Cathy Young Barbara Kay and Erin Pizzey.  Its not so odd that theyre all women.  Men who stand up for men rarely get published in mainstream press and when they do they get castigated as misogynists and rape apologists because to dare to oppose feminism is to be presumed to antiwoman  a lie reinforced by Gilmore in this very piece.  They are therefore relegated to the more obscure websites run by MRAs themselves all of whom are grass roots activists which are then conveniently called dens of misogyny while out of the other side of their mouths detractors like Gilmore criticise men for not doing more to highlight the issues men face.When as occasionally happens MRAs manage to get the money together to hold a conference or more often antifeminist speakers some of whom are women or gay! are invited to speak on university campuses they are blockaded protested and shut down by various illegal means including pulling fire alarms.  You can find many such examples on Youtube.As for Coronial inquiries yes there have been demands such as those by Canadian Earl Silverman as to why provincial and national governments continued to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights in respect of funding for DV shelters inter alia but strangely they go unheeded.  Could it be that governments like most news publications are too afraid of the inevitable feminist backlash and dont want to spend the money anyway?  As for the suggestion that men dont give up careers and time to volunteer for their cause shes delusional.

8759005,0,t1_d70335v,I dont know how old you are but Im . I feel like Im in a transitioning period where in the past it was fuck women and now its fuck men.But theres far too many factors to take into consideration fr this to be true. Back in the day was fuck women but men died in war were expected to work themselves to death in minesmillsfields. Well back in the day childbirth was no mean feat and it wasnt like today where its  or maybe  if youre feeling frisky. My dads mum was  of nine. Her dad was one of . This was when death in childbirth was a REAL concern. Women didnt have to work themselves to death at work they were risking their lives giving birth. Lots. not only that but my family has a history of men leaving their families. seriously Ive been talking to family members about this stuff recently and both my grandfathers walked out and my parents grandfathers did the same on both sides. As a woman raising a family without a man or breadwinner it was fucking hard. My mother who now has a degree started trying for it when she was  and has a very comfortable life Her dad walked out on her mum when she was pregnant with her. She never had shoes when she was a child. Like lived in Dovecot in Liverpool and never had shoes. Imagine that really stop and think about that for a moment. It seems like third world shit but it wasnt that long ago figuratively. Thats only one generation ago. Go back a generation further when my dads grandfather walked out. Went to WW a loving and doting father returned a monster by all accounts. Now the hurt and pain that he would have endured with absolutely no help and no kind of support afterwards must have been fucking unbearable. I dont blame him at all. I cant blame him because theres no way I can be in that same situation today. But when he left he left behind a family. Lots of family. In a time before there was state help of any kind. His wife had to drag up whatever children had survived  pregnancies on her own without any kind of state help. I was a single parent after I divorced my exwife and it was hard.  daughter and  son. And i didnt know if I was doing it right or wrong all I could do was hope I was doing it right and keep on doing what I thought was right one day at a time. Compare that with what  generations back had to do and fuck me I had it easy. I cant say that Id be able to do that. I really cant. I think what Im trying to say is this. It wasnt fuck women in the past and fuck men now. It was fuck everyone in the past. Everyone had it fucking hard and not so long ago either. Now we have it comparatively easy. it could be easier it could always be easier but we seem to want to apportion blame on why its hard on someone in particular. Its easy to say that men have it hard because of women or that women have it hard because of men but thats bollocks in the grand scheme of things. There is no institutional sexism nowadays like it or not. Men can chose to be stay at home fathers women can be hard hitting power players if they chose to be. But a statement like As long as Ive been alive its been fuck men. is so disingenuous that it sounds like youre  and have no idea what youre talking about.,MensRights,d70jadc,21,t5_2qhk3

8772539,0,t3_507jm6,I feel like there is a decent compromise for everybody that can be made.         Yes it IS bullshit that a girl can swear she will get an abortion if the birth controls fails it isnt perfect and then change her mind and hit you with child support.  Maybe she even truly means it and isnt scamming on you but changes her mind.         On the other hand lets be fair to women... the financial abortion onesided termination of parental rights and responsibilities is also potentially bullshit.  Imagine if a girl is strongly prolife the guy assures he that if birth control fails he will be a father to the child then the birth control fails and he scrams.           In the first case the guy might not have consented to sex if he knew she wouldnt get an abortion.  In the second case the girl might not have consented to sex if the knew the guy wouldnt be a father.          The fair solution is a contract to opt out of parent rights  responsibilities but ONLY preemptively.  That way you both know what you are getting into and can make adult decisions about whether you consent to that or not.        So if a guy sleeps with a girl without one then he knows he is on the line as a parent ideally one night stands would have an implied version of this contract but what was or wasnt a one night stand might be pragmatically difficult to prove.  And if a girl sleeps with a guy without one and the birth control fails she better be ready to have an abortion or raise the kid on her own.         Of course people bring up the welfare of the child.  In fact in crazy situations like where the woman gave the dude a blowjob and then knocked herself up with a syringe or some shit or the boy who was statutory raped and still had to pay child support people say that the welfare of the child is the most important part so that should override anything.           But to me that line of thinking would also say that if the father dies a random dude be chosen off the street to be the father.  After all the childs welfare is such that being unfair to the father doesnt matter right?         If a child doesnt have its needs met for whatever reason then the state should step in.,MensRights,d728f84,1,t5_2qhk3

So is his name on the birth certificate andor depending on the State did he sign an affidavit of paternity?  We just dont know.  Nope no out of court agreement is going to be binding without first establishing paternity.  Mommy has baby daddy is maybe.  Thats how it works when you are unmarried.  Legally establishing paternity by one route or another is step one.  Edit  Mommy could theoretically make an agreement with a random stranger.  Use it to later cut daddy out of the picture.

8785253,0,t1_d73qmvq,Heres my pet policy idea Ive been working on assuming abortions are legal for the first trimester. If there is no proven ongoing relationship prior to conception and during pregnancy together with paternity itself and it is not proven that the man was told about the pregnancy a man cannot be liable for child support. If the man is not liable under . there is a reasonable argument for and there should be a governmentfunded child support replacement payment. If the man is otherwise liable under . he can perform a male abortion during the first two months of the pregnancy by providing a written notice filed with a government agency and served on the woman disclaiming all parental responsibility. The woman can then elect in the remaining month to abort or not but she will not be eligible for the government payment if service of a notice is proven and it can be proven by the man that the relationship ended at around the same time i.e. she chose to go it alone. If he does not exercise the right at . he loses the opportunity to abort just as the woman does at the end of the first trimester. . Burdens of proof will be the civil burden on the balance of probabilities and service of the notice could be effected by the government department to minimise any abuse of the system.

8787528,0,t1_d73rpas,No they arent and I challenge you to pull a direct quote saying that men should be able to force women to have abortions.The only thing being posited here is that women with their  birth control options and full bodily autonomy coupled with a far stronger ability to say no when a woman says no its rape when a man says no hes just trying to get attention take responsibility for their choices. Only thing on this thread so far is for women to take equal responsibility for the fact that they were part of the consensual act of sex which resulted in unwanted pregnancy.If a man does not want to be financial responsible and the woman still wants to have the child then she should carry it to term. What she shouldnt do is expect the man to sit there and pay for her choice to have a child. Especially if she knows she cannot support that child. If women are equal to men then they need to have equal responsibility in realizing whether or not they have the means to support a child before they decide to engage in sexual activity.,MensRights,d7444ws,1,t5_2qhk3

Even better Ask for a copy of the text because you and your friends want to take it together and you want to practice it. Then modify the content like this I solemly pledge to never ever hurt a woman despite the fact that no similar pledge is required from girls and thus this institution is encouraging intimate partner violence and discrimination on the basis of gender. I pledge to get the shit beat out of me by any woman who gets it in her head to  punish me and take it like a real man because that is what society demands in exchange for the priviledge society claims I have. I pledge to treat women like infantile children throwing a temper tantrum no matter how much more training or fighting experience they might have and no matter how bad a shape I may be in because a man is by default more capable of fighting then a woman ever could be. I pledge never ever to view women as my equals because if my equal can assault me and a pledge forbids me from retaliating in kind they are not my equals no matter what society tells me. I pledge to recognise my status as a worthless hull of a human being replacable and not afforded the same protection under any institution because we are denied equal representation and protection because we are supposed to be able to take it. I pledge to not resist sexual partner violence rape brutal assault OR bullying schoolyard beatings and student assault as long as the perpretrator is female. Because we as men are able to controll our violent natures with a pledge while women can not. I pledge to demonstrate this now and every day following this for as long as this institution does not require a similar pledge from its female students. Then get a girl who is in on the joke to straight up punch you in a row. Just take it. Then go to your teachers and ask them to sign that your pledge for today is fullfilled. If they call you to the principals office go there sit there quietly dont raise a fuss but demand your parents are present. Then ask them to explain why this was not exactly what they had intended and what their problem with this was. If they so much as mention no fighting on school grounds switch on your recorders smartphones and whatnots and ask them to please for the record verify that they will add a similar pledge for females including a set date or if they are ok with the local newspaper standing out in front of the school when the boys will repeat their pledge off of schoolgrounds with a similar ending and if they would like a reporter to come in and quote the principal on his or her views on gender equality including the person whose idea the pledge was. I can promise you one thing. Properly phrased they will either free the people from their pledge thus enraging the feminists or they will add a similar pledge of nonviolence against males. ,MensRights,d925tb9,4,t5_2qhk3

Acceleration due to gravity is linear but friction isnt and outside a literal vacuum has something to say about how fast you fall.However a line is a statistically close approximation for a shallow enough curve... and exponential curves approach lines by definition... at some point they become shallow enough that they  readily map to a line within a standard deviation or less. While lines are not curves sometimes theyre close enough for practical predictions.So given that they sampled attendance rates every few years going back decades... Those numbers wereFor men the decline has been seemingly linear. Oh it most likely isnt but rather a curve so shallow that a line fits it within standard acceptable variances so far as weve measured it.For women it was an obvious exponential curve but that curve has since shallowed out quite a bit as exponential curves do and forward from here a line is a reasonable approximation.This didnt provide them with ratios that they projected forward it provided them with raw numbers that they projected forward.This is key because as Im sure you realize... the ratio of two linear progressions is not itself necessarily linear.Ex  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  not linear even though its a ratio between two linear progressions namely x and y with both starting at Now their projection forward is a simplification no argument and thus technically wrong but so is everything we teach people before the doctoral level of physics any other science for certain and likely most subjects of study.At some point you have to settle for close enough with disclaimers for those like you who give a shit.,MensRights,da2gyxa,1,t5_2qhk3

What is it?I have my own pet theories Im sure everyone does increased economic and social insecurity along with not only an absolute absence of help or sympathy but actual blame i.e. boys fail at school compared to girls who are failed by schools. Many male coping techniques such as stoicism which are probably often healthy in many contexts are being undermined and pathologisted making men feel like theyre not coping or they are made wrong even when they use their preferred coping mechanisms. But at the same time taken to its extreme stoicism and selfreliance can actually be very harmful. Being able to contextualise a problem and cope with it without going to pieces is a good thing but not asking for help when youre in the mire and dont see a way out definitely isnt.But as I said these are only hunches largely based on personal experience and observations of those close to me.

Seems to me like this is some PUA trying to take advantage of a government salary or grants to get gullible migrants to sign up to his classes.I also refuse to call these people refugees this article is getting so much fucking wrong the vice president of the EU himself has said that many of these migrants dont even qualify for asylum status because they either arent actually from Syria or Afghanistan or they are migrating here purely for economic reasons.gt But across Germany hostility to asylum seekers has been on the rise since groups of foreigners  mostly young men from northern Africa  robbed and groped dozens of women on New Years Eve in Cologne.Yeah because fuck those victims right? Its not like theres been a direct link between the amount of migration from Muslim countries and the rising crime rate or anything has there? Cant imagine why the local population would be so hostile to the people who were actually responsible for these crimes.gt Violent crimes against migrants and arson attacks on asylum shelters and mosques have increased in frequency and refugees say they have experienced discrimination and abuse since the Cologne attacks.Are they fucking really? I dont dispute that there will be people getting mightily angry with these migrants and frankly for good reason but I wonder if this isnt another propaganda trick by mainstream media to paint all these migrants as helpless refugees and leaving out the fact that some of these migrants are burning down their own fucking camps and refugee centres.  Some migrants decided to burn down their own fucking centre over not having fucking chocolate and sweets.Dont even get me started on the way the Muslim migrants and economic treat other people I would class as genuine refugees like the Christians the minority Muslims and LGBT types who have had to flee these refugee centres because of their violence.TLDR Yes Im sorry bit of a rant here but this is just another in the long list of propaganda pieces that the left leaning media in particular I do not have fucking sympathy anymore especially with the fact there have been con artists trying to pass themselves off as children to enter into the UK and screwing over any real refugees that might need to come here.,MensRights,daivh0r,7,t5_2qhk3

Do I hear anything strange? Why is that man running towards me? What is making those bushes rustle?Okay.gt Author Margaret Atwood said Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.RaceGender Flip Time?Blacks are afraid whites will say something racist. Whites are afraid blacks will mug and kill them.gt You may think thats hyperbole but I promise you its not. Every woman I know has been in a situation at least once in their life when they thought their life was actually in danger.How many were in a situation where their lives were actually in danger before? How many men were in situations that were actually dangerous? How many men did you even survey? This is  feelzgtrealz so far.gt While the stories of rape and murder are the ones that gain the most media attention were aware that its unlikely to happen to us. Unlikely but always possible.gt What were more like to encounter though is sexual harassment catcalls leering suggestive comments and gesticulations  the list goes on.gt What that harassment does is remind us that we are forever vulnerable. That we can never feel truly safe.Ahh. Heres the bait and switch. Admit that actual rape and murder are very rare but heres the real issue which is that men look at us sometimes.gt A recent study conducted by Runners World found that a whopping  per cent of women sometimes experience harassment on the street when they run. Thats in contrast to the  per cent of men who experienced the same.BDMRlurker already pointed this out most men would be unlikely to consider staring harassment when a woman does it.gt Why am I telling you this? Because as a man you fall into one of two categoriesgt  Youre a genuinely nice guy who needs to be more aware of this problemgt  Youre a man who makes women feel unsafe when shes running in public shame on you!.gt Either way the fact that women feel unsafe when theyre out running in public is directly attributable to men.The fact that white people feel unsafe when theyre in the inner city is directly attributable to black people.And no Id say widespread fearmongering about how  of women are raped is a far bigger contributor to women feeling unsafe than men.gt So why are all the articles and safety tips aimed at women? Why are we gathering safety groups to run with running with personal alarms and cutting our runs short so were not out after dark?Because YOU are the one who is fucking paranoid. As pointed out in most developed countries if youre not in a crappy neighborhood the risk of being attacked is not that high. If being in a group or using a personal alarm makes you feel safer then thats an effective solution to you feeling unsafe.gt The problem is that women cant tell the difference between those problem men and the genuinely nice guys.Shrodingers Rapist strikes again. The problem is cops cant tell the difference between thugs and noncriminal black guys.gt If youre one of the good guys you probably dont think of yourself as intimidating but your presence in certain circumstances can make a woman feel unnerved. If you dont believe me ask the women you know.gt The good news is youre in a great position to help us to feel more safe when were out running. Heres what you can doFuck off. If my presence is unnerving you thats your goddamn problem.gt Dont run directly behind us at the same pace. Either overtake or fall behind.gt When youre overtaking us say something like Passing on your left. And then pass quickly.This is called common courtesy.gt Dont hang around running trails or paths wearing a hoodie and doing nothing in particular.Define running trail. IME most of them just run through normal parks. So fuck off. I have as much of a right to use a public space as you. Are you saying I cant hang out in a damn park because of your paranoia?

As I thought contradictory advice. Be friendly but not too friendly dont stop and chat but be sure to take every opportunity to be a white knight.

Normally trans people have completely fucked up hormone profiles andor are born with things like internal testicles or ovaries. Basically there are males and females and then a couple mentally ill people who would be better off getting medical treatment over being exposed to things like gender fluidity. Which have zero basis in science and cant even be quantified in a way that it could be studied. Being a biological male or female is quantifiable through chromosomes gender diamorphism hormone levels basic anatomy etc. Sure you may have the occasional Tom boy or what not that creates a spectrum. However if I look at their chromosomes and anatomy they will fall into one of two categories in every case but trans individuals. Even they have either xx or xy chromosomes there are some weird xxy combinations and stuff but are incredibly rare you could almost call it a genetic mutation. Anyways I believe in science. What can be seen weighed or basically be quantifiable in some way or another. Other wise its just guessing. You got men you got women and then you got some weird shit in between because of hormonal problems or problems with anatomy. Which is incredibly very very rare. The rest is a bunch of people on tumbler who want to feel special because mommy and daddy either didnt give them enough attention or too much turning them into a special snowflake. Seriously once otherkin became accepted as a seperate gender it went too far. Im not saying gay people and lesbians dont exist. Im saying if you look at their chromosomes or anatomy they will be either male or female. Their opinion on that is irrelevant. You can feel like a guy all day doesnt mean your period is going to stop. You can feel like a woman as a guy doesnt mean you can grow a set of tits. They are male or female. Again their opinion doesnt matter because you would then have mentally ill people deciding they are squirrels or some shit. Anatomically genetically how ever you look at it they arent a fucking squirrel no matter how bad they want to be or how convicted they are to the idea of them being a squirrel. They can believe they are a squirrel but they simply arent. ,MensRights,db1ercf,1,t5_2qhk3

Its always discussed as either a general problem or one that predominantly effects people of color.

So when an article makes special mention of how women are affected by this violence in the context of a wider array of articles that only talk about it in general or racial terms it makes it all the more glaringly apparent that men are being ignored as a demographic here despite it affecting them far more than it does women.

More people feeling more safe  more happiness  good result.For example catcalling predictably makes people feel unsafe. If a politician proposed a reasonable measure to reduce catcalling it would be a good thing to implement that measure. Reasonable is important if enforcing such a measure threatened freedom of speech in general as opposed to just freedom of catcalling it probably wouldnt be worth it.What OP said oversimplifies a complex issue and in doing so discourages action against behaviors that make people feel unsafe.,MensRights,dbd482m,2,t5_2qhk3

10084958,0,t1_dbm16up,I will hunt it down for you. It was something I found in High School back in the day when we were asked to write an essay about that era.It was a book I found in the town library with scans of the ballot cards used and the news paper articles depicting results. The only reason I took the newspaper statistic seriously as it was almost a shaming campaign for women refusing. Worded gently by todays standards but my grandparents informed me that it was quite scathing for its time.The cards themselves were your typical propaganda material of the time. From what I could gather it was a long campaign of shaming defectors as they called them trying to educate and inspire housewives using illustrated postcards with catchy slogans and just constant ballots while they simultaneously attacked the government. They didnt stop when a majority said no they just took it as a sign of more education needed and tried tried and tried again.The  though you have to remember a post card ballot is completely voluntary  so it really only measured those who cared enough about the topic to take time out of their lives to reply. I have to concede that we just dont really know what percentage of the women actually responded. Which ones voted repeatedly using friends cards etc. Still both sides of the vote could be suspected of the same thing. Some too busy to do anything  some voting repeatedly.

10113294,0,t1_dbppaan,gt since the whole detector van thing is bullshitIt might be bullshit in practice but theres perfectly good physics behind the idea and anybody can do it.  All that is needed is a highgain UHF aerial a wideband low noise RF amp and a spectrum analyser and understanding of how a superheterodyne receiver works which probably sounds a lot more complex than it really is.  Pretty much every radio for the last few decades and more before use it and the idea will have its centenary in .Super TLDR of superhet if you want frequency  MHz you tune the Local Oscillator to  MHz mix it with the antenna feed then apply a sharp filter with the desired bandwidth  MHz in the case of TVs even with digital centred around  MHz called the Intermediate Frequency or IF.  Amplify and you have your signal on a  MHz carrier regardless of what its original frequency was.Thing is no mixer is perfect and a small but readily detectable fraction of the LO power which is orders of magnitude stronger than the broadcast signal will radiate back out the antenna.  All you have to do is point your antenna at another antenna and see what LO frequencies are leaking back out which is what a spectrum analyser will tell you.Simple huh? Well not quite.  It doesnt tell you anything useful if you live in a block of flats because there will typically be one antenna with a big amplifier to send a signal to each flat.  Even if the LO signal got past the amplifier it wont you couldnt tell which flat was watching what.There are other possible techniques but theyre all much more complex and expensive.  In the days of the old CRT televisions you can reconstruct the picture the TV is displaying by collecting the RF emissions from the scanning coils see van Eck phreaking and project TEMPEST  LCDs allegedly are vulnerable to van Eck attacks although I havent read the research on how or why.  There is also some evidence based on FOIA responses that TVLA allegedly do some sort of analysis of light seen through windows but that seems pretty stupid in this day and age because amongst other factors any computer or tablet would produce the same wavelengths.LO leakage detection is a perfectly plausible way of doing it but its another question entirely as to whether TVLA actually employ this technique.  Its an equally open question as to how many of these detector vans operate either now or in the past.  I believe I read somewhere that there were only ever a few of them for the entire country and its unclear whether the BBCTVLA still regard it as cost effective.  Scare tactics are probably much cheaper and more effective and itd be enough to secure just a few convictions each year to give you something to build a scare campaign off of.I do know they make extensive use of bullying tactics and I can tell you that the TVLA was highly sceptical when I told them I didnt have a television as if no normal person did not have a TV.  Well Im not normal and anyway at the time I had only been back in the country a few months.Point is detector vans are eminently plausible and youre taking an unquantifiable risk if you choose to break the law. All that digital did was multiplex the digital frame data for each TV station together onto a  MHz supercarrier which is then broadcast on one of the old analogue TV channels.  Thats why theyre called MUXes in most areas there are about  or  MUXes of which two or three carry most of the channels of interest and another two or three are dedicated to HD. A constant carrier frequency makes signal processing at the receiver much easier and in fact this principle is required for satellite dishes to work costeffectively.  Without the LNB Low Noise Block the bunch of electronics at the focal point of the dish the microwave frequencies over which STV is transmitted would disappear into the noise floor within a few feet or less even down the best quality satellitegrade cable.  The LNB downconverts and amplifies the signal to survive the attenuation even at the intermediate frequency IF down the cable run to the receiver.,MensRights,dbprrsj,6,t5_2qhk3

One of the highest risk groups is children under  years olddrowning is the  cause of death behind car accidents.Instructing guards to pay particular attention to what the actual numbers are for at risk groups is simply smart.   Probably a GOOD step towards Mens rights to give Men MORE attention to keep them safe and make sure men are informed.    As to men dying to save other lives in a rescue attempt that falls into the bravado category but in my experience and I read up on drowning all the time the number of men dying attempting a rescue is and this is anecdotal fairly small.  I would guess less than  of all cases.  This doesnt diminish the tragedy or the fact that Men should know these risks before they make a potential life and death decision.Now if I wrote an article advocating that guards should give more attention to older men especially those who appear intoxicated and young black children one of the highest at risk groups Im not sure I would like the hate mail from Womens Rights groups.,MensRights,dbv9lu3,7,t5_2qhk3

They dont give a flying fuck about working class men or working class women for that mater in fact the struggles of working men dont even seem to enter their consciousness at all.  Theyre too busy looking up enviously at the tiny fraction of male billionaires.   How else to explain how they could come up with the idiotic notion that the sex that has spent most of history working and dying for the other is actually privileged?   No feminism is rooted in female jealousy of the honor accorded to men with high social status doctors lawyers etc as well as boredom in the gilded cage albeit a cage they could leave anytime they wanted to.   They wanted the status of professional men as well as the status of traditional women wombs plus moralizing.   This is explained well in Alison Tiemans video The Princess and the Plowhorse.   Thus feminism is rooted not in oppression but envy.   Now they want special privileges not only in the traditional female sphere but the traditional male sphere as well!   affirmative action quotas etc.    The really irritating thing about feminists like the author is that she appears to be unaware of her own movements history.

I had to sit there and listen to social services tell her that everything was gonna be ok and that they were gonna get her the help she needed so she could get custody of our son.  And when it came to me I was basically treated as the reason she was doing drugs since I had dumped her ass in the first place for being a drug addict.  Not to mention that she lied and told them that I gave her drugs while she was pregnant and beat her and abused her our entire relationship. All lies.  Even though I didnt test positive I was treated as if I had.  Having to go through all the steps and psychological evaluations even though I had no convictions for domestic violence i was treated as if I had.  My son spent the first  month of his life in foster care.  After that they released him into my custody because I passed every single drug test they gave me.  And as you have already guessed she failed every last one they gave her.  No charges were ever filed for child endangerment or child abuse.  Yet if my son were to test positive today for drugs i would be arrested thrown in jail and my parental rights terminated.

A majority of the teachers hold very Liberal political views which often include strong feminist and misandrist attitudes. Over the last decade or so nearly all of the teachers and professors with contrary views have been forced out leaving an environment with an unhealthy lack of balance in its beliefs and opinions.In coming years there will be times when your classmates friends peer group and perhaps even your teachers as well start up with a round of extreme manbashing. Dont blame them theyll just be echoing the misandry that their schooling has fed to them.But your role is important because you may be the only person there with a balanced view the only person who knows the facts. You may be the only person who can speak up in defense of men when the prevailing mood is misandry.I see some young men who come out of the education system as broken men thinking theres something wrong with them just because theyre male. They apologise and grovel when theyve done absolutely nothing wrong theyve simply been beaten down by  or  years of misandry forced upon them along with their schooling. What sort of future do those poor young men have when theyve been indoctrinated to be ashamed of who they are?Those boys  your classmates  are the ones who need your help and they need it badly. They need you to speak up when everyone else is spouting casual misandry yet again like its just a normal and accepted thing. They need to hear the other side they need to know that the lies theyre hearing about men over and over are just that lies.There may not be anything that you can do today but please just watch and listen to whats being said about men in your school and in your university in the future and speak up when necessary.

10713931,0,t1_ddkqa8w,Lets see what you said about lawsgtI would disagree. when a law is passed to explicitly protect one group or provide for one group its not equal rights for all is it. Hate crimes can apply to anyone. Protected classes protect anyone. Race being a protected class means its illegal to discriminate on race that includes white people. Gender being a protected class means its illegal to discriminate based on gender including being male.And Ill note that there are cases where that happens such as when that white kid was beat up on video those kids were charged with a hate crime.Now heres whats most wrong with what youve said. You obviously get your knickers in a bunch when other people have an opposing opinion even by how me having a civil conversation with you makes you think Im attacking you for having a different opinion. Back to my main point which is that LGBT rights are and have been about equal treatment laws related to them have been giving them equal rights.

10741739,0,t3_5to3mx,The Commonly Used Term is Glass Basement or Glass Cellar.gtWhats Worse  Glass Ceilings or Glass Cellars?  gt  gtRecently however an HBR reader introduced me to three very different terms related to gender and work Apex fallacy. Glass cellar. Feminine imperative. All of these he argued are contributing to a war on men in the workplace. This was an issue Id asked about in my essay called The Silent Sex in the March issue of HBR. The apex fallacy is the idea that we use the most visible members of a group to make generalizations about the entire group i.e. we see prominent men at the top of the pyramid and think all men are doing well when in fact there are a great many at the bottom of the pyramid too. The glass cellar refers to that lowest tier of hazardous or poorly paid jobs think firefighters truckers lumberjacks coal miners and construction workers that are mostly held by men. As National Organization for Men president Warren Farrell noted in this post of the  worst professions as determined by the Jobs Rated Almanac  have a workforce that is  or more male. And the feminine imperative is described by bloggers as the tendency for women to define social rules and morality to meet their own needs.

Second I dont see what this has to do with mens rights or this subreddit.Third it isnt sticking up for pedophiles to discuss the topic without constantly saying theyre all evil and I want to kill them all in every paragraph.Fourth and most importantly it protects children and rescues them from being molested if society would adjust their approach towards the situation. Saying fuck you I want you to die accomplishes nothing. Saying you are mentally ill and you need to get professional help before your hurt a child gets them to seek treatment.Imagine if we just said fuck you I hope you die to drug addicts and alcoholics instead of recommending that they go to rehab AA meetings drug counseling etc.  There would be more people dying from alcoholism and drug abuse. Well we do exactly that for pedos... and there are more people raping children than there would be if we sent people to get treatment instead of wishing them dead.,MensRights,ddyuo5o,3,t5_2qhk3

10850863,0,t1_ddz5tse,gtEuropean Americans...I hear that one quite a bit. Come to think of it no not really.European Americans dont have a unified culture and hence dont identify that way. I have some friends who born and live in between countries in the EU who identify as European and that in itself is a growing culture and identification. Europeans in the US can identify as IrishAmericans or Italian Americans or GermanAmericans etc based on what countryculture they identify with.African Americans in a very large part were shipped over from Africa from various countries with various cultures their culture and identification was stripped from them and they now identify as something else entirely the people that were former slaves. They identify with the culture that came along with it. Their history isnt from the empires of Mali or Egypt but from on the plantations and fighting for their rights within America. They identify as African Americans because thats something else on its own and thats the history and culture they associate with. Many dont know the African country their ancestors were shipped over from  years ago.gtKind of my point. Its not ok except when we say its ok because history.

10851715,0,t1_ddyr0la,gtgtBecause mortality rates include people who got treatment and still died.More importantly no one should have things happen to their bodies without their consent.gtSo if you get knocked out in a car accident EMS personnel shouldnt be able to save youre life?EMS treat people with implied consent meaning theyll treat you assuming thats what a reasonable person would want until they can ascertain your consent. If you become conscious you can remove your consent at that time.You can also have a do not resuscitate order which can remove your consent to treatment and if you dont have one it is assumed that you consent until proven otherwise.gtgtThe ability to live with the aid of anything in the whole world except their mother. This is usually around  weeks depending on the situation.gtBut this argument again boils down to objectifying people as nonhuman who are on any sort of life support.No it isnt. Anyone on life support could live with another machine or another person if that person decides to quitdiecease to exist. That is not the case for fetuses. That is a fundamental difference even between people in a permanent vegetative state and a fetus. And no person in a permanent vegetative state would be kept alive if another person was required to be forced to be there against their will. Hell people die on transplant lists because we cannot force people to donate part of their liver or a kidney.gtgtI didnt undervalue a fathers potential contribution. Please reread my comment then continue reading.I said that if a man contributed sperm and then just ceased to exist they could be replaced by someone else. If the woman ceased to exist so would the fetus.gtAlthough the women WOULD be able to exist why would we not promote the father taking responsibility and helping for something he helped create and metaphorically speaking he almost becomes like the woman. Because it is irrelevant to the argument here and only serves as a needless distraction from the relevant topic.gtgtNo its not ludicrous. Lots of people are completely dependent on other people. Of course. And if one of them were to diequitcease to exist they could be replaced by someone else with a similar skill set.gtDude come on youre literally objectifying people also that wasnt my argument my argument was are people who are on lifesupport not human?Youre saying Im objectifying people in an attempt to undermine my argument yet Im not objectifying people.As i said above and in several different comments in the thread above of course people who are on life support are human. What differentiates them a fetus if they do not require a specific person to care for them and all people are there through their own free will. that is the key here.gtgtMy life as a human being began when I was born. Was there life that became part of me before that of course. There was a fetus. And an embryo before that. And a sperm and egg before that.gtAt that early age you had no comprehension or intellectual thoughts at to when you became alive. But did you not have a brain and spinal cord develop while you were in the womb? Would you say you werent alive then?Having a brain and spinal cord is not make one human. Being able to exist without your mother makes you alive.gtgtBut here is your the true heart of your argument finally. Sex is bad and people should be punished for it.gtReally man?  I actually see sex as a grateful and beautiful thing as its a gift from God and nature.You see sex under your strict guidelines only as a gift from god. The rest is fornication.gtAnd it deserves to be respected just as you would respect someone who gives a gift to you.Sex is not a gift. Neither is receiving affection social interactions and being part of a family. Thats just part of being human.gtAlthough two byproducts maybe pleasure and an emotional connection theres nothing more important than sex being used for its main purpose to produce children. Thats your opinion based mostly on dogma. One may argue that for the continuation of our species reproduction is the most important aspect of sex but that requires only a few dozen sexual acts. The other aspects of sex are more important most of the time. Especially once people are done having children or they are unable to. You know because it was gods plan for them to only have sex for pleasure and emotional connection.,MensRights,ddza03i,1,t5_2qhk3

The quote is I feel that manhating is an honorable and viable political act that the oppressed have a right to classhatred against the class that is oppressing them. Shes talking about the man such as the system or the patriarchy not actual men but its still gross to say and the implications are there as well that Im sure she adamantly hated men. This is not what intersectional feminism would preach and this is kinda gross that an early feminist would say but most early suffragettes were racist sumbags so Im not shocked. She was clearly filled with rage and maybe on her period when she said this just womanly things amiright?Hashtag killallmen is gross and not intersectional feminism. Theres a lot of hate on both sides for that. Its not constructive criticism productive conversations and plain hurtful. Men have been treating women like shit for centuries and no one seemed to mind then. Does that mean women should retaliate with a hateful hashtag? No. Its not my style at all and I disagree with it. Do you think its maybe the tiniest hypocritical that youre talking with a feminist who does not know about these hateful feminists though? Can you acknowledge that women face issues maybe even a few more struggles than men? I can certainly acknowledge that men face issues I dont have to and would happily work with someone on those issues. Thats what intersectional feminism works to do.I think we agree that we arent going to change one anothers mind but do you understand why your argument is flawed? I dont see an outpouring of men clamoring to fight against bigotry nor do I see many men fighting for equal rights in the workplace at schools in the government. I dont see mens right activists acknowledging theyve had it pretty good these past few centuries and maybe its time to share the equality. Should you be punished for history? Absolutely not.

11020650,0,t1_deges9m,This law is not about determining paternity. This law is only for the case of already courtdetermined nonpaternity to allow the nonfather to sue the actual father for compensation.  The state forced someone to pay for example child support that that person was actually not obligated to pay. With this law the wronged party is provided a legal avenue to determine who the person is that should have paid and sue that person for damages.  This is also the reason why the mothers privacy is  by default but subject to individual court rulings  assumed to be the lesser value here. Because it is not about her privacy or the fathers rights or the childs for that matter. It is about correcting a misapplication of state power  and the legal system must provide a recourse for that.  May years ago the law in Germany was that after a court determined nonpaternity the Jugendamt think Child Protective Services would on behalf of the child start legal action to determine the actual father. This was changed without properly accounting for the role the Jugendamt performed putting that responsibility on the mother. But since the mother is not a neutral party that opened a few legal loopholes. These were of course exploited went the distance through the judicial system the courts ruled that the situation is shitty but they cant do anything since it is legal due to a bad law passed some years before. That gets back to parliament and they iterate on the law again.  This is the most nonconspiracy ever apart from the implication that someone in government accidentally worked.

11029940,0,t3_5xgojx,In the old days we had Personnel Departments.  These did exactly what youd expect them to handle all the paperwork related to hiring and firing people.  But the modern world isnt comfortable with something this straightforward.  gt Why with a process that transparent the place will be filled to the roof with microagressing white guys and all their privilege.  We need some opacity if were going to get racialgendernonbinaryprononneurotypical justice and that means transparency is out.  So weirdly we do need some handholding.  Yes HR is going to shuffle the new hires paperwork around but they are also going to put up all those posters pumping diversity and they are going to make the annual review process involve Maoist selfcriticism and theyre going to produce sexual harassment training videos of stupefying mendacity.  So it is actually pretty useful for them to tell us that HR participates in systemwide policy and decisionmaking.  Especially since that involves decisions on whether you should be fired for making an offcolor joke after decades of loyal work for the company.  Sweetened bullshit indeed.HR closely resembles the old commissariat of the USSR and other Communist countries.gt Since the s human resources departments have expanded to the point where nearly every midsize company has an HR department. The purpose of HR is ostensibly to manage hiring employee retention and terminations but this could be easily covered by ordinary management. The real reason HR has grown so much over the years is legal and regulatory compliance. HR is all about following the rules from on high including affirmative action quotas policies regarding discrimination and harassment and other ideological matters.gt In this way HR closely resembles the old commissariat of the USSR and other Communist countries. Commissars were a fact of life in Soviet factories each of which had at least one politruk political officer who would enforce the rules and ensure adherence to Soviet ideology. In the final days of the USSR the politruk was seen as something of a joke not to be taken too seriously but for a long time people genuinely feared them.gt The real problem however isnt HR itself. HR is only there because of the myriad regulations that have been implemented over recent decades. If these poltically mandated regulations were removed companies would soon find HR to be a redundant department. More outspoken and honest people could breathe a sigh of relief and the workplace might come to resemble a prison a little less.gt It seems that companies have finally started to see HR as an undesirable institution. Hopefully Americans will soon come to the conclusion that the body of law that created HR is an even bigger problem and take steps to remove it. We cant fix our unemployment problems by continuously increasing the complexity and cost of employment or by creating a workplace environment that demands inhuman standards of behavior so as to conform to nutty equalist fantasies. ,MensRights,dei7vpq,12,t5_2qhk3

11131787,0,t3_5yy1yk,My teenage son and I have had the talk. No not the awkward one about contraception but the one about consent. Much to my own surprise I found myself telling him last week that when he goes to university he should think about getting his girlfriend or hookup I guess to say loudly and clearly Yes I consent before every close encounter.Even better while larking about perhaps they could video each other agreeing to proceed on their mobile phones.Paranoid? Moi? Not long ago I might have scoffed at such precautions. The world has gone insane Id have huffed if healthy men and women need the sexual equivalent of a prenuptial agreement before getting it on. Now I worry the hour of madness is already upon us. In fact I suspect my lecture was superfluous if only because boys are already spreading terrifying cautionary tales about this very issue among themselves.The good news is that juries are still capable of seeing sense about date rape  a term incidentally that is rarely used these days on the grounds that all rape is rape and thus equally abominable. Last week Lewis Tappenden  a former student at York St John University who had been working as a barman after graduation was acquitted of raping an yearold firstyear student who had invited him back to her room.I dont want to know you afterwards the female student is alleged to have saidThey had begun sexual activity while both out of their skulls on alcohol but as he was throwing up in the bathroom she sobered up and ran off to her flatmate to complain that things had got weird and she wasnt into it. The next day she told police she had been raped. If I were her mother Id have been on her side. A girl has a right to change her mind.Rewind a little though and it turns out the undergraduate had told friends at a drinking game that evening that she was going out to pull someone. Her flatmate said in court It sounds bad but that is what you do.Well yes it does sound bad. A lot worse than the alltoofrequent situation Judge Lindsey Kushner rightly warned against in her final verdict from the bench last week in which girls who drink themselves into the ground put themselves at risk from potential rapists who gravitate towards them. Its ridiculous that the judge has been criticised for stating the obvious.The luckless Lewis already had a girlfriend and had downed three beers and three triple vodka and Cokes with his mates when the female student began chatting him up on the dancefloor.Arguably he was the one who was too drunk to consent. So who was the predator? In court she claimed he had dragged her from the bar but CCTV images showed them laughing and snogging all the way back to her hall of residence.Maybe things did get a little weird later  her face and neck were covered in love bites that she may not have welcomed. She told the jury she was OK with sex at first but then froze in bed.So heres another safeguarding tip for young men. If a woman is comatose from drink or rigid with apprehension or at best looks as if shes lying back and thinking of England do not pass go. Shes not that into you.What astonishes me in this case is that the young woman had the nerve to go on the pull lure a man into her bed and then put his entire future at risk with a conviction for rape. She never knew his name and he was identified only after a police appeal when his girlfriend recognised his tattoo and reported him.I dont want to know you afterwards  I just want to f you the student had allegedly said. As Erica Jong has often sighed the zipless f in her s novel Fear of Flying was meant to be a fantasy not a template for female behaviour.By my standards the woman in this case just doesnt count as enough of a victim. I prefer the oldfashioned method of doing business which in its own way could be brutal too. A male friend of mine once found himself in bed with a woman who told him she didnt usually go in for onenight stands.Ungallantly he said What are you doing here then? and she clambered out indignantly. Feelings were bruised but nobody slept with anyone and they remained free agents.The American feminist Camille Paglia who never pulls her punches addresses the issue of consent in a new book of essays Free Women Free Men about the battle of the sexes.Despite hysterical propaganda about our rape culture she writes the majority of campus incidents being carelessly described as sexual assault are not felonious rape involving force or drugs but oafish hookup melodramas arising from mixed signals and imprudence on both sides.Bravo Camille. The campus wars would be funny if they werent so serious. Tappenden whose situation this perfectly describes spent  anguished months awaiting trial.Im not a violent person. I understand what consent is he told the jury. I feel my life has been ruined. I thought about killing myself because of the shame. He wept at the verdict.His accuser almost certainly feels wretched too. Either she was going to be responsible for jailing a young man who had drunkenly fancied her or she would be disbelieved in court  both horrible prospects. How could she imagine a trial was in her best interests?Until we awake from this lunacy Im scared for our sons and daughters.sarahbaxterSTM,MensRights,dets0mf,96,t5_2qhk3

11137461,0,t1_deuf3i9,Yes I do. And it isnt extra skin it was clearly meant to be there. In a typical infant boy the foreskin is a doublesided sleeve of skin and soft mucosal tissue that completely encloses the glans the head of the penis. It is actually physically bonded to the infants glans. This skin contains thousands of blood vessels and specialized nerves. In an adult it would grow to cover  square inches. Circumcision removes this part of the penis. The operator forces a metal clamp inside the foreskin and tears the skin away from the glans. The operator then slices the foreskin down past the glans and cuts the foreskin off. The entire procedure is excruciatingly painful. Infant circumcision is performed without adequate anesthesia since anesthetizing such a young infant can be very dangerous. Partial or complete amputation of the penis sometimes occurs. Some children even die from the trauma hemorrhage or other complications.Immediately after circumcision a child is at risk for infection and hemorrhage. The loss of the protective foreskin places him at risk for complications including meatitis inflammation and ulceration of the urinary meatus meatal stenosis constriction of the meatus resulting in blocked urinary flow and potential infection preputial stenosis scarring that constricts the glans and buried penis entrapment of the penis by scar tissue. Together these conditions which are almost unheard of in noncircumcised males affect up to  of circumcised males and may require additional surgery.A circumcised male may also experience chafing and abrasion of the exposed glans against clothing painful erections due to the tightened skin scarring and desensitization that can severely reduce enjoyment of sexual activity. A circumcised penis may be significantly smaller than it would otherwise have been. For more information see the Circumcision Information Resource Center under Complications of circumcision.What is the value of the foreskin?The foreskin has protective sensory biomechanical and immunological functions. Throughout life the outer part of the foreskin protects the sensitive inner part of the foreskin and the glans from injury abrasion chafing and infection. The foreskin keeps its mucosal tissue and the glans soft and moist so that it maintains sensitivity. During sexual activity the foreskin glides up and down over the glans providing sensation from thousands of specialized nerve endings in the inner foreskin. Parts of the foreskin including the frenulum a narrow membrane on the underside of the foreskin and the ridged band the edge of the foreskin between the inner and outer skin are particularly important in sexual function. See the Circumcision Information Resource Center under Foreskin sexual function. Circumcision removes most of the inner and outer foreskin and destroys these functions.The foreskin secretes immunological substances that fight infection called lysozymes and also produces natural lubricants reducing the need for artificial lubricants during sex. The presence of the foreskin can enhance the sexual experience for both partners. Polls of women who had experienced both circumcised and uncircumcised partners indicated a strong preference for the latter with longer duration of coitus and higher rate of orgasm cited as the main reasons for example see The effect of male circumcision on the sexual enjoyment of the female partner.Isnt female circumcision worse than male circumcision?Female circumcision is typically viewed by people in the U.S. as more horrific than male circumcision because it is usually done under unhygienic conditions rather than in a hospital and because one form of female circumcision infibulation is particularly severe. However both male and female circumcisions remove functional normal tissue cause extreme pain permanently disfigure the genitals and permanently damage the sexual response. And in most cultures where female circumcision is performed male circumcision is also performed with equally unhygienic instruments. Regardless of the childs gender when done to infants or children unnecessary genital surgeries violate human rights because they are amputations performed without medical need and thus cannot have legitimate proxy consent.The World Health Organization recognizes three types of female circumcision. Type I removes the clitoral hood andor the clitoral tip. Type II removes the clitoral hood clitoris and part or all of the labia. Type III also known as infibulation or pharaonic circumcision involves removal of all external female genitalia and suturing of the vaginal opening.Male circumcision can be compared to type I or II female circumcision. Although the glans is not harmed at the time of circumcision the loss of protective structures causes it to dry out and lose sensitivity over time. It is also important to note that most of the nerves and pleasure receptors present in the clitoris are in the male present in the foreskin and its associated structure the frenulum. Removal of these nerves constitutes a loss that can be most adequately compared to a partial clitoridectomy.,MensRights,deuf4qo,10,t5_2qhk3

Yet despite out qualifying them women in cybersecurity earned less than men at every level and the wage gap shows very little signs of improvement.What are the degrees in? If theyre nonIT degrees gained before the person decided to go into It security then theyre irrelevant.I worked for a while in TV production. At the time a similar survey came out showing that more women than men in the field had degrees and yet women still earned less on average than men.What it didnt control for among many other things was what the degrees were in and how long a person had been working in the field. Many of the women I knew had just graduated and were working as runners the lowest of the low gophers basically. They saw this as a route into production or front of house. The men often only had vocational qualifications but these were in technical fields in which there was a skills scarcity such as sound lighting camera operation and so on fields in which many of them had been working for years. Its just anecdotal but I would guess that this probably went a long way to explaining the earnings gap. Whatever the case the survey didnt bother to control for these factors and so was worthless. Of course that doesnt mean there couldnt be a problem discrimination against women in I.T security. But based on the information in this article there is no way to tell. And any action taken on the basis of this information would likely be ineffective at best and discriminatory against men at worst. ,MensRights,df0463o,8,t5_2qhk3

This review of the research literature sought to identify common predictors in the general population as well as in correctional and psychiatric samples. Further research is needed to improve identification of children and mothers at risk. Infanticide laws are discussed. Suggestions for prevention are made based on the current literature and the authors experiences.gtMaternal filicide is defined as child murder by the mother. Infanticide is child murder in the first year of life. The term neonaticide was coined by Resnick  to describe murder of an infant within the first  hours of life. Almost all neonaticides are committed by mothers. Neonaticidal mothers are often young unmarried women with unwanted pregnancies who receive no prenatal care.Such caring.gtParental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrator for neonaticide and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general.Yeah so naturally nurturing.,MensRights,df869x0,5,t5_2qhk3

11304850,0,t1_dfdbk3i,Actually it doesnt finish developing until .The thing is what does developing mean? constant and fast reshaping? If a brain is reshaping itself thats a good thing. a Brain which does not reshape itself as a matter of course of being alive is either dead or in an alzheimer sufferer.Brains are designed to continually upgrade themselves. People keep suggesting that the science tells us the brain is immature at one stage and mature at another.But if science is now telling us it doesnt finish until  what weve really been looking at this whole time is the brain trying to become smarter better faster as a matter of course. It isnt maturing its redeveloping in the same way you bulldoze some poor stupid peoples hovels like yours to gentrify an area of city.Brains constantly are in selfimprovement until .If thats the case it dovetails nicely with the FACT that brains without stimulus for  years do NOT develop whatsoever.Suppose you expose someone from an early age to understanding certain concepts or philosophies in a very nuanced way. While their brain may look superficially the same as a  gb hard drive will look superficially the same as another the OS can be completely different. The one taught heavily will be able to rationally use the information theyve gained on the subject and be far more adult on that subject than the one not taught it.Thats part of the problem.No two persons brains are alike. You might have on the macroscopic level the appearance of similarity but those neurons are NOT encoded for exactly the same things.And its a good thing too because this fallacious theory would suggest we would all actually be peas in a pod identical.gt Im not saying it should be  Im just saying it shouldnt be . But it certainly should not be  as we have all definitively established that the frontal lobes But you raised the point that it shouldnt be  in view of your outdated understanding of the neuroscience which says its around  where brains stop developing which as Ive said has no rational basis of discussion because brains are constantly reshaping themselves physically in response to stimuli. And the new science shows us that this continues well into the s.So if it shouldnt be  when you believe its around  that the brain finishes developing then it shouldnt be  when the brain finishes around the s according to your logic but  to  is a  year gap and if you suggest age of consent should be  years less than the time at which the brain stops developing then the ageo of consent should really be something like  ecause it doesnt finish until the s.This of course is all predicated on the nonsensical and almost comically simplistic and phlegmatic styled explanations that brains mature. They dont mature. They continue to develop. It is constant. People dont mature either on the exterior. They continue to develop.Ever see your favorite actress over the course of  years of screenshots? She just doesnt stop changing physically. She looks vastly different. the term mature brings the implication that people are finished like a product but people are in a constant state of change as such we can define the mature line wherever we want based on whatever metric we find culturally acceptable.When it becomes subjective like this due to culture it is clearly an irrational proposition.,MensRights,dfddyyo,1,t5_2qhk3

If you look into their backgrounds they will be some form of university graduate journalist professional activist or blogger all of them generally seem to be quite useless and deranged people.They are not protesting to help women by the way the womens march wasnt a march for women in the slightest either it was really just an antitrump march.

Something similar happened in Fallujah during the US assault on Iraq minus the crucifixions.  gtAndrocide was a common practice in ancient times. Mythological accounts of the Greek takeover of Miletus in circa th century BC have the legendary son of Poseidon Neleus leading a massacre of the men of Miletus and settling the city in the Milesian mens stead. Biblical androcides include the revenge for the violation of Dinah in the Book of Genesis in which Dinahs brothers Simeon and Levi killed all of the males in the city Shechem because Shechem the son of Hamor and prince of the land had sexual intercourse with Dinah it is debated whether it was rape seduction or other consensual intercourse when she went to visit the women of the town.

So instead they reach for that PC frigid term inappropriate. gt Thats inappropriate they say about everything from lads mags to rude rappers with none of the fireandbrimstone of the priests of old but with the exact same intent to censure us for doing something that they the rightminded consider bad. gt It is never us who decides whats appropriate never people like Gayle or McLaughlin who didnt seem especially perturbed by Gayles comeons. It is always them the secular new priesthood. gt Apparently we cant be trusted to negotiate public and sexual life on our own terms we need bettereducated busybodies to chaperone us. As a tool for Social Justice the code of conduct recognizes no boundaries between project person and politics. ... So when is a project participant not representing the project? The answer appears to be never.gt Notice the First Law of SJW at work the initial suggestion is that the Code of Conduct is simply about being nice and that there is nothing controversial about it. But then the moment that anyone objects the fact that there is controversy only proves the need for this uncontroversial policy to be implemented. And then notice how although the Code is said to be about nothing but feelings it needs teeth and private enforcement in order to be tenable.gt And dont forget the Second Law of SJW SJWs always double down. No sooner did Ferrara withdraw his attempt to impose the Code of Conduct on the project than someone else proposed it again.gt One of those who successfully resisted the initial entryist attack PHP project member Paul Jones explains in detail why the Code of Conduct is nothing more than an SJW weapon used to exert political control over an OSS projectgtgt Recently Anthony Ferrara opened an RFC for PHP internals to adopt and enforce a code of conduct. Even leaving aside for the moment whether this is an appropriate use of the RFC system the RFC generated a lot of discussion on the mailing list in which I participated at great length and for which I was hailed as abusive by at least one person in favor of the RFC a great example of a kafkatrapgtgt ... The Code of Conduct as presented enables its enforcers to stand in judgment of every aspect of your public private professional and political expression ... one must read the Contributor Covenant as a political document with political means and political ends. Specifically it is a tool for Social Justice .... As a tool for Social Justice it recognizes no boundaries between project person and politics. ... So when is a project participant not representing the project? The answer appears to be never.gt Never accept any Code of Conduct proposed for any reason. And every OSS project leaders should impose a rule that anyone proposing a Code of Conduct will be immediately expelled from the project. At a bare minimum only those who have been contributing to the project for at least three years should be permitted to propose discuss or vote on projectrelated rules.gt The entryism is of the usual type people with bluepink ideals join red  gray groups and try to achieve social status with in those groups then use that social status to push for the admission of  and promotion of  more bluepink members. Once the bluepink members achieve a majority they then change the rules of admission to create a lock on their new conquest in the case of academia for example even blue researchers in the Netherlands of all places were shocked by how blatant the process was.gt The status shaming is also of the usual type high status blue  pinks follow Alinksys battle plan.gt First they pick a lowstatus target rule . This target is usually a pale bespectacled Aspergersish nerd for a transgression against the norms they wish to universalize. The high social status pinks paint themselves as victims of a power imbalance then they use their superior popularity to outspeak the target and push their version of the narrative. Pink allies in the media join in to keep the pressure on rule . This is easy to do because the act of social shaming is not only fun but its clickbait so everyone involved not only has lolz they has cheeseburger rule . The toxic nature of the allegations is usually sufficient to make sure that the target of the attack does not get much if any sympathetic press rule  again Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions people hurt faster than institutions.gt We saw this in DongleGate when Adria Richards told her almost twenty thousand twitter followers that she was offended by the rampant institutional sexism she experienced when she eavesdropped on two low status nerds and the entire left wing media piled in to attack two blinking developers whod been pushed into the limelight with out any warning.

If a school doesnt have the funding theyre not going to implement a program that benefits the majority of the school let alone a mens centre which is needed by a very small portion of the schools population. This is why many have centres for the crisis itself rather than a womens centre or a mens centre. Schools cant afford to hand over such large amounts of funding just to cater to a handle of men that need it.

11791738,0,t1_dgwjp34,Ive been in group sessionstalks with people who have been raped. Some have dropped their accusations not because they werent raped but because they started being bullied and harassed by those loyal to the attacker. Then they go through the process of invasive questioning and other methods a defense attorney will do to defend their client. Nothing against the defense attorneys as its their job. But if you were attacked and traumatized it can be emotionally draining to have to go through all of it. It became easier to just focus on their own recovery without the abuse than pushing for justice. Thats one reason I get slightly hesitant. If we can  prove someone made a false allegation then fuck them up legally. False rape claims make other legitimate claims less believable. But some people dont realize victims of the rape can get harassed as well depending on who they are accusing. You can support and offer sympathy to either side without turning to yell at the other. So I dont want a trend to thinking just because someone dropped the claim they made a false allegation. The entire ordeal is emotionally exhausting and tiresome for both sides. Sometimes its just in their best mental health interest to just move on.,MensRights,dgwmt3h,2,t5_2qhk3

11810027,0,t1_dgyn03y,gt Thats not what it indicates at all. Prosecutors will regularly charge higher crimes than they know they can prove in order to encourage pleas like this one. That is a major assumption or are you suggesting that you know more than the prosecutor?  Prosecutors will also often have enough evidence to prove the charge but for various reasons offer a plea because its an instant win.The judge said they couldnt prove it was intentional and basically added an unspoken but after as if he was using the possible intent more as an aggravating factor than anything else. That just shows your inability to understand the English language.  The but refers to the seriousness of the effect.  Its wasnt intentional but a man died.  The not intentional was a mitigating factor.EDIT  I dont know what the mores are for making multiple replies to a comment so Im editing this one.Theoretically there is probable cause to sustain charges against a defendant. Thats already a lower bar than proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt Im not a lawyer and based on what youve said Im pretty sure youre not wither or at least not a criminal lawyer.  Laws also differ from state to state and Im most familiar with Illinois law.  There is a vehicle called a grand jury which I dont believe was used in this case or at least isnt mentioned.  The purpose of the grand jury in Illinois is in part when a prosecutor isnt sure that he has enough evidence to make a charger stick.  The fact that a grand jury wasnt convened indicates that the evidence was significantly past that lower bar thresh hold.  The prosecutor clearly had sufficient evidence to sustain the charge.,MensRights,dgyphcv,1,t5_2qhk3
