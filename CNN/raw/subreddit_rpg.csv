3813,0,t3_1u5xin,Time and time again I see people asking for advice into better improv. My favorite piece of advice is to prepare. Figure out what you are worst at improving and prepare for it. Have trouble coming up with names? Use a generator online to generate  names and write them down in your campaign notebook. Seventh Sanctum Donjon and Chaotic Shiny. Are the ones I use they have generators for just about anything you could need. Then when you use a name from your list write a one sentence tag line next to it to remember when and where it was used. Easy peasy.Want to give your PCs things to do aside from the main story arc? Come up with tentwenty mini quest plot hooks you drop interchangeably in places your PCs frequent. Some city fetch quests maybe a wilderness tracking mission perhaps a cargo job across the sea. Some forest encounters like merchant caravan being attacked. Etc. In some games they call them set pieces. A caravan is being attacked they could find randomly while travelling. A run in with an orcish prisoner transport. A thief chase through a city because she pick pocketed a PC. Little side adventures that they randomly do or dont run into. Some GMs rail against random encounters but personally I think they add excitement to any world.Another tactic if you are feeling stuck is to delegate nonplot descriptions. Have your players come up with descriptions of people and places you dont have plans for. When your players walk into a village have them describe the setting a bit especially NPCs you didnt plan for. PCs talk to the blacksmith? Have them describe what the blacksmith looks like as well as his mannerisms. If they try to turn the narration grossly in their favor then turn it back in them PC we find the blacksmith his name is Throg he is a jolly dwarf and sells everything at  off. Gm yeah he does thats why youll understand that he is sold out of all merchandise and can craft the things youre looking for in a month or two. yes and... or yes but... instead of no for player descriptions. You can even prod the PCs to come up with descriptions for NPC reactions to the PCs own skill rolls. PC I roll diplomacy to convince him to tell us the secret. Roll dicefailure. GM Explain to me how your diplomacy failed  why he wont tell you the secret. This really has multiple advantages it allows your PCs a bit of creative freedom with the world and will cause them to be more connected to it. If you come up with a faceless blacksmith with a generic NPC name the PCs are likely to forget blacksmith  Jimbo the human from Porttown because he is just part of the background however if a PC breathes a little life into an NPC youll be sure they will remember Throg the jolly dwarf blacksmith for a long time. These little things can turn a decent GM into a great GM without having to practice improv it just looks like youre really good at improv. These tricks work really well in sandbox style games but can really add a lot to any campaign. Good luck.,rpg,ceeve45,21,t5_2qh2s

52072,0,t3_1un599,gt Whether it be a literal assassin or some sort of stealthy creature how do you handle this situation?An assassin I find works exactly like a death trap. If you dont spot it youre dead. If you do spot it you can live.A lot of the other advice in this thread makes a lot more sense if you look at it from that raw mechanical point of view of how do I handle something that if it went unspotted would almost certainly or definitely certainly kill someone?The answer to this is the same in both cases make the threat badly designed from an inworld perspective with the purpose of having it well designed from a game perspective. Put more simply since it kills you if you dont spot it just let the players spot it! It sounds daft at first but stick with me on this one.Lets stick to the language of traps for a minute.Imagine you have a trap that is instantly lethal if sprung. Lets say that you walk down a hallway step on a hidden pressure plate in the floor and before you know it poison dart in your neck  now youre dead. If you were really making a trap to really protect yourself from adventurers looting your precious belongings this sounds like a pretty good one. Undetectable and almost assuredly lethal in a matter of moments.In reality though this trap fails the is it a game? test. Games rely on being able to interact with things improvisationally as their greatest strength  its something no motion picture or novel can do. Maybe the trap gives you a saving throw against poison but thats not really interaction  thats a calculation. So how can we fix that? Easy we make the trap suck. On purpose. Theres tons of ways to handle this. Maybe the poison is old and weak  now youre on a time limit to get the antidote and suddenly every wasted moment matters. Maybe theres a skeleton with a dart in the back of its skull laying slumped up against the wall nearby  now the players know to be careful against a threat that shoots darts unexpectedly they know theyre lethal and they know theyre unexpected because its the back of the head and can start interacting with the hallway to locate the trigger. Maybe you simply inform them that theres a cm diameter hole in the wall  darts gotta come from somewhere right? Perhaps the trap is actually a gigantic wall of poison darts that will blanket the room but it activates slowly enough that it gives a discerning click and a few moments to react.The trick here is to make it obvious that something is happening in the first place and then give the players time to engage with whatever that is. If youre a real stickler for simulation just make the clues spot check so low that they can easily see it without even bothering to roll if you must but dont hide the tipoff behind a roll. If they fail the roll theyll still be dead and lets see who can roll high enough to live is a game that doesnt stay fun for very long.This should all seem familiar in dealing with your assassin situation so lets apply what we know.First whatever you do you have to alert the players that theres some kind of assassination happening. This means that if its going to be lethal a slashed throat while you sleep for instance you need to give them a heads up before it happens. Another alternative is to make the attack less lethal  either the assassin sucks he misses his first shot and scurries off or his method is slow a slowacting poison for instance. Second you need to make sure that after being alerted its still possible to interact and avert their fate. If you tell them you wake up and theres an assassin plunging a dagger into your eye that tells them theres an assassin but it doesnt let them interact.Lets go through some examples. Coup de GraceThe PCs are asleep somewhere and the assassin sneaks up to do the deed. One possibility here is that the sentry or somebody determined arbitrarily simply notices something is up you hear something in this guys tent gt its the assassin surprise! he runs off.DelegationThe PCs get jumped by some thugs. A fight with a surprise round is tough but nothing too impossible. Bonus points here because one of the thugs can survive start to talk to give some plot clues and then get killed by a poison dart or something from offscreen by the real assassin a la Star Wars.PoisonThe assassin can poison the PCs in any number of ways. A good initial clue is that their food tastes strange  perhaps if they pick up on it right away the poison is less effective. Or maybe they just get a dart in the neck from a rooftop somewhere. In any case now theyre racing the clock against the poison. It can be as mundane as a plant based poison that kills them in  minutes quick get a cleric! or something as exotic as a poison that slowly wastes them away over the course of a few weeks quick consult a sage and find the exotic locale that possesses the only known antidote... which of course is being equally sought by the assassin to stop the PCs from getting to it in a final dramatic showdown!. Social AssassinationThe assassin doesnt kill the PCs but he does kill someone that gets dumped on their heads. Now theyre wanted men who have to clear their name and watch their every step  surely theyre out of the big bads hair right?Note how each of these does our two big things it lets them know first of all that there is an assassin and it also gives the players time to interact with the game world and try to resolve their situation in a favorable way. Once youve tipped them off that theres an assassin even better you can afford to get more brutal in your future assassination attempts  they already know whats up so they have no excuse to dally instead of dealing with their assassin problem.,rpg,cekcx7s,3,t5_2qh2s

For example Crouching tiger hidden dragon for the most part weapons act like they do in the real world. However there is a scene where Li Mu Bia is able to defend against a sword with a twig. Most people are confined by the rules of physics however masters of the art can seemingly fly. These are specific exceptions that propel the story forward. They would be represented by extra mechanics Extras Stunts or Aspects.I am almost tempted to ask if you saw the same movie I did.  The concept that real world physics intersected that movie at any point is a tad... err... you did see that movie youre not thinking of some other film right?gtIf players naturally gravitate towards the highest mechanical advantage why would players take fighting at all? Guns are superior. They have weapon damage they work at distance cant be blocked. Why would guns have weapon damage?  Theyre a prop that lets you use the shoot skill.  If weve established a world where the Hacking skill is important youd need a computer prop to use that but I wouldnt say youd get a bonus to hacking because youre using a computer to do so.gtaying that weapons exists only as possible aspects makes them doubly pointless. If you have to establish the aspect first there is no reason to have them as you can establish anything as an aspect with a roll. If no roll is required to invoke them they still dont matter because if sword is an aspect than so is hands free.Why would an aspect of hands free give you a bonus to your roll?  Id buy a sword aspect giving you an advantage in most circumstances but Hands free?  Nah.  gtThat doesnt fit into the narrative the idea that a sword is only sometimes effective. What does fit into the narrative is that sometimes a sword is ineffective. The idea that cutting a hair down the center lengthwise and arguing which half is which is useful on the other hand keeps cropping up.  gtUsing weapons like this will not create a DampD weapons race. Weapons simply are or arent effective. This isnt about the  sword of orc slaying or even going into the differences between types of weapons. A large cutting bludgeoning or thrusting weapon gets weapon . A small one gets weapon . Boom youre done.Why give any of them weapon any?  I tend not to emphasize combat in Fate and when I do I prefer freewheeling combat which feels unplanned and chaotic.  Static weapons fly in the face of that.

I like planning out dishes to serve and working out a theme and getting cool stuff for people to do. I like having my friends over and having fun with them while we sing karaoke with a machine I bought or race down the hill near my place on an adultsized bigwheel I rented. However Im not having fun anymore because my friends just get drunk ignore all the stuff I spent all the time and effort setting up and just start getting into fights.By your logic it is my duty to keep spending my money time energy and effort to entertain my friends when theyre not only not appreciating it but theyre actively ignoring it and abusing it. Theyre not laughing because theyre singing Britney Spears songs intentionally out of key. Theyre farting on the microphones and then punching each other in the face.As a GM I have a responsibility to play a game to have fun. While I have a lot of fun and Im so used to my games going off the rails that I dont bother trying to keep them on anymore but if Im not having fun Im not going to run a fucking game.I may get my enjoyment out of facilitating you having a good time but Im not going to make myself miserable and exhausted doing it when youre intentionally ruining it.,rpg,cewwpwk,6,t5_2qh2s

168839,0,t3_1w0ri7,I have been playing free storytelling roleplaying with my year old son for some time now when we were commuting or as a good night sory. He totaly embraced it and set up his own scenarios and characters though they are mostly based on things he knows like LEGO Minecraft and such. We play without any rules or pen and paper just telling each other what we are doing and discussing the outcomes.Very recently I introduced a more structured scenario where I am the storyteller and he is a young lad in the city of Havena from the old german rpg system Das Schwarze Auge. We still play without any fixed rules or a char sheet but I keep it rational and I have backround material like a city map to make it more coherent. Hes totaly into it.For now he has found a place to stay by slaying the cliche rat in the cellar for an innkeeper upgraded his dagger to a short sword and done some chores for another innkeeper. I try to no make him a brutal slayer but let him solve stand offs with other humans by intimidation or smooth talking. Most animals of course leave little other way than mortal combat but even this is resolved without dice but just by describing actions and me making it interesting but in the end letting him win. Im all on his side of course I just guide the story.Im thinking about switching to dices based situation resolving some time and introducing a char sheet with attributes and stuff but for now its much to convenient to be able to play anywhere at any time. And as long as just we two are playing and not a larger group I think its not that important.He also played Talisman the new th Ed with a group of my friends and me and while he had some fun it became a bit tedious for him to wait for five players to make their turn before he was active again. But Im planning to play a oneonone Talisman with him so that should be much more action. I think Talisman is great because its mostly based on luck and strategies dont work so well in the long term. So its not to complicated for him and I dont have a big advantage.In the end I mostly want to tell you DO ITAt least try it it can be lots of fun and if he embraces it you are doing something together that you realy like. While a premade adventure might help you get started just let your imagination find some things to do for him and he wont care if you dont make it a fully coherent story.,rpg,cexnwx4,2,t5_2qh2s

Basically the main question is Do they want to learn the rules?If they do I dont honestly think it matters what system and what if any other experience they have. They can read the rules if they want or if its easier you can teach everyone during play PROVIDED they can digest the rules they are taught during play so that by a few sessions in they arent still stuck on simple mechanics.Id say probably pregen characters are a good idea at first. Maybe if all goes well everyone who wants to keep playing after learning the rules would be able to choose between keeping the pregen or creating a new one from scratch.That being said theres one thing Id say to pay special attention to. Make sure that if people arent reading the rules and are only going off of your direction that they do learn rules when taught and store them in their head for later use. I had a player one time DampD who would refuse to put any brainpower to learning the game.

233262,0,t3_1wqn47,WoD Veteran here pfft... like there arent a shitload of those.Theres been a lot of good notes and advice thusfar and I encourage you to listen to them as well.However allow me to give you some cautionary notes for beginners To address your concerns from all over this thread running a drug ring from the slums isnt a terrible idea actually its a great one because its a goal. Vampire in either incarnation is not the kind of go here kill thing get stuff game that you find in other RPGs. It can be but the way the game and setting is designed it is in fact a freeform game focusing on politics and intrigue as opposed to fun with violence. So it isnt a bad idea to give your character a goal an ambition to work towards. For new players unfamiliar with the culture built around vampire society as crafted by the authors of the game having a goal that centers around mortal society is the best place to start hands down.You mentioned the two brothers in your game? The ones who own a lot of bars and nightclubs? Guess what these guys are your new best friends. Try to work with them get your people note get people selling your product in their businesses. Pay them a stipend or better pay them in some other services. Failing that have them buy product from you to sell in their businesses themselves. People on drugs make better herd remember that not for yourself but rather when youre talking to potential vampiric partners andor clients. I dont know how new you are to Tabletop gaming but Im assuming youre new enough to Vampire to merit this adviceHonestly drop the paranoid schizophrenic. Seriously I cannot tell you how many characters Ive seen lost to bad flaw choices. Its gotten to the point where if Im running a game with newbies I simply ban things like that outright. Especially mental illnesses of that magnitude. Schizophrenia is a nightmare for both you and the Storyteller the GM. If your ST is in charge of your derangement i.e. any hallucinations or delusions at best youll find it discouraging at worst youll resent your ST. If youre left to decide how the illness effects your character then you may as well not have it in the first place the point of the illness is that youre not fully in control of your perception of things so youre smart youll just ignore it in the first place and if you arent youll distract the game by playing it up or incorrectly. You may want to reconsider your clan. Gangrel are survivalists and loners not drug dealers. Their disciplines reflect a lifestyle that favors survival and combat not making friends and influencing people. If you wanted to be a smuggler or a vagabond sure but you want to be a drug pusher. Look into Daeva or Ventrue instead their disciplines reflect a lifestyle that favors social politics I think a Daeva would make a fantastic drug dealer. Ignore the shiniest things bloodlines secret factions crazy cool discliplines all these are nice but theyre better suited for players who have learned how to work within the setting and system first. Save it for later characters. Finally pick Ordo Dracul for your covenant. The coils of the dragon are fucking great. Expensive but the earliest levels give the best benefits and since their lore is so incomprehensible the ST probably wont have time to devote to it. The benefits are worth it reduce the need to feed lessen the urges from the beast fire hurts less and you can feed from animals no matter how high your blood potency gets. I honestly dont understand why anyone wouldnt want to practically erase the disadvantages of being a vampire.,rpg,cf4xdie,2,t5_2qh2s

Wed been fighting a running battle against undead for most of the time we were there  the crews of most of the ships had risen as undead and we were low on resources  wounded drained of spells and tired. We needed a place to hole up rest and heal badly or we were going to die.  We found ourselves heading toward the broken ruins of a ship as it was just about the only cover we could see. It was mostly intact but we knew from experience we should expect a fight if we were going to board it  like I said lots of undead crews around.What we did not expect as we trudged our way through the dried seabed was for a pack of wraith sharks to come arrowing out of the ruined ship and swim through the air toward us. They were ghosts so the lack of water didnt matter at all to them  they could swim through the air just as well. They darted among us much faster than anything we were used to facing and tore at us draining levels and ripping us apart.

She had an irritating habit of passing notes during the session so that she could say whatever she wanted without someone overhearing. She passed me several notes about another female player.  She invited new players to a group that already bordered from  players during any given session. It was bluntly humiliating.One time she asked if I could do a session that took place in her characters homeland. Yeah sure alright. No problem. Circumstances actually had it that one of the campaigns major villains was operating in that area and the party was likely to deal with them soon anyhow.Beginning of the session theyre on a ship to her homeland when a Blue Dragon erupts from the ocean lands on the deck and accuses That Girls character of transgressions against Tiamat herself. She had robbed a shrine to Tiamat in the last session. Everythings going great  I manage to engage her characters backstory while also making sure the other players were still interested. Things are going great. We take a break for dinner. She passes me a note saying something along the lines of Shes talking about me behind my backreferring to the other player. I then text the other player and ask whats up and apparently the other player and her had gotten into an argument about why I didnt give That Girl special treatment since she was my girlfriend. The other player insisted that I was trying to keep the game fair and That Girl responded withgt Im the DMs girlfriend. You should deal with it.Im getting fed up with this crap. I take That Girl aside and tell her that its not appropriate behavior from either of them. I do the same for the other player. Everyone seems to agree to get along since its a FREAKING GAME. After an investigation sequence the party discovers a group of damaged Warforged which are basically drowning people in acid. The party of heroes jumps in to slay them and turn order starts to drag on towards the endthis is just a pacing issue with the system. That Girl passes me another note saying something along the lines of Im bored. This was not what I wanted you to do. And I tell her that well talk about it later because everyone else is still having fun and Im thinking shell enjoy whats in store past the combat.At this point she stands up and walks out of the room. Im forced to come to a choice  put the game on hold for  players while I try to console my girlfriend because she isnt the center of attention anymore or continue the game. Ive made my decision at this point  I just keep running the game. When her turn in the initiative order comes up again shes already driven away so I take her miniature off the map and play continues.This girl ruined  of my closest friendships insisted that she was more important than anyone else and threatened one of my closest female friends. When she came back the next week she asked if I wanted to hang out. I pointed to the table where  or  of the players already were seated and told her that I had plans.,rpg,cf883ww,6,t5_2qh2s

271504,0,t3_1x6ygc,One interesting alternative I saw went as followsThe DMG assumes that you will budget your encounters in such a way that every  encounters or so you will have given out enough XP to gain a level. Therefore every encounter should give  XP and players earn a level every  XP they get.Or there is the way the old West Ends Ghostbusters game handled it. In Ghostbusters players have a stash of Brownie Points. These are sort of a combination of Fate points bennies and hit points combat is lethal but if you spend brownie points you can change the fiction to where you werent hurt as badly as you thought. You can spend  brownie points to increase your stats or you can decrease one of your stats in exchange for  brownie points. If you accomplish a character goal you gain some brownie points as well depending on the goal and how you did it. At the end of an adventure if you did badly in the adventure the GM refunds you some of the Brownie points you spent. If you did ok in the adventure the GM refunds all the Brownie Points you spent. If you rocked the adventure the GM refunds all your Brownie Points and then gives you some extra.,rpg,cf8wh50,1,t5_2qh2s
273163,0,t3_1x6sgg,Sure Rifts has its issues but there is some fun to be had here if you dont get hung up on the rules.  Since you have some other points already on the hard rules Im going to focus on amp.  Character CreationMy advice would be to stick to a set of books and really GM limit the options that your players have.  Rifts is a huge setting that gives options too many options and many of them dont play well with others balance is a huge issue with the game.  If you have a central purpose you might suggest that your players pull from the same materials to make the team.  The other point to this ask your players to tell you what they want and help them find the character.  This has worked out well for me in the past when we played Rifts.  Character wants to play an Android have it be something undercover that ARCHIE  made might have that number wrong.  Character wants to play a jedi?  Cyber Knight might work for you.  Robot Jock?  Glitterboy with a patched up suit thats been passed down through the family.  Dragon?  Well you can make that call but there are baby dragons.  Its helpful to focus your characters.  Just because they read about an OCC or RCC in a book doesnt mean that you should let it into your game.  Personally I love juicers and cyborgs good fun all around and something thats a bit different than other games.  House RulesI would limit book selection for resources and items unless you want to push something in a characters direction.  If the character is playing a Juicer and wants to pick up.  Some books were really broken and you might want to limit what characters can pull from them.  Phaseworld Atlantis South America... probably out.  North America focused books are pretty balanced but thats a boon and bane of the system.  Anything can be in Rifts.  If you have characters using Power Armor and Robots I would suggest hit tables.  Some bots are hell to put down others seem easy.  Theres often a need for a bit of balancing.  If you want to up the ante a little spells and burst hit areas and spread their damage out based on the accuracy of the hit.  Missile Rule  Power Armor A Fires at Monster A.  Doesnt get a lock on before firing so no modifiers or low modifiers.  If the weapon hits combat is a bit of a joke so I suggest a confirm hit on combat rolls roll again to determine success of the hit.  The second check gives the percent of damage rolled to a location.  Depending on size I have missiles and area spells hit multiple locations on botsmonstersetc.  Tends to make things more exciting.  This also prevents a perfect burst from killing player and enemy alike in combat straight away A Dx MDC shot can wreck a players day a dx Boomgun can mean rolling a new character.  But if the shot hits and only  catches the target that can change things and give it a dramatic feel that the rules lacked. Combat Rules  Hitting a target is really easy let your players know that you are going to use modifiers based on story and roleplay.  If the player takes a skill in a weapon they can land hits on a  at level .  Leveling  Call it when you see it.  The leveling mechanic and EXP is a problem.  Track characters work deeds whatever.  When theyve done enough to move up tell them that they level up.  It removes the feeling on players of an EXP grind and they can focus on story.  Learning new skills  As the game grew there were more skills introduced and theres often too many.  While characters might get a skill as they level up having a training mechanic where they can learn new skills based on time and investment can expand the skill gain.  Otherwise the leveling base of Character gains a skill at level    etc. is a problem.  I just leveled up Ill take PreRifts History without reading any books and coming from an illiterate background.  It will make for a more enjoyable game.  Have fun with it  I liked a lot of the story ideas for Rifts the rules were hell though.  I wish I had a system that I would suggest you lay over Rifts so just be light with the rules. Roll some dice to judge successes but dont let that be the end all for this game.  If you do that and the players are into it with you.  Wed often work out the target number for an extreme action at the table and players knew what to roll to make it or not.  Failure wasnt immediate I had degrees of failure or success based on the dice.   above or below was close  moderate failure or success then  would be dramatic failure or success.  Makes the game more interesting.  If you have a central theme to the game that can help as well.  My best games  Right after the fall  Did a NEMA game where the players got to see the rifts first forming. Coalition States  Ran a game where the players were all soldiers. Juicier Game  higher power the get pulled into the politics of that. Xiticix Hunters  mixed group that went wild. Burbs  players did different aliens trying to live together.  Have fun love the setting wish it was cleaner.  ,rpg,cf92p5x,2,t5_2qh2s

281083,0,t3_1xbg9w,Very interesting thread as a lot of connected issues come up frequently.Firstly objectivity is all important.  You are the world.  The world does not care it does not help nor hinder.  This is the promise most RPGs make and if players dont trust it then they start interacting with you to start or stop things and dont trust that they can interact with the world to get things done.Secondly I cant entirely explain players acting like psychopaths but I have seen an awful lot of it.  People become detached they become idealized selves often becoming machines of pure efficiency.Dont punish them.  But you might want to show them.  Perhaps big up a mighty hero who slew a dragon.  The players make it into a deep nasty dungeon and inevitably run into trouble.  In whatever room they run into trouble they meet Mr Shiny Paladin the hero.  And it turns out that Mr Shiny Paladin is a dick.  He wont help heal them he eyes up their magical items he shows off his fancy armour he orders around his henchmen as if they were slaves.  He threatens to kill the characters if they insult him.  If Paladins still have that layonhands ability the players could request it after being badly hurt and he could say Nah Im saving that in case I get hurt.  He wont kill them but will maul them if they get annoying.  He will also steal all the large treasure and possibly charge them extortionate prices for some basic healing.Finally give them a chance to make amends.  Have one of his comrades injured.  Instead of helping he walks away.  The players can pick up the wounded character if they like.For really hitting the point home have the paladin turn into an undead Dark Knight.  He could be a baddy for them later.,rpg,cf9wbd8,24,t5_2qh2s
281815,0,t3_1xbg9w,I have a somewhat similar situation in a totally different kind of game. The players decided that they as heroes of course could do no wrong. So they basically just started throwing NPCs from this village under the bus. Lying to people causing mayhem etc. Eventually it came about that they caused a lot of people to be injured with their reckless behavior including causing the death of the constables beloved who was well regarded by everyone. Then they decided to have a showdown with the constable and basically just beat him up and told him he was being silly. So I turned the constable into a shell of a man bent on revenge. Every few sessions at pretty random times when the group splits up even to go into separate rooms of an inn Ill have him waiting in the shadows with a dagger. He knows he cant fight them straight up so he just follows setting traps ambushing turning townspeople against them and foiling their plans. If the group masses to fight him he runs. It doesnt take a demon lord to be a great threat. Ruin a gentle happy mans life and the most unassuming and innocuous NPCs can become the greatest bane of your existence.,rpg,cf9z25c,20,t5_2qh2s

293687,0,t1_cfauhfe,FATE is a role playing system that relies on a strong narrative rather than a dice mechanic to play the game. It only uses  three sided dice d with  plus one sides  minus  sides and  blank sides. Fudge dice is what you can look them up as.  Instead of stats with numbers characters have aspects short phrases that describe the pc in some way. Such as Big strong arms and Nimble like a fox. But at lest one of the aspects can be flaws like Cant resist money or No good around women or men. These character flaws are one of the ways the GM can make things interesting. Its a really fun system. Its simple enough to learn and open enough to keep interesting. It is not so much the GM vs. the PCs but more collective story telling.

295901,0,t3_1xgvsb,In the last longrunning campaign I DMd I made a setting ruled by a tyrantking that was being influencedoutright controlled by Caiphon one of the stars through which Star Pact Warlocks can gain their power. Centuries ago he had supposedly killed Pelor destroying the sun in both a literal and religious sense which plunged the planet into an ice age and eventually the population dwindled and the very concept of a sun was forgotten.  I started the campaign with the intention of this king being the overarching antagonist that hounded the party. As such he was designed as a relatively highlevel enemy since I only wanted the campaign to run to around Paragon tier e if that wasnt already apparent. So he was about an th level encounter Im pretty sure designed to be a solo boss. Flash forward about a month or two into the campaign. The party is level...  I want to say. Maybe . Im sure one of the players will pop in here to set me straight with the numbers. Anyway I digress. Point is that they were still little more than grunts. The party makes their way to a town that is used as a training ground for the kings soldiers. Early into their visit they learn that the king himself is visiting to oversee a tournament. Being the good adventurers that they are they decided to sign up for this tournament if only to get a look at this king. They fight their way through the tournament and eventually end up in the final match and win when the king addresses them directly. We have now officially entered the Point of MadnessTM . The party goads him. And they goad him. And they goad him some more. The Changeling in the party morphs herself into the form of the kings old love interest and friend whom they had met earlier as what was ostensibly a lich without a phylactery. So the king does what any sensible allpowerful overlord would dohe draws upon the power of a mad star and attacks the hell out of them. Thisll put the fear of God in em I say to myself. Ill have him rough them up a bit and they can either run away or lose and the king will show some twisted form of mercy and the show can go on as planned. They win. They fucking win. Whats worse they specifically knock him unconscious specifically with a backhand from the partys Warlord to add insult to injury. What is even worse they take the item that links the king to Caiphon and shove it in a magic backpack severing the link such that the king is now just a man. What is the worst they strap him onto the back of the Berserkers pet smilodon and continued to cart around his comatose body for over a year ingame. This event is the exact moment I realized that as a DM your plans dont mean a damn thing once your players jump into your campaign. ,rpg,cfbfpku,19,t5_2qh2s

Humans evolved to fill an ecological niche so rare that most beings dont even know it exists Humans are missile predators.  That is primitive Humans hunted by pelting their prey with improvised projectile weapons.  Fun Fact  Primitive Humans hunted  of their planets large land animals to extinction before they discovered writing. In the same way that flightcapable species general evolved with greater spatial reasoning or pack hunters evolved with excellent cooperative instincts Humans beginnings as missile predators granted them an uncanny natural grasp of the physics of gravity.  This manifests in surprising ways. The Human sport of Basketball for example revolves around throwing a ball  cm diameter into a hoop thats only slightly larger  cm diameter suspended  meters above the ground. Fun Fact  While elite athletes of other species find these types of games incredibly difficult to play competently even preadolescent Humans are naturally quite skilled in them.This strange intuitive grasp of physics has also caused Human projectile weapons to be disproportionately advanced.  Humans invented siege equipment such as the catapult before inventing the mathematical tools necessary to explain how it worked.  Due to this lopsided rate of development they have a number of technologies with no analogs in other cultures see grenade crossbow trebuchet.Fun Fact  Humans invented rockets capable of leaving their planets atmosphere before they invented transistors.In addition to their advanced weapons Humans have incredibly robust biochemistries so much so that the explorers who discovered them nicknamed them Poison Eaters.  Humans enjoy the flavors of the chemicals that plants produce to deter pests from eating them.  They frequently eat  toxic organic sulfides see garlic onions and use small doses of what other races consider a chemical weapon to season their food see capsaicin.  One of their delicacies Chocolate is toxic to nearly every other intelligent race.  Fun Fact  Almost all species recreationally alter their neurochemistry.  The Human intoxicant of choice is  ethanol a common industrial solvent.  Early terrestrial Human empires spent much of their fortunes scouring the world for toxic plants to import as food flavoring agents see  saffron mace cinnamon cloves black pepper.  These toxic substances have an antimicrobial effect that make the Human body resistant to disease.Fun Fact  Primitive humans preserved their food by making it too toxic for other lifeforms to eat often by soaking it in vinegar.These incredibly immunities come from a number of organs dedicated specifically to filtering poisons and diseases out of the Human bloodstream.  Many of these systems are redundant  Humans have two kidneys a multilobed liver and dozens of lymph nodes.  Fun Fact if a Humans liver is cut in half it will grow back to its original size often within a year.Due to their robust physiologies and advanced weapons Humans are able to thrive in virtually any terrestrial environment.  Humans have only one real weakness their reliance on gravity.  When a Human experiences a change in gravitational conditions it will become disoriented and sometimes ill.  Humans cannot survive in the long term in zero gravity  all Human colonies simulate gravity.  Event short term exposure to zero gravity on the order of weeks causes serious muscle decay and bone density loss in Humans.,rpg,cfll04g,6,t5_2qh2s
401155,0,t3_1ymut6,One of my players was playing an alchemical golem warforged stats alchemist from a sunken Atlantisstyle civilization. It had just awoken at the start of the campaign greatly weakened with some virus running through its circuitry. A few sessions in the golem met another of its kin named Anchor who had been at the bottom of the ocean for hundreds of years had all its weaponry rusted off and had barnacles encrusted all over it. Anchor was mute but always loyal and found ways to be useful. Much like a ship anchor it would weigh things down. Ordinarily the two golems could interlock parts of their arms and share information but the disease that the PC had made that impossible. The PC met an incredibly old elf from the fallen Atlantean civilization who promised to be able to cure the disease. Instead he kept giving the golem temporary antidotes in exchange for some frankly awful favours. The biggest one was making the golem create a giant alchemical bomb to defend the city they were in. The player wrestled with this so much because shes a pacifist but ultimately decided to do it because her character isnt. So of course the villains who had opened a rift to another dimension above the city got a hold of it and in the final battle they were about to drop it down a chasm in the city. A dragon was carrying it there. So Anchor fired himself out of a cannon and landed on the dragon anchoring it down and dragging it into the rift and dying in the process. But that wasnt enough. No at the last moment the PC found Anchors arm detached from his body and finally the two managed to link and share knowledge. ,rpg,cfmcg5a,5,t5_2qh2s

428636,0,t3_1yzafn,First just assume the dragon gets out somehow. Dont worry about making it superdetailed or plausible. He just does and the PCs dont know how. They didnt see it so they dont know.Then you need to decide how vindictive the dragon is and how much effort you want to spend on this. Im guessing the biggest problem you have now is a lowlevel party with a ton of treasure. You can make that an advantage though. Where do they keep it? How do they spend it? What is the form of the treasure? s of coins? Jewels? Art?If they start flashing lots of coin or bragging the dragon will hear about it eventually andor other thieves will come after them. Dont necessarily try to punish the PCs but instead focus on retaking that treasure. Make it an ingame thing not just...you wake up and all your stuff is gone! but make it really hard. High level thieves an entire army of mercenaries or the dragon confronts them directly.,rpg,cfp6ywq,2,t5_2qh2s

478010,0,t1_cfu22bg,What I love about this whole thread is the way it explores how different people have different expectations of DampD and how the games evolution has shaped those expectations. People coming from different backgrounds joining game groups run by different DMs playing different editions come up with varying ideas about whats good and special and worthwhile about this game. This is why when you have two people looking at the same feature one of them will say this is a huge improvement and the other will say this is destroying everything thats good about this game. Thus we have the Edition Wars huge numbers of people who all love the hobby in various ways fighting bitterly with each other about why their version is best. This serves noone and in fact its a significant downside to playing RPGs almost every RPG fan I meet is firmly established in one camp or another and needs only the slightest of provocations to tell you why your favorite edition sucks and his is better.Many of the discussions were seeing in this thread have a very different quality they are trying to discern what makes people enjoy one edition over another. They are unearthing the design goals upon which the mere mechanics are built and examining the unique strengths of the different editions on that basis. I find that downright inspiring and far more productive than rearguing which game is better. Is sushi better than spaghetti? Is yellow better than blue? No but they are different and there are times where you want one thing over another.Fourth Edition has a really heavy emphasis on balanced gridded tactical combat. Its good at that. If you want gridded tactical combat you should try e! If thats not what youre looking for try something else! But arguing that Fourth Edition is not a good game is divisive and destructive and ignores its many strengths.Personally Im getting tired of e its taught me a lot and Im about ready to move on to something else. But I will continue to respect the things it diddoes well and I will remember those lessons as I go on to play DampD Next and Pathfinder and FATE and all the other games the future has to offer.I apologize for my oneline comment it was snippy and unkind. Kindness is something this hobby needs more of. There are so many many games out there to play each with their own strengths and weaknesses and we shouldnt factionalize around which is best when we can play all of them one after another enjoying each one for what it is and incorporating the best of each into our houserules and homebrew adventures.,rpg,cfulpg3,2,t5_2qh2s

If NPCs are always uninjured then injury tables are far more punishing to players than anyone else since enemies will almost never actually suffer from a wound beyond the end of the current combat and players will.

It was fairly straightforward just assume that the guns have some slightly more futurey abilities add a bit of topical equipment and go to town. The campaign didnt get terribly far  sessions but that had nothing to do with Savage Worlds suitedness for the setting.SW is definitely very well suited to having a wide disparity of tech levels all mixed together.You can check out the ruins of my Obsidian Portal wiki for that campaign here if youre interested ,rpg,cg1ynfo,2,t5_2qh2s

576318,0,t3_20kj9y,Mutants and Masterminds really becomes something special when you use it as a system to support your creative descriptions rather than relying on the game to tell you how cool you can be. Some of the best fights Ive run and played in was Mutants and Masterminds but theyve all required the storyteller to think on their feet and improvise. My friend was running a Superman game for me and I was fighting Mongol. It was not going well both characters are invulnerable super powered brutes. It wasnt until I had the idea to slam him through the first hundred feet of soil into the rock turn the rock molten with heat vision and then rapidly cool it with him in it with freeze breath before I beat him. But that was accomplished by coming up with some quick rules on the fly allowing for a cool idea to take hold. It also involved knowing how the difficulty numbers were and applying a difficulty to a random task that isnt specifically covered by the rules. Im pretty sure I needed to Extra Effort the heat vision to melt that rock. Which is the other thing Extra Effort Power Stunts Alternate Powers Power Attack Defensive Attack the array of combat maneuvers  all those contribute to mixing combat up a bit. But at the end of the day its not a system where the players are trying to beat the storytellers game. Its more collaborative. Which is why its so hard to really die in that game. ,rpg,cg5s5mb,1,t5_2qh2s

As for general GM advice things will occasionally go off track thankfully good adventure paths cant comment on Rise of the Runelords specifically but Paizo does good work imo tend to include text telling you how to shoehorn it back on track without railroading. For notes take into account what each player seems to like how the combats are going you may have to adjust difficulty up or down and anything else you think is important. Remember rule number one is to have fun yes it can be serious at times but striking a balance is key. If you havent i would suggest cheat sheets for the players nothing too fancy just some basic stuff while the character sheets do cover a lot of it it can be helpful sometimes for new players. ,rpg,cg68dxk,2,t5_2qh2s

How would you go about getting players to go to a specific location because I feel like if I misjudge something they will just not want to go. I need to get them to a farmstead some way in to our first session and I am worried that if I dont give the right incentive on the first try they will just fight any further attempts because they were already decidedly against it either in or out of character before. as you give chase the bad guy takes off running you lose sight of him but the only places in the nearby area he could be heading are the bus terminal or the a nearby farmstead and you are at the bus terminal so.. Bad guy is going to set a trap were not going. Well it is also hinted to have some leads you may want to pursue? Bad guy is going to set a trap were not goinig.

588863,0,t1_cg77ax4,I agree with all of this. Id also add that as a possible option you might consider keeping the characters amp setting just as they are but swap rulesets to something where that fear of death doesnt seem so mechanically inevitable amp port over the PCs. Ive played a lot of games in my day and I confess that feeling of doom always seems to creep in when I play DampD other than in e that is.Dungeon World and th Age are a couple of games that take many cues from DampD but give players more help to ease them into pursuing story feeling confident amp taking risks instead of only trying to get out alive. Dungeon World has the added benefit of making improv and going with the flow a lot easier on the GM plus its free! Trust me on thatI learned a ton from running a campaignlength game of Dungeon World for my friends and I was a plenty experienced GM before that!Edit the other thing Id suggest is to ask what precisely appeals to them about the SkyrimDon Quixote concept. Try to find out from them the concrete elements that make the idea cool. You could even have them directly rate their interest in the pieces that seem fundamental to the idea like exploration battle dungeons amp tombs the wilderness finding forgotten ruins of a bygone age making discoveries via the incharacter texts found while adventuring trade amp crafting random encounters amp quests lots of storylinesquests in progress at once joining amp rising in guilds amp factions epic worldchanging storylines amp destinies getting to know lots of different towns amp regionsAnd so on. Try to see which pieces have the most allure. If it seems that what they say they want amp how they act in game are two different things point out that discrepancy amp drill down to see whats causing the disconnect. ,rpg,cg77hpn,4,t5_2qh2s

Could have been a present from his big brothers in the gang.  More generally does your character have any favorite items even if they are common things he just always keeps on hand ie a specific poison or favorite pair of boots that he really likes. Are there any types of marks your character will not take the assassination contract for IE Orphans women?   Why did your character not flee with the rest of his gang?  Where they merely scattered?  Is he the sole survivor of a massacre?  If so does he now burn for that revenge or is he just too emotionally exhausted after all those loses? Why would the party have chosen him randomly in a bar to help with Goblins?  Hes obviously a shady character why did they think he would be especially helpful or at least more so then the local village thug?  I liked your rogues backstory.  Sounds like a good start.

593155,0,t1_cg7mfr7,Chuckle. Okay Im DMing a e campaign now and I used that terminology without thinking about it. Good catch. However Ive used the same strategy in .e though I grant you the monsters in .e are not quite as modular as in e. Most groups do not stay on the rails and every DM in every system needs to develop some improvisation skills. For most DMs its easier if you do some preparation ahead of time.  Im not quite sure what you mean about character vs. story driven but Ill try to answer I never show up and ask the players What do you want to do tonight? I always have some kind of a plan. Normally I have a big story arc going on and my plan is for every adventure to tie into that arc somehow. I try to have things planned out  sessions ahead of time and to have a couple of prepared eveninglong surprises I can pull out in a pinch. Note It helps a lot if your party develops a powerful villain who hates their guts and keeps hiring goons to come after them.However game sessions rarely go exactly the way you planned. Its much easier if you keep the party in a linear dungeon like the way many published modules are set up but even then it doesnt always happen. No dungeon goes on forever okay almost none of them there are always decision points even if its just the characters finding a plot hole in the published storyline. When the players do something you dont expect you can slap them down or try to run with it. I try to run with it within limits because players often come up with good ideas and it keeps everybody on their toes. ,rpg,cg7p21g,2,t5_2qh2s

605717,0,t1_cg9405p,A living vibrant world should not be conflated with a linear by the numbers plot.  NPCs can and should posses personal motivations but the barkeep should not always only be encountered at the bar.  But that does not mean there needs to be a plotbynumbers for that to work.    It is the players game.  You are there to have fun invent interesting encounters not only combat for them to toy with and explore.  A GM is not there to win or to be on top you are there to provide for the people who are asking you to take them on a journey they will bend and twist and experience.    Seed and railroad are two vastly different things it is black and white.  Check out the Lazy DM book for why and how this is so.  Your seed is too simple that is not a good seed.  A good seed is The children of the town are waking with strange dreams and freshly cut symbols upon their bodies.  From there have three antagonists and three protagonists who are invested in that seed plus a few locales that might be searchedadventured at.  The rest is in the players hands.  They might not encounter the NPCs or go to any of the three places.  They may have a different idea as to what is happening and why.  Go with THOSE ideas not yours.  Explore those use the players AND their characters actions to further the plot not your own.    It depends.

626946,0,t1_cgbj8sk,. Everyone in the bar furtively watches every move the PCs make. They deny any sinister purpose and take no hostile actions. In reality the patrons of the inn love to gamble on just about anything and they have an elaborate pool going on everything from what the PCs order for dinner to who goes to the bathroom first. If a PC figures out what is going on they are allowed to participate but only if they promise not to tell the other PCs or affect the outcomes.. One of the other inn patrons stands up suddenly grasps at his throat as if he is choking and then collapses. Most reasonable efforts to prevent him from dying fail.  minutes after he dies he suddenly gasps and comes back to life with no memory of what happened. Everyone in the bar is suddenly afraid of the otherwise normal looking man who is not what he seems. Then the same thing happens to the PCs.. The small village inn has been taken over by the town children. Due to some tough times a few years back the town is short on adults and the inn fell into disrepair.  Some of the local kids and orphans fixed the place up so they could have a place to stay and accidentally found themselves running a successful business. The oldest among them is their yearold leaderbartender.. When the PCs are leaving the inn one day the innkeeper says someone has delivered an unmarked package for them. Inside a small box they find a bag full of coins a note which simply says per our agreement and a severed elf ear.. PCs wake up to a noisy festival which apparently starts very early in the morning. The male bartender downstairs is wearing a dress. He explains that it is traditional to dress as the opposite gender on this holiday. He keeps a few spare outfits for guests that visit town unprepared. Unless the PCs refuse they find out the hard way that the festival is really a day of joy humor the settling debts and practical jokes.. An experiment in the kitchen causes a strange nontoxic gas release. Its harmless except everyones voice is two octaves lower for the rest of the day. Eating the foul smelling food that caused the problem will seems to remove the effect. This recipe might come in handy when the party has to infiltrate a group of orcs later on.. The waitress in the inn is extremely superstitious. She only takes orders from her left only serves to her right wont take payment if the coins are turned face down runs around the inn three times if anyone drops some food on the floor and eats an olive if someone curses. The inn is running dangerously low on olives.. The only employee working at the small inn today is Gillik the Deaf. If the PCs want anything from him they have to write it out. Gillik is not really deaf. He just pretends to be deaf because people ask him to do a lot less work if they have to write out the request. PCs that search through Gilliks trash can find a variety of very interesting requests from other patrons.. A snake spooks a horse pulling a hay filled cart. It runs out of control and crashes through the front wall of the inn. The horse and driver are killed and the contents of the cart spill into the inn. Underneath the hay are several tied up gagged and very frightened kobolds.. Before today the inn has only ever had a handful of halfling patrons. Today they have . They all came in independently and claim to not know each other.. The inn has a small reading library of popular novels beside the fireplace. A regular patron has been slowly reading through the whole library and secretly burning the books that dont stand up to his literary standards.. One of the PCs is recognized by a patron who knows them from previous exploits. Hes a big fan. In fact he is such a big fan he asks them for an autographs then tells everyone in the bar who they are. If only the PCs werent on an undercover mission at the time. A shady looking and slick talking person that the PCs have never met suddenly sits down at their table. He tells them Jerri sent me. The job is all set up and ready to go. You can do the hit tonight at midnight behind the inns stables. If the PCs claim they dont know whats going on he assumes they are just acting cool. Oh yeah. Sure. Sure. I was never here. I dont know you. Wink wink. No amount of professing ignorance will convince him otherwise. He leaves just as suddenly as he came and disappears into the city crowds once he gets outside.. The stairs leading up to the second floor are notoriously creaky and squeaky. Lately no one has been willing to stay at the inn because the stairs creak and squeak in the middle of the night. No one has been seen going up and down the stairs at the time and rumors of the inn being haunted are causing problems.. When the PCs try to get a room the owner is at the front desk doing the accounting. Observant and intelligent PCs can notice that hes made an error in his calculations. If the PCs tell him about the mistake they can save him GP and get an upgraded room for the night as his way of saying thanks.  Too bad its the Honeymoon Suite.. The inn has several small locked closets and rooms that are marked Employees only  no admittance in several languages. If the PCs break in they find each of the rooms contain large quantities of a different and seemingly worthless objects. Examples include rooms filled with several thousand bent iron nails pillows with no stuffing small sticks and branches the lids to crates of various sizes candles that have been  used enough bread to feed a small village if werent old and stale several barrels of saltwater and bags of wooden coins. The staff refuses to discuss the contents of the rooms and will ask persistent PC to leave the inn.. The owner of the inn likes to keep a variety of exotic pets. The rumors the parrots tell are all out of date. He promises the worg by the fireplace hasnt eaten anyone in years. The cozy looking fire in the fireplace is actually a cozy fire snake. Please dont poke the fire snake.. The inn is decorated with a variety of cheap art objects from local nomadic tribal people. Knowledgeable PCs can notice that the ritual mask behind the bar is partly constructed of incredibly valuable phoenix feathers.. The town is recovering from a recent attack by a large group of bandits. Thankfully they repelled the bandits and dont expect them to return soon. The inn is being temporarily used as a hospital for those people injured in the fight. There is room for the PCs but theyll only be allowed to stay at the inn if they volunteer to help tend to the wounded.. The PCs are bothered by several interruptions from the housekeeping staff whenever theyre at the inn. If they complain the management acts confused. They dont have a separate housekeeping staff.. A strange and strong antiseptic smell is coming from the inn offices. If the PCs investigate they find that hidden behind the front office is a room kept cold by magical means. It contains several corpses a large table several books and journals jars of chemicals and a large rack filled with a variety of medical equipment. The owner is an surgeon who is using the corpses to teach himself anatomy. He refuses to tell the PCs the source or identity of the corpses.. One of the waitresses is a reverse kleptomaniac. She frequently and secretly puts random objects into the bags of the PCs. The waitress apologizes when the PC try to order some food. Theyre mysteriously running low on spoons so the inns specialty soup is off the menu that night. The waitress has no knowledge of her condition.. The inn is completely full except for just a few rooms. Unfortunately for the PCs the rooms are designed for small sized creatures. Medium or larger PCs who try to sleep there anyway are not able to get comfortable and are fatigued all day the next day. Small sized PCs find the rooms unusually comfortable and are able to achieve the effects of a full nights rest in half the time.. The inn was designed by a very artistic architect. Every wall door piece of furniture decoration and other features are designed entirely without straight lines or sharp corners.. Each of the employees of the inn bears an uncanny resemblance to dead family members of the PCs. The employees of the inn will think the PCs are strange if they mention the resemblance and extremely creepy if the PCs pursue the matter further.,rpg,cgbj9k1,4,t5_2qh2s

637519,0,t1_cgcokko,If I understand correcltly you mean that each party will have to be online when they play. That wont be the case no. We will have set dates upon which feedback turns official. If a party sends feedback before the designated date the adventure is updated if not it is updated at the next designated date.So if party A has not received any updates by the designated date even though party B is playing at the same area it runs the adventure normally. If on the other hand party B sends their feedback in time they run the adventure updated. If we receive conflicting feedback from the two parties during the time between the two designated dates we resolve the matter on a case by case basis. Regarding the second part of your question a party hunting down other players means initiation of PvP mode. PvP is a large chapter but here is a brief overview of how we deal with it PvP is not pleasant for many players. Our goal is everyone to have fun. So initiating PvP will have antiincentives we are considering several ingame and outofgame alternatives. Bottomline is that PvP will be possible because it can be part of the fun in fact it might be a lot of fun and is essential in a truly living world but the antiincentives will be such to guarantee there wont be anyone initiating it without careful consideration and planning.,rpg,cgcqize,1,t5_2qh2s

745809,0,t1_cgoyieh,Dancey knows a lot of about network externalities but he doesnt know everything about how people move in herds.  Look at his last point in that post you linked to that the players of  are not the players of .  Hidden within that is a pretty big truth the networks people are always in flux coming and going and with those changes ideas change too.DnD is the biggest network but its also the most hoary stodgy stultified and calcified network as well.  Plugging into that network means plugging into a  year history of terms concepts worlds and an evolving rules base that can be frankly daunting.  The DnD network Pathfinder or not has a really high bar for entry.  Part of that is social part of that is history and part of that is the complex rules.  As a GM looking to play as often as I can manage it I can frankly say that it can be a tough sell up front and holds a big learning curve for a new player because of how monolithic it is.No industry can survive long with the only functioning network being that kind of set up.  You need easy entry points and as much as I malign MMO derived rule sets I know that they are that entry point for the time being.  More than anything this industry needs rule sets that are multigenre easy to learn with a lot of expansion power to GET complex even if they arent at the entry point and which have core concepts and terms that can be taught easily and quickly.  You dont need to plug them into a DnD style game today but you most definitely need to hook them and get them started on the path that will eventually lead there.Look at the rise of Savage Worlds from its start in  as a great example.  Youve got a simplified rule set Explorer an expansion point to the full thing Deluxe enough published settings to give GMs and players some pretty good incentive to buy and huge swaths of fanbuilt material providing all sorts of network externalities around the game.  My old gaming group jumped to Savage Worlds almost exclusively after  years of gaming in multiple systems for a reason  we all got kids and wanted to introduce them to the hobby.  Whats easier teaching them DnD or teaching them the  basic concepts they need to make and run a SW character?  Thats a no brainer.Maybe DnD will bring in that entry point for its network new red box could be it perhaps maybe well see upstarts like SW expand their complexity to DnD levels from their entry points ... who knows?  But this industry needs those entry points or its dead long term.Edit Thanks for the gold!  Wheeeeeeeeee!,rpg,cgp1zmc,11,t5_2qh2s

I was a son of Thor.We were making our way through a thick forest in the middle of the night when were suddenly confronted by a Fenrir wolf the size of a Mack truck. Long story short the thing was way too difficult for us we were about to party wipe and our storyteller was on the verge of deusexmachinaing it away before I had a stroke of genius. I stood proud and said If Asmundr cant harm you then I will use Midgard itself as my weapon! Asmundr was the name of my axe. Now as a son of Thor I got the Sky purveiw which is an ability that allowed me to do two things. The first one I used was my ability to fly. I grabbed the Fenrir by the scruff and immediately began to fly upwards in the sky. I flew higher and higher with the behemoth wolf trying to writhe out of my hands until the air was so thin I couldnt go any higher. I then turned around and immediately started flying down towards the ground both the fenrir and I were going head first. I spent Legendary points with storyteller permission to fly faster and faster towards the ground until we broke the sound barrier. Closer and closer we rocketed I was going to annihilate this damn wolf into the earth. This is where the second ability of the Sky purview comes in I spent a legendary point to negate all falling damage for myself. Both the Fenrir and I smashed into the ground with such force that he exploded on impact his flesh and bones scattering all over the surrounding forest. I walked out of the crater covered in Fenrir blood and viscera and spent the rest of the night celebrating with the mead we had on hand and eating fenrir meat. It was glorious.

You need a good reason to make an RPG...it needs to be something you want that doesnt exist yet. Get as much of your game done as you can then as your interest begins to wane release it as a betasneak peak to the public. Get involved in the community. This will keep you motivated to finish the darn thing! Never design in a vacuum  Youre going to change your rules as you work on your game because some of the rules just wont work. If you come across a problem you cant solve look at how others solved the issue. Staring at a blank word document will not provide you with the inspiration you need. Play lots of games and dissect them to see why you enjoy them. Also lots of life experiences help! Listen to your friends  I cant tell you how many times I presented a prototype to my friends only for them to tell me it stinks. I thought my ideas were cool and didnt heed their advice. A year later I came to the same conclusion they did. Save yourself time and listen to what they have to say. Make your game special  I look upon some of the oldschool RPG books with sentimental value and nostalgia. Theres something magical about them to me. Make your own work so good someone else might look upon it with reverence. Even if the only person who does is you at least you aimed high and put a lot of love into it.,rpg,cgrwbxv,4,t5_2qh2s

Do individual players get exp when they take down enemies? Or everyone in the encounter? Does everyone always bring a character sheet for their next level in case they level up?

789239,0,t1_cgtyhc1,How the characters come together is entirely up to you and the party. If it was me in the GMs chair however I would definitely suggest to the group that one or two characters at least know each other. Maybe the rogue and fighter are from the same town  one is the brains and the other the brawn.

I can enjoy a good game of pretty much any game whether it be Microscope Fiasco Fate or old school DampDDungeon Crawl Classic some heavier systems like GURPS and everything in between from RuneQuest to Savage Worlds. It seems the group itself and the general mood is the most important aspect. I guess Im lucky that I can enjoy a classic dungeon crawl as well as more freeform gaming that put the emphasis somewhere else.The Dungeon Crawl doesnt really deserve the bah its for computer game peons thing. There can still be a great sense of exploration mystics characters and wonder in a wellcrafted dungeon. Of course if every room is a x room with stone block walls and the sound of water dripping in the background with random groups of a Minotaur a Dragon and a Lich hanging out together for no reason and boring pit traps and the like... that gets old quickly...I wouldnt make dungeons my only type of gaming but I still get excited when I get the chance to explore something whether it be an abandoned space station or a classic ruin.,rpg,cgu4ha7,1,t5_2qh2s

You could have some npc discover that magic can be used not just by talking to the ancient spirits but also personal manipulation of it start of seeing magic like a wizard class rather than divine class. Maybe the tribes consider this to be preaching heresy and send the party to deal with it. Could have one or two party members discover that they too can use this new form of magic and then see if the party ostracises them or realises that these are not bad people so then this magic is not so bad. Because wizard type magic is based on studies  the things it can do would be simpler. Maybe the players could pioneer some of the foundations of magic. Also if the world is new then the Gods would be young as well so their influence would less than expected.

The Iron Kettle has a value of  meaning that theres very little in terms of wealth here. What does that mean for you as a GM?  Well it could mean that The Iron Kettle is the sort of establishment where commoners go for drinks after a hard days work. Cheap booze  common people  lots of juicy gossip rumors and other useful information. If your players want to find out some dirt on the local nobility The Kettles where theyre going to find it.On the other hand The Blue Bottle is a  joint. This is the kind of place where corrupt politicians make shady deals with wealthy businessmen or where traders in ancient artifacts meet to discuss sales propositions.

850868,0,t3_23sn7b,Generic just means its not tightly bound to the setting.  DampD makes it very hard to play settings which dont feel like DampD  the concept of fighters and wizards is baked into the core.  Likewise you cant really play Mouseguard without being mice.GURPS and Fate Core and FAE and the core World of Darkness and Savage Worlds and BESM are not bound to a specific universe but theyre tied to a very specific style of play.  BESM assumes you have animestyle superpowers but WoD assumes the opposite.  FAE assumes your characters are good at many things within an approach and Fate Core assumes your characters are good at a given skill but both assume that what matters are descriptive terms.  Contrast to GURPS which cares more about the number crunching.I agree its not possible to create a system which handles everything because systems have competing goals.  Some people might find FATE incomplete others might find GURPS too crunchy and full of tables.  You could use either to run a police procedural.To give your example Pokemon vs Death Note vs Mobile Suit Gundam generic RPG systems can help if theyre generic enough.  Pokemon is popular enough  and has enough individual Pokemon  that it could probably use its own system.  Mobile Suit Gundam meanwhile could be handled by a generic RPG system.  Id use BESMs mecha rules for over the top games like Wing and d Mecha for th MS Team.Likewise Death Note could probably be handled rather nicely by a generic RPG as long as the RPG handles the right tone.So to answer your question of do we need more generic systems the answer is yes for the same reason you argued.  No one generic system can handle all genres because even if you step back from the setting you still have to consider the tone.  It is for this reason that we have so many generic systems so that you can find the one which best fits whatever universe you want to run.,rpg,ch0zy01,2,t5_2qh2s

You build small sometimes large when youre lucky die pools based around what action your character is taking.Example  My character Fox who is basically Nightwing with a twist  is perched atop a roof watching two thugs stalk a helpless woman down a long lonely alley. I decide that I would like to do a somersault down onto the crooks shoulders clacking their heads together and landing safely on the ground without disturbing the woman. First you build your die pool in correlation with what you are doing how youre doing it and who youre doing it with.  main categories Affiliations Distinctions Power Sets and Specialties I am Solo so I pull a D for Affiliation I have a plan for a D Distinction Ill be maneuvering through the air with D Airwalking and decide to make sure I give it enough power to add my D Enhanced Strength by paying a PP more on this later! to The WatcherGMUatu FTW and finally Ill add my Acrobatics Master for a final D. Bringing my pool to d d. After you roll you remove any Opportunities dice coming up  pick two dice to create a total and one die to be your Effect Die. Heres where things get interesting you choose an Effect Die based on size of die number doesnt matter. I rolled    on the Ds and   on the Ds. The Watcher pays me a PP for my  to add a D to The Doom Pool. I take the  and  for  and a D effect given that this is a lowrisk easy pickns attack I succeed. Ding! Ding! Clean up on Alley ! But by then it was too late and she was on me...This was a really stripped down low energy situation there are PLENTY more awesome rules involving Plot Points PP currency that you gain through Opportunities or other risky situations but can spend on adding more dice to your pool activating The Watchers Opportunities and other fun stuff Character Creation The Doom Pool and on and on!Ive evaded SHIELD Cape Killers battled The Red Skull in a fireconsumed Asgard matched wits with Loki for innumerable sessions...Ive seen what this system can do and it is beautiful.,rpg,ch13f63,1,t5_2qh2s

Finally there was a large lake in the middle that made traversing from one side to the other easier via boats in summer or ice sleds in winter  it also meant we could have pirates and ship battles and the like.Im not sure what made it so fun. Probably the superharsh winter painting a rough hue over everything but it worked out well. Plus by having the region bound by geography as well as politics it meant that conflicts could be as complicated as wars breaking out and courtly intrigue or as simple as damn is it cold and you need to get to the next town before nightfall or you will probably freeze.,rpg,chcb0hd,2,t5_2qh2s

Is it possible for a god to sin against their domain? They are kind of the final authority right?What if the DM sort of does a poll of each of the Gods in the campaign setting for that domain? If the general result approves of the characters person in light of their recent actions character may keep within that domain on the alignment chart. Surely this old chart cant fit every single player or DMs expectations?Another alternative would be to consider cosmic poles like Nature as additional axes on the alignment chart.  I confess I hate alignment as it existsWhat we are talking about attempts to transcend contemporary human morality almost like something from a Lovecraft story. A DM kind of has to decide where the outside boundaries of reality arrive in their setting though.In real life Yes its evil.

1014708,0,t3_25pp0k,I have some suggestions and I feel there must be some distinctions madeSeparate the character from the player.  A character may be shy or even mute but please dont be that way as a player.  Most games Ive played are not fully in character so you can ask questions make comments or attempt things as a player even if your character is brooding in the corner.Ask questions.  The DM has to describe everything but things get left out.  A secret lever in a room is no secret if all of a sudden I add that that specific room has intricate candelabras on the walls the DM may not want to draw too much attention to things.  Or even the DM may not have thought of something until you ask.  My players ask me all the time if I had planned everything the answer is often no  because they ask interesting questions that shape their world.Think outside the box.  In a dungeon my players killed a bunch of giant fire beetles.  I described how their blood glowed and one of my players gathered some of it in a jar.  Later the melee characters were getting eaten alive by swarms of cockroaches and that character attempted to use the blood to stave off the swarms.  I hadnt thought of it before that moment  but I liked it!  So I made it work. Be an assertive player who thinks about the fiction before the rules.  Its the DMs job to interpret the rules.  I had a player who always wanted to attack things unconventionally.  Either with improvised objects or with interesting attack moves not talked about in the book.  At first he was too nervous to ask if he could do it because the rules dont say how.  But once he got the hang if it his characters always did the coolest stuff  because he played beyond I hit it with my sword.also take action!  Nothing kills the momentum like the player who always waits to see how things turns out.  If the players are always waiting to see how the bar brawl ends or how the battle ends or how the debate ends before doing anything.  Then its just the DM RPing with himself.  See the story as an opportunity to be an active player not just a reactive survivor.,rpg,chjmo8z,3,t5_2qh2s

1033264,0,t3_25xb8d, Had a DM once give us a campaign partly inspired by Shrek. There was a supernatural plague going around and we went on a massive quest to hunt for the cure. Eventually we were told we would have to steal very rare flowers  red flowers blue thorns theres your Shrek reference!  from the dungeon of a sorcerer who had hoarded them all long ago. And just like in Shrek this turned out to only be a diversion. The person who sent us on this errand was actually behind the plague and was hoping his evil schemes would net him tens of thousands of zombie minions all while us pesky adventurers were delving through this dungeon.   Had a DM give us a bizarre campaign that was a mashup between Jurassic Park Godzilla and Starship Troopers. After one quest the king rewarded us with our very own tropical paradise island! Naturally we went to go check it out and found to our somewhat expected disappointed that the island was absolutely overrun with horrific enormous beasts primarily dinosaurs and massive bugs. An experiment gone awry similar to a spill of radioactive material had caused all this to happen.    Had a DM attempt a campaign based on the anime One Piece. Long story short Anime does not translate well to Dungeons amp Dragons.   Had a DM attempt  several times in a row unsuccessfully  to run a campaign based off the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Castlevania. The DM had collaborated with a player in secret and wanted that player to be a vampire and turn on the group at a key point in the campaign. Hilariously the characters got into a fight early on and the vampire character was stabbed through the heart with a wooden stake beheaded placed in a box and buried  just like Vlad the Impaler. And the kicker was NONE of that was intentional... the rest of us had no idea what the source material was for the campaign all we knew was that it had a horror theme and so we had things like wooden stakes on hand. When the fight broke out we all rolled really well which is how the vampire character wound up being stabbed through the heart AND beheaded. We couldnt stop laughing after the DM and the player explained everything... but we had to stop trying the campaign because now it was just too funny.   I once tried running a campaign based on popular postapocalyptic movies such as The Book of Eli and The Road. Unfortunately the rest of my group arent as big of fans of the genre as I am. Sigh.   Once had a guest DM try running an alternatehistory WWI campaign for us. It was an interesting concept because he was basically trying to pose the question What would WWI have been like if the Germans had orcs while the British had elves? And except for the fantasy element of magic orcs and elves he was trying to be as realistic as possible using WWI research as source material. Unfortunately we were never able to finish that campaign.,rpg,chlqjg7,4,t5_2qh2s

Its robust there are advanced rules all over the place covering everything from how to construct a cyber brain to buying a hindrance that is situational and only affects one of your arms.And innovative ... well thats really a time dependent quality no?  We might consider something from  years ago innovative for the time but playedout and common or even obsolete today.For someone not familiar with the system GURPS has plenty of innovative qualities that are refreshing coming from a DnD world.  For example the ability to default almost any action based upon how hard it is when you are unskilled at it a wizard can pick up a sword and try and break open the locked chest with it.  Point buy system.  The bell curve dice.And if you want crunch for things that other systems dont consider because they are set in fantasy medieval lands like how much better is my sniper skill if I have a scope or what is the effect if I decide to walk and shoot or run and shoot and does it matter if Im blamming away full auto on a gun with a lot of muzzle climb ... etc. etc. etc.Maybe youre thinking that we need to be mentioning systems that are funky trippy experimental or niche by way of being modern and innovative.Well you can play Dogs in the Vineyard.

Wanted to post this just because I really wanted to run it and cant really share with anyone I might DM for in case I do get the chance to use it.Simply I wanted to run a quest that takes place inside the mind of someone. It was also going to tie into a preexisting story pretty heavily and be a major turning point of the campaign. If anyone has read through the Shattered Star adventure path no spoilers dont worry I was originally running that AP and went off the tracks to make my own stuff. The goal was the same collect all  macguffin shards and several NPCs stuck around the pathfinder lady you meet at the start Shiela.The players were at a lull in the main adventure doing several side quests until Shiela determined the location of the next fragment. Basically each shard points to the next shard so that ..gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt... In this down time my players did a handful of different things including helping the poor and one player decided to get to know the local government.During another average month they get a message from their noblefriend that he needs their help. His personal artist and very close friend has fallen gravely ill and has been stuck in a fitful coma for several days and nothing will wake him. PCs arrive and try to figure out what happened  eventually they discover an amulet that is tied to this. What they learn is that the artist bought this amulet saying only that it would help him become the best artist in the world! The next day he was in that coma. More research on the amulet reveals that it is actually something that lets you travel into dreams but the magic has been cursed somehow. It is revealed the only way to undo it would be to enter the dream as well. The noble of course offers large amounts of gold to help his friend.They travel to the artists dreams. Queue a broken dreamscape with fragments of different locations melded together  an idyllic field quickly shifts into a beachside view or a barren landscape. The only thing that remains static is a single building old and dilapidated.Inside this building is a long unending hall with hundreds of doors. Each door corresponds to a memory  good memories are described in really wonderful ways with beautiful scenery. Bad memories have become twisted and nightmare like especially early memories. This could lead to encounters vs a powerful demonic wolf  the artist had an early childhood experience with a wolf and since then has had a growing fear of animals. Similarly encounters vs the environment itself can be had. Lots of room for creative combat.Eventually they will come to a room that opens up into a huge meadow  the scene immediately changes to a gorgeous waterfall  and then a tranquil pond and so on. The environment keeps changing and changing and the thing that stays static is the artist sitting on a stool in the center of the environment with a large painters easel in front of him. He is constantly painting but the easel is just covered in random swatches and strokes as every time the environment changes he begins painting the new environment.As the PCs try to rouse him from his trance a demon appears. He was the one who A disguised himself to sell the artist the cursed amulet B is the one trapping him and C is not going to let the PCs spoil his plan.Queue fight with very powerful demon too powerful to beat  the artist snaps out of it and the group should try to start running from the demon.In addition an optional bit is if you have players whose characters you understand pretty well motivations fears etc you can run this bit the PC might get hit with a spell or whatever that causes them to experience their worst fear in terrifying detail  attacked by spider enslaved family killed whatever. Mess with players heads a bit. For example if theres a barbarian that always kills first and never asks questions put him in a nightmare where there is an enemy and the only way to escape is to not kill the enemy  after several rounds of not attacking the nightmare fades. Helps tie the PCs into the adventure. The nightmares can feel long but in reality they are only a couple seconds long.We have to get out of here A PC will probably say. Where can we go?! Another might respond. However it comes up the artist or a PC will bring up trying to hide from the Demon. The artist will frantically look around and choose a random memory door. Inside after shutting the door the group will find themselves in a dark forest. The memory is blurry at first. The artist doesnt remember it  I just wanted somewhere that that thing couldnt find us. It is a deep suppressed memory from the artists childhood  the group sees the artist as a child with his father walking through this forest. Child wants to go home play elsewhere and do general child things. The father shushes him and says there is something very important he must do first. As the scene progresses the memory gets sharper as the artist starts to remember.The father and son come to a rock wall and the father places his hand on the wall. It begins to open. Father tells child to wait at entrance and goes into the opening. Child peeks into cavern  the father is placing a macguffin shard on a pedestal gasp! this sidequest is plot relevant?!?! Father comes out and casts a spell to obfuscate this memory from the child artist this explains why it was forgotten.Demon finds the memory  he has been looking for this specific one the entire time but couldnt find it now. He sarcastically thanks the PCs for all their help and poof vanishes. The artist and PCs soon wake up.Now they are competing with the demon on getting all the shards first. They race to that cave demon gets there first. Mocks them says hes going to pay Shiela a visit this shard pointed to one of the shards the PCs already found!PCs return to Shiela she is dead all the shards they had found are gone. All they find is Shielas notes on where the next shard is. They now have to find the remaining  first and then steal back the  from the demon.The reason I didnt get to run it was because literally  session before I was going to run it one of the PCs murders the other in a duel and they both decide to reroll characters one player left the campaign due to time reasons and another one joined  I really wanted to do the whole PC fearsnightmares but I had no idea what the  new characters were like so I delayed. Campaign died before I got to do quest.If you read through youre real cool. Hopefully you enjoyed my long winded answer and hope it inspires you to do a cool adventure.,rpg,chpruz5,2,t5_2qh2s

1081067,0,t3_26hmvy,Alright so pretty much everything you know from video game RPGs will hurt more than help.So the basic game works like this a player character wants to see if they can do something steal a gem attack an orc convince a king whatever but its kinda boring if the PC can just autoeverything so you want to add a little bit of randomness into it to make things more exciting. Thats where the dice come in. So you roll a twenty sided dice which is called a d a six sided dice is called a d an eight sided dice is a called d and so on. Theres a reason for that but Ill get to that later. So lets say your trying to steal a gem and so you roll the d and you get a . Now that would normally not do well it being a small number but your character is a thief so that means they should be pretty good at stealing stuff so that means you get a  to your roll. Meaning that you take the  that you roll and add  to it making it an  which should be good enough and your character steals the gem.So you need a bit of codification of why a thief gets a  to stealing things otherwise everyone gets  to everything and its no fun. So every character has  different ability scores which are used to describe the character strength constitution wisdom dexterity charisma and intelligence which all have pretty self explanatory shortened version. So this specific thief has a  to their dexterity and some other stuff which can be learned from the book itself. Theres a base score and an ability score where the ability score the  is taken from the base score. But its convoluted and for the most part irrelevant and there are more mediate level stuff on So theres another part to actually doing things which is the skills part. So because DnD likes compartmentalizing to do anything you dont roll off the ability score you actually roll something called a skill to do things. Like stealing the gem would be thievery and you can put points into a skill. Thats where the  is coming from that you add to the ability score  so you add  to the roll.Theres just one last terminology thing that you should understand and thats when someone says d. All that means is that you roll  six sided dice and add them up. You can also do fun stuff like dd because they are just random numbers.Thats the real basics of how DnD works mechanically attacking is another thing but if you understand this you can probably work though everything else. Dont be afraid to do voices as well having the goblin have a different voice from the giant may seem silly but it honestly makes the world of a difference.Other than that good luck and good gaming!

I didnt feel like playing a sorcerer or a wizard was really that different because the only real choice was spontaneous vs prepared casting and having a spellbook. In pathfinder that gets expanded. Plus in . making one character of a class different than another relied on either feats or gamebreaking prestige classes. The addition of more things for virtually every class most of which are a choice and archtypes in preference of PrCs fixed the power differential between people who stuck with their class and those who went with a PrC and also made it so my character can be very different from an ally of the same class or a previous character. I would never argue PF is a better system for newbies but it is definitely better than .. Pathfinder is a game for people who enjoy complexity with lots of different possibilities for character creation while maintaining a balance between players. Also while pathfinder PCs are more powerful so are enemies and monsters. Pretty much everything has either a reduce CR or has been beefed up to be much more intimidating.

Are they old friends or new and awkward comrades?. Have them introduce their characters to each other at the start of session. It helps them get into character.

If you decide to see how far you can take this choose a bunch of reliable people you like who may be interested in running games and get them to run a one off of Pathfinder a system they know. Give them some basic ideas and stress how this is just for fun they arnt supposed to be polished your doing this because then youre not under as much stress and the fun in the group will increase that way it shakes everything up.If you want you could supervise for a session and just run about problemsolving but dont make it a job. They will be rubbish but its one offs.  If all the people have characters or pregens then so what if theyre in one world one week and another the next if they want somthing better tell them to step up to the plate.

This side of the force would see things more in shades of grey and like I mentioned earlier would look towards a long term goal. They would take prophecies very seriously. Yoda is a pretty good example of someone that live in the future as the present.On the otherhand you have the Living Force which usually ties in with life midichlorians etc and interprets the duality of the force Dark side and Light side. They live more in the moment with nature and are more focused at the task in hand.

1155130,0,t3_27awcf,Sorry late to the party. I have found that the ABSOLUTELY most critical part of DMing happens before the game starts. In my last campaign I made it a point to give each of my players an idea of the story similar to the back of a book that gives you an idea of a story but doesnt give away the story. In doing so I told them things like think of the plot like Harry Potter you are students but will be investigating the overarching plot after hours and this is going to be a downtoearth game where you are going to struggle with even the simplest things like feeding yourselves. But more importantly than informing them I asked them if that sounded like a game that they would want to play. On the one hand you get to find out in advance if the game you want to run is something that they want to play but there is also a playerfaith that comes out of it that each session is feeding a story that they have an idea of. There was one instance where I was really losing a player and he was complaining to another the second player took it upon himself to explain that by some of the early on DM actions and the discussion we had already had that it was clear that the players were equipped to exact revenge on the asshole NPC when the time was right. Sure enough this was the case but it speaks volumes when you have players standing up for the DM during the week between games. Got a little off topic but I cant stress early communication enough.

Label a char with keeping in mind a high stat andor skill for people that are good at things and you usually will get close.Should have done that s are the easiest things to visualize for most people.Yeah I agree theres not a lot of scifi stuff. I did do more complex guns rules in another document. Basically different damages for different cartridges people told me on k and reddit gun forums that damage should be based mostly on caliber. Actually changed the breast plate to be equal to full plate. Chain shirt should probably be at least a little quieter since its just a shirt. But yeah youre right its not a big deal. EDIT and yes you are right on the skills I didnt include a lot of scifi ones. I realize now that I didnt even include any social skills so I might have to fix that. I just didnt want too huge of a skill list. Any more you can elaborate on how I should do guns I would appreciate. I will say the Xd thing for the shotgun has been changed I made it dice where you roll a die and reroll s or s to see how many pellets hit and each deal  dice. Its a bit slow but you only fire  shot per round with most shotguns so it should be ok. Also made rate of fire by weapon like AK gets  shots a round M gets  something high rate of fire like an UZi or P gets . Dunno if youre much of a gun geek or whatever. Ill probably reformat it a bit as I go forward to include a little more modern stuff.And yeah thanks a ton for the feedback I think its mostly workable it just needs a few finishing touches before I leap headlong into making a bestiary for it.,rpg,ci0uwwb,1,t5_2qh2s

It is incorrect to then say thats how the game was designed. Handing out XP rewards after a section of a module a story arc as you say is a concession of the format of adventure modules. The core rules were pretty clear that XP could be rewarded during an adventure. It was always possible to gain a level in the middle of a session.

1194613,0,t1_ci3otaa,...bbbut open rolls are so much fun!Of note regarding the shield I believe each time the shield gets hit it takes the full damage value of the weapon not multiplied by the difference in attackdefense as it usually would be.  So even if it is just nicked  times with a  Damage weapon thats  damage.  Shields are one of the trickier parts of magic to understand until then it can make characters seem invincible but theres plenty of ways to get around it.  I suggest that if you dont want the GM munchkining which makes all the other PCs seem underwhelming? as a result of your munchkined character stop munchkining your character.  If the only broken part of your wizard is said shield work with your GM and see if you can demunchkin your wizard in exchange for him to not have to munchkin to make challenges anymore.Perhaps establish a houserule where when the GM showcases the PC receives a Showcase point he can spend to showcase something later.The problems initially seem to revolve around the GM but Id rather not crucify him entirely here.  There seems to be a mentality of GMs muchkining vs Players munchkining.  Im not saying this is you specifically either you seem to have a decent grasp of whats going on at the table.  The GM could be showcasing as a result of some internal issue blindness to what is being expected of him insecurity perhaps lacking social skills I dont know.  It could also be how the players treat the GM as an enemy instead of a friend.  I feel the best and therefore always my goal outcome of a session is for the players and GM to all have had fun.  Every single rule and roll can be thrown out the window any time we see fit if it keeps the game fun.Also I feel like you should try GMing and let your current GM have a seat on the players side of the table.  He sounds like a fine guy who wants to have fun playing like the rest of yall.edit On the note of electronics.  If it is a players turn and he is distracted with texting or whatever the other players and GM are annoyed at the delay he forfeits his turn instantly or on a quick    countdown from the GM.

You can give the players an illusion of choice but whichever route they choose needs to lead them to the end. Do not bury clues or resources too deep in fact make them embarrassingly obvious.

Movement and positioning is also an optimization minigame since so many statuses are linked to positioning or movement on the map. Midway through the Heroic tier combat just bogs down completely Ive had four experienced players need  minutes to beat an encounter.In order for E combat to actually be fast you need to add in a bunch of home rules. I maximize damage and have monsters retreat or surrender when bloodied. If you want to keep rolled damage you can minionize monsters and have them drop to  HP once they are bloodied. Its also best to rebuild all monsters using the Monster Manual  formulas and addenda,rpg,ci651vl,3,t5_2qh2s
1215870,0,t1_ci5tw0l,Alright lets think about it this way then combat is too long for how much fun it yields. I think youd agree. But this actually presents two solutions not just one because thinking about it in this way gives us two variables fun and time not just time.And this makes sense I think. If youre having a really great fight you probably wouldnt mind if it took an hour. But if the fight is boring in this case it seems to be boring for you because nothing important read nothing that changes the expected outcome seems to be happening at least thats how I read tons of damage without dying is boring it cant go quickly enough you just want it to be over.So in the first place I think you are after not just the fastest combat out there but rather a faster resolution of boring combat. The alternate solution isnt to go faster but to make it more enjoyable. Whether games like Pathfinder are capable of supplying enjoyable combat for you Im not sure but keep in mind thats an option you seemingly havent explored.So keeping that in mind where are we at?To begin with definitely consider what uCrossP has to say the system can only do so much. The difference between me playing an atlevel th edition DampD combat against my last group of players and me playing an atlevel th edition DampD combat against myself running both monsters and PCs is the difference between an hour and  minutes its gigantic. Believe me I wanted to know what was taking so long and I checked. That said if the systems combat is playing slowly because the players arent paying attention because its boring the system is definitely the root cause and a change is definitely in order.uOshojabe mentions monster morale too and this is something that often lies outside the system usually as GM you decide when monsters run rarely these days are there morale rules included. The reason the baddies running away at low morale is good is because the conclusion to the fight is usually obvious at that point PCs win taking marginal extra damage. You want something with high potential lethality probably because this foregone conclusion effect makes fights really boring and itd be better if the option for a reversal was always open. Simply skipping the last round of a fight not only saves you probably about ten minutes a not insignificant chunk of time as far as DampD fights go but it also cuts off the least interesting part of the fight. It both improves average fun and reduces average time which means its a good strategy to help with what youre after.With those two big things out there here are some notable DampD and DampD spinoffs and how they affect combat speed and more subjectively fun levels Basic DampD Labyrinth Lord Swords amp Wizardry Combat is pretty low on options outside of improvised actions which makes it pretty bland a lot of the time but its simplicity and small HP numbers means it tends to move along briskly with lots of important read stuff dying things happening each round. Unfortunately hirelings and often large numbers of monsters means that while a lot happens in a fight the fights themselves often arent much shorter. Descending AC slows things down a little but not really too big a deal. st edition ADampD nd edition ADampD OSRIC Offers more complex combat options although most people play without using them because they usually arent worth the time. Same descending AC as before. Otherwise very similar to above. rd edition DampD . edition DampD Pathfinder This branch youre probably already familiar with. Combat can be volatile at low levels but at mid and high levels slows down a lot. Tons of rules means tons of options which can be fun for some people but many options are nonviable meaning theres a lot of false choices which reduces the options on paper to few options in practice. Combat is quite slow people complain about it a lot. th edition DampD Combat a smidge faster than rd but people still complain about it a lot. Way more viable options though which means if crunching numbers optimally is your thing youve got way more fun here than in previous versions. However it has even less variable outcomes than earlier versions did which means if the potential for major shifts in board state are your thing which seems to be your case this probably isnt the best solution at least not out of the box. th edition DampD I havent played this since the first playtest packet so honestly I cant give a really good overview here but from what I saw it was more spritely than rd or th but probably a bit slower than basic or st without the extra bits added on. It promises to offer adjustable complexity which might be good for you wanting more interesting fights that offer more variance but we just dont know for sure yet since the game isnt out. Dungeon Crawl Classics A spinoff game with relatively low HP values and thus high variance with a bunch of random result tables and thus even higher variance. Combat takes probably between the length of basic DampD and rd edition DampD but a lot of zany things happen as a result of the randomness involved which might appeal to you since they can often dramatically alter the board state. Dungeon World A DampD spinoff in flavor but definitely not in rules. Relatively low HP totals compared to damage means big swings can happen even at high levels and the way combat plays out means that unexpected things happen all the time. The fights seem to often take slightly longer than basic DampD but again this is because a lot more stuff is happening. Theyre generally still faster than rd or th as DCCRPG was.There are more retroclones and spinoffs out there but I think those last  are going to be the most promising for you. They offer a good blend of combat that is both faster than modern DampD rdpathfinderth and is less predictable than modern DampD. Marginal adjustments of both fun and time I think will probably get you better results than just slashing time as low as it can go.,rpg,ci6ejqw,2,t5_2qh2s

I dont think there is a need to write an essay on anything to RP this.One of the chief upsides of any kind of fictional endeavor is that you can entertain ideas and possible courses of action without harming anyone save cases of previous traumas among the involved. Even an imperfect attempt of this kind of roleplay can lead to an increased empathy for people with the condition as well as related learning if the roleplayer really invests into it.But the worst case scenario is that it might not be very fun.

By the end of it hed found comrades hes willing to at least risk his life for and also a lifestyle hes happy with. We all serve the emperor in our own way. I like to imagine him eventually becoming an Inquisitor and commanding his own unit. Hed be a very pragmatic and rather lenient Inquisitor especially to common people caught in the midst of things but hed have little mercy for criminals as hes fully aware of what k underworld criminals are capable of doing.Remi  A swordswoman wandering the lands with her old uncle. After leaving the campaign cuz it ended. She was on a quest to find a cure for her people who were cursed by a Demon. Id like to think that she went back on the road with her uncle to continue her quest and shed still be flaunting her skills around she was very boastful and beating up thugs.Theodore Elma Irons  A psychopath paedophile serial killer assassin mage. One fucked up individual hired for an ultra secret mission with a party just as crazy as him A Raksasha hunter a vengeance obsessed elven shadowdancer a human psychic created by experiments by Iuz god of disease and Neural God of madness and a priest of Neural Who turned out to be Neural himself. The mission oddly enough was to save the world wut.. My character who was in denial of his nature and always justifying his actions as punishing bad people. The Priest of Neural helped him concile with his madness. As the campaign closed we sorta kinda succeeded in our mission my character had come to accept it but decided to go travel around for a while before joining Neural.Now the catch with Theodore is that as part of the mission his body is now permamently that of a  year old girl. What is he going to do? Why explore this new crazy side of him. Probably in some city maybe the one the other PC group build? Muhahaha. If not caught Nigh impossible with his abilities unless its an equally skilled mage hed probably join Neural eventually.Varus The Magus a megalomaniac summoner. Not a bad guy just a bit full of it and doesnt take shit from anyone. Hes insanely clever as well. Campaign ended because player attrittion. Varus is probably busy being ambitious as hell until someone has enough of his shit and stabs him in the neck.A  year campaign is coming to an end next month. The characters if they dont die will not get closure as another campaign in the same setting but different PCs will start then. Long history behind this one but lets just say hes a th level militia boy who ended up founding an island and a Magic Knights Order think Jedi in fantasy. The final chapter we are in has us defending the island against an invading force which has qualitative and quantitative advantage over our forces. Its a desperate battle. Hes also hiding his wife who had betrayed him and stolen his wealth and ruined his reputation and was eventually captured by the enemy and then tortured until he paid her ransom which was his own magical sentient weapon. Shes wanted by almost most governments in the world except for one empire but only because she hasnt been there yet even our PCs island.If we succeed I like to think that he will continue his role on the island but also would help his wife recover shes almost a cripple after torture and then give her the choice and capability to relocate to the one place where she is not wanted for some crime to disappear. If she has a change of heart for some reason hell do everything he can to help her reconcile and repent including magicalclerical means using his personal connections and hiring the best lawyers.No one said hes good with women or that he is very wise p,rpg,ciaj74u,2,t5_2qh2s

If there is something not being said but manifesting via the characters the player will tell you and the rest when they feel the time is right. If there isnt anything then this is just how they play.

I meant more realism in that in DampD as a starting character you might have  or maybe  hp basic gear know a few tricks etc but years down the road you know a plethora of spells and tricks have  hp can do enough damage to destroy a castle wall in two swings etc. Basically the levels of power are very HIGH fantasy.In Shadowrun you might start with basic gear know a few tricks and  hp and years down the road you have a ton of gear know a lot of powerful spells know some incredible tricks and have...maybe  or  hp. Meaning for all your tricks and armour and such if you get caught without preparation or in a bad situation even a lowlevel street ganger with an uzi can kill you.Now thats just one aspect of the game and the magic curve and cybertechnology and such definitely goes into crazy mode later on so youre partly right about the realism bit.

Perhaps you lead them on to thinking that theres actually an entire cult or group of people in the town that are betraying them and you can lead them on a merry chase of trying to find out whos in on it since everyone seems to have airtight alibis.Then it turns out its the goddamn shapeshifter the one person mayor or whatever whos been encouraging them to route out the conspiracy the one person theyve never seen associating with the demons the one person who also seems to occasionally be mysteriously absent when shit goes down.Bonus points make it the mayors aide or secretary. Someone like that has access to all the plansinfo etc without actually being in the spotlight. That and people tend to overlook the help. A good way to have them be present without drawing attention to them heres this unimportant character let me spend  minutes describing him! you can fake them out by having him appear to be the Alfred to the Mayors Adam West in Family Guy. Or something essentially the mayors is this big bluff person who is full of energy and makes all these plans and then says to the aide Set it up will you? without really giving any details or hints on how hes supposed to set it up.You can even have the aide appear to be defensiveprotective of the Mayor if any of the PCs trash talk him or make fun of him in the aides presence. Make him seem like a slave to formalityhierarchyorder. Noble suffering servant jah jah jah?edit Actually with him being an aide its the perfect way to describe him and drop hints and not be obvious. Have the PCs wait to meet the mayor first the aide has to vet them and then the sit and wait while he does paperwork. Make it seem like hes the implacable office guardian while the mayor is having a conversation with someone in his office. If they try to listen in have him reprimand them and drop a hint like saying I know my place its right here keeping a proper schedule.

Turn slow cooker on low.Wait  hours.Tasty Korean BBQ for everyone.I did this a couple weeks ago and it went over great.   fed everyone at the table with food to spare.But that was just my turn.  We set it up so we rotate responsibility.  Each person in the group has a responsibility and that responsibility rotates every week.  For example.  Provide food..  Wash dishes used by group.  Clean up all the crap the group has left behind and take out the trash..  Break down the game table and put the furniture back into place..  Assist in the table breakdown its BIG but other than that youve got the week off..  Relax youve got this week off too.Each player  I take one too  is assigned a role.  Each week the role rotates.  If the food is particularly expensive everybody will chip in  but usually the dinner is something cheap.I instituted this rule since my house was always trashed after a game session.  Now the rule is that the house looks like it did when the game started or theres no game the subsequent week.  The chore rotation makes it so that cleanup only takes  minutes or so.

The other is almost instantaneous to resolve. And they both do the same thing. Functionally they are identical.gtA partially failed perception check still allows interaction with the situationSo what youre saying is roll the dice but then give them the info anyway but use your judgment as to how much. Im saying that the die roll is completely irrelevant. You have to give some info so that the game can be played and you have to use your judgement as to how much.gtSimilarly for lying to or trying to determine the truth of a statement from an encountered individual. Remember that a character might be much better at this than the player or vice versa so player skill at determining truth or lie is insufficient. Actually evidence shows that people are pretty universally bad at this. So its not a skill that needs to be in the game.gtIt must be fun though to never miss a relevant clue because the GM feeds it up on a plate or to never be able to get a particular clue because the GM doesnt feel your background or whatever is sufficient to be able to obtain it.Thats not at all what Im saying and you know it.,rpg,cj3w1pp,1,t5_2qh2s

1507170,0,t1_cj56rtc,Not really.  Dont think of them in terms of buffs or debuffs.Aspects are just well aspects of characters or the environment. They can be either beneficial or hazardrous depending on how its being used and whos using it.  Rotten With Age for instance is an Aspect that could describe a fighting platform a giant tree or a person and in all three the Aspect would be invoked or compelled differently.  Everything in FATE is contextual and serves to advance the ingame fiction.  It is not a simulationist system but a narrative one.If youre fighting on a platform that is Rotten With Age a player may invoke the Aspect to stomp with his giant mech and create massive holes that litter the face of the battlefield.  Or his enemy may do that with a power hammer.  Or a bomb may cause the entire platform to collapse when the GM invokes the Aspect.  If a character is Rotten With Age it may be compelled against him to encourage him to accept a bribe.  Or maybe it means that hes literally rotten because hes enslaved to Nurgle chaos god of rot and disease and the Aspect can be invoked by the character himself to bind a nurgling to his will.If a giant tree was Rotten With Age a player may invoke that Aspect in order to chop it down more easily with his chainsaw.  Or maybe he needs to argue with nearby workers and can invoke the Aspect to convince them that its a safety hazard and it needs to go.  Or he can maybe invoke it to summon the grumpy old spirit of the tree with a magical ritual.Consequences are Aspects that have a distinctly negative slant to them.  Yes theyre the closest thing to a debuff but even then its not really one.  If you have the Open Leg Fracture Consequence after falling from a rooftop while chasing after a pickpocket theres a good chance that the Consequence will slowly worsen if not looked after becoming an Infected Open Leg Fracture Infected Compound Fracture and eventually Amputee.  While you have the Consequence an enemy can maybe make a check to Create An Advantage against you perhaps during the fight he notices that youre favouring a leg.  Now he gets a free invoke against your Consequence allowing him to kick at your wounded leg and deal a shitton of damage when he uses the invoke.In FATE just remember the narrative fiction comes first.  Everything is designed to serve that.  You dont roll dice to see if you pass or fail you roll dice to determine how dramatic the outcome is and what direction that drama will take.,rpg,cj5764i,5,t5_2qh2s

1536761,0,t3_2bsyce,I could be wrong about this so take my advice with a grain of salt. I really would like someone to counter me on this but this is what my experiences have taught me...If your players specifically asked for this a campaign of selfdiscovery then youre fine. Keep going. If they did not I would sadly suggest that you save any notes youve made stow them away and start from scratch. In my experience campaigns with underlying themes like this are generally not suited to RPGs even though they sound very intriguing. By its very nature a story with such themes requires a heavily structured narrative written with the goal of evoking these themes. Unfortunately by their very natures the stories that get told by RPGs are very unpredictable as they are written cooperatively by many different players with different motivations and goals. The stories that your players will remember with fondness will not be the adventure plotlines but more likely the unexpected events that were caused by fateful die rolls harebrained schemes and other unexpected unplanned twists and turns.Of course this is based off of my experience playing in and attempting and failing to run such campaigns. It is of course entirely possible that the DMs involved including me were simply not skilled enough or that the players involved were not suited to such a game. TLDR Only run this idea if you are confident that you and your players can work together as a cohesive cooperative unit with this goal in mind.,rpg,cj8wpqc,3,t5_2qh2s

1627850,0,t3_2cwijz,Im going to run counter to the common CoC wisdom because I think its wrong.  Lovecrafts works were never splatterpunk.  Theyre not brimming with death and disaster and immediate doom.  In almost every Lovecraft story Ive read the hero survives and in all of them the narrator survives.  Most of the time they dont even go insane.  Usually the person who dies is an insane villain who is trying to kill the hero like Horror in the Museum or some background character who kicks off the story such as the Call of Cthulhu or At the Mountains of Madness.Lovecrafts stories arent about heroes pulling out shotguns and dying while defiantly trying to stop the rise of Cthulhu or while pointlessly fighting shoggoths.  Theres exactly one shoggoth that appears At the Mountains of Madness and the heroes just run the fuck away as well they should I mean OMFGSo the way you run a Lovecraftian game where everyone survives is to run it pretty much the way Lovecraft wrote it.  Lovecrafts stories are more about exploration than action.  Your characters stand at the base of cyclopean ruins.  Their fingers trace over the stonecut murals that depict monstrous inhuman figures and their bizarre mindbending technology.  They uncover conspiracies created by madmen who misguidedly worship a malign god who doesnt give a crap about them.  The find themselves confronted with the dawning horror of alien miscegenation.And thats the point.  Once youve uncovered all this stuff and glimpsed the fourdimensional edge of the mythos you run away or it just eyes you for a second and shuffles away and thats it.  Theres nothing to survive because the mythos doesnt care about you so it doesnt crush you.  It might leave you absolutely mad after that glimpse and it will certainly do horrible things to you if you dont do the sensible thing and run when the monster shows up and thats it.But most gamers want to fight.  They come from DampD or some actionadventure game and theres nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps they dont find slow introspective literature written in the s to be to their taste and want more pulp heroics set in a lovecraftian backdrop but at the same time they want the impossibility of the lovecraftian mythos which creates the conundrum of I cant both be a hero and survive fighting this vast mythos.You can do as uFelanWolfe suggests or you can do this You cant beat the mythos.  The point though isnt trying to beat the mythos.  Thats like getting mad at entropy.  Fighting Azazathoth is like trying to beat up the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.  You cant do it.  But you can kill deep ones. You might kill a single shoggoth as a huge team effort involving... I dont rightly know actually.  Most games Ive played that featured a shoggoth made them unkillable.  You can certainly kill Elder things.  And you can absolutely kill cultists.So a heroic lovecraftian story might go something like this For whatever reason your group has ended up in a nice sleepy village.  It brims with charming NPCs like the sweet pretty young woman who runs the local hotel with her brighteyed sister or the salty old sailor who once had a twinkle in his eye but now drinks too much or the collegeeducated young man who has returned to the town to try to improve its ailing economy.  And of course there are the villains perhaps some wicked and perverted priest whose madness has begun to infect the disenfranchised of the town.  It starts as a  basic power struggle especially given his unwholesome intentions towards the attractive hotelowner.    Then the conflict turns violent and some of the followers of the priest have been twisted but there are other things that have joined them that have begun wearing the skins of the dead cultists that writhe and move like a hand inside of leathery puppet.  So after they kidnap our s damselindistress this is pulp of course.  If you want more modern sensibilities feel free! we get our shotguns and delve into the depths of this crazy priests church and find where theyve dug tunnels that connect into the old abandoned mine and that theyve dragged her off into some portal between worlds.And after we dive in to rescue her we unveil a dead city on an alien world.  We describe the alien skies and the strange angles of the buildings.  We let them come across more of these priests minions and we uncover some alien skeletons and alien murals that might explain to the heroes how to uncover it but the more lore they gain the more understanding they get of this place the more sanity points you take from them.  And at the heart of the city we find the massive pulsating flickering inhuman thing that killed the city.  That reaches for the girl.  That seeks to devour her to push itself inside her skin to push her as a final extrusion into our world because it has bored of playing with this one and a door opened to ours.  Its minions slay the priest It has no need of that frantic puppets meatsounds and frankly doesnt understand why it opened a door to its world but sure whatever.So you rescue the girl slay the minions get out and close the goddamn portal. Preferably with TNT.Game over.  Everyone survived.  You explored an amazing world.  You had a proper lovecraftian story.  But you never defeated the mythos. Its still out there. It still underpins reality bonus points if youve been sprinkling little references throughout the story as to these incursions either being relatively common in this area or the fact that theyre not really incursions just another way of looking at whats already there.  Its a dark truth that nobody wants to look at. But it didnt kill people unless they were stupid.Sure go on with your merry lives.  Have a white picket fence.  Marry the pretty hotel owner and continue to run the bedandbreakfast.  Lovecraft has loads of happy endings but theyre always tinged with this overhanging existential truth that none of it really matters.  Cthulhu is coming.  Its just a matter of time perhaps days perhaps aeons.  But you you dont matter.,rpg,cjkct01,3,t5_2qh2s
1628717,0,t3_2cwk0y,The tales of Lini the albino gnome druid and Lucky the winter wolf are legendary at my table. In Pathfinder a pale gnome is seen as a gnome who has given up on life an albino is a monstrosity. However she grew up in the Land of the Linnorm Kings and no proud human barbarian warrior is going to be afraid of a little gnome. Her animal companion was a winter wolf cub she rescued when its mother died in childbirth shamelessly stolen from Game of Thrones he was a cold subtype wolf until she can take the leadership feat to make him a cohort.When Lini at level  encounters the Big Bad an assimar blackguard she promises to drink mead from your skull! As a taunt. At level  she still keeps the skullmug.When a child breaks into their home Lucky the winter wolf is on watch. Not to big on the subtleties of humanoids he cant really tell a human child from a halfling adult in a quick glance. Freeze breath and a good bite later and the party wakes up to a scream and comes downstairs to find a very proud wolf sitting next to a dead kid missing a leg describing how he protected them from the intruder.Trying to capture assassins alive to question them Lucky rips the leg off one. Other party members accidentally kill the other. Lucky admonishes them for attacking vital areas while Lini staunches the bleeding.Lini buying the slowest sheep from a shepard. Why do you want the slowest one? Cue Lucky charging into the flock. Same party halfway through a dungeon crawl they find themselves on a beach outside the dungeon. Low on magic they decide to camp out here. Since they had just raided the wine cellar this camp quickly turns into impromptu beach party. Luckily the party keeps a stash of alchemists kindness hangover remedy.,rpg,cjkgqi3,2,t5_2qh2s

For example Equipment is where you find starting wealth per class listed right up front in the chapter.

Vast underground stretches of the city for those who cant stand the sun Vampires and the like. On vampires a proportional population of the living will need to be kept to keep them fed. Maybe some sort of blood bank where the small populous can exchange their blood in return for some small wealth. A register would be kept to keep people from over donating.

But its not really a typical adventurepath railroad more a setting that shifts over time with some relevant short adventures mostly optional. There should be plenty of space and time for the GM and player knights to get tangled up in their own local adventures and intrigues. Disclaimer I havent played it only skimmed through it lightly.Id say the Great Pendragon Campaign is more or less essential at least unless you want to adapt material from previous editions or improvise wildly because while the Pendragon main book is comprehensive in some ways it barely says anything about what comes after the starting King Uther period. And the timeline that advances through the different periods of and before Arthurs reign isnt just central to the setting but also to the game design the increasing power of the PCs as they score better horses and armour is balanced by the arms race as everyone else gets better gear on roughly the same accelerated timescale.,rpg,ck2yvdq,1,t5_2qh2s

I think that its the clash of opposite opinions albeit it needs some level of civility of course where people learn most. So lets roll!gt The Fate Core rulebook says over and over and over again that the game works best when players are looking to tell a great story not to win the game. ...Wait wait... Not to win doesnt mean prepare  dimensional anything stitch  an aspect et voila youre set to go right? It could be understood as  and thats how I see it  the story and fun are more important than hearing youve beaten the game congrats here are your  XPs.Plenty of games  any Cthulhuthemed KULT UA WoD  follow that logic. Some are even built upon that concept Paranoia!. Your PCs will probably die or go mad. But you can save them you can make it if youll be extra careful and intelligent. Still they and this include FC are not games where youre urged to prepare something that is just paper silhouette. Actually when you form some emotional connection between you and your PC is where true role playing starts.Typical merry murderhoboism IMHO no hard numbers stems from the fact that players both dont care about their characters and dont perceive them as alive d people. Its alright to do stupid things after all Ill simply prepare some replacement no big deal.gt  I actually think it does excel and very much so in exactly one aspect Tension. ...I agree. The tension is there and its very very strong especially when that damned Tower resembles Gigerian skeletal spine and you dont trust your fingers anymore. BUT! And think very carefully on this IS THAT ROLE PLAYING? Its not trollish question  I simply perceive Dread as part tabletop and part well board game ?. The latter aspect is once again IMHO what delivers the fun part. Thought experiment pick some role playing game. It doesnt have to be especially good. Just average is ok. Add the mechanics from some board or card game one that relies on tension. Presto the game is immediately far better more unique more interesting while at its core its still the same game.Thats why I dont perceive Dread as very good RPG  strip the Jenga of it replace it with some other mechanics and I guarantee you that itll lost the majority of its appeal. On the other hand pick Lovecraftian Mythos.

1795739,0,t1_ck5f7v7,Well looking at it from a design perspective this concept of Smell Evil is trading a roleplayingbased hindrance for a mechanicsbased advantage.Advantages  Smell Evil is unidirectional detection spells are usually a cone A free actionpermanent effect the at will ability still requires an action mostly ignores the usual detection spell duration it takes  rounds to get specific information with Detect Evil detects evil alignment sic Know Alignment as well as Evil descriptor reducesremoves the class penalty for evil acts this is more an impression from the following write up in the original postDisadvantage Character driven towards evil acts Character driven towards insanityAnd that doesnt address the major limitation for Paladins they are given particular attention by the force that grants them their abilitieswith several guidelines on how and when those abilities should be removed. As Smell Evil detrimentally affects this paladin they should actually lose their statuswhich in turn removes Smell Evil negating the issue.In a game like FATE though the writeup of the ability becomes its definition and it applies both as an advantage and disadvantage. The slow spiral to insanity? Thats the GM compelling your character and giving out Fate points for you to use later. The smelling is you discovering aspects on other characters which you can then tag for a bonus later.However I think that a lot of the mechanical balance issues to the ability can be addressed by tying it more to skill use... something like thisgtSense Evil  SuA paladin with Sense Evil loses the Detect Evil special ability. Instead they gain a circumstance bonus to Spot and Survival tracking checks for the purpose of determining if there is Evil in the vicinity. The bonus is equal to the strength of the Aura Power Faint  Moderate  Strong  Overwhelming  determined by the guidelines for the Detect Evil spell and can cause a stunned effect when the sense of Evil is overpowering. The amount of time spent to determine the direction and location of the source is at minimum equal to the duration for the Detect Evil spell  rounds and can be longer depending on environmental factors. The paladin may know shortly upon entering a room that Evil is present but would have to spend time to determine exactly where.  The player picks a sense that is linked to the ability with possible further limitations due to the sense used such as air movement for the sense of smell distance for touch etc. The character then gains a cue that is specific for that sense a particular color or symbol for sight a buzz for hearing etc that indicates Evil.  The sensory cue is distinctive and cannot be mistaken for another but it can be masked or overpowered by other factors.  Undetectable Alignment prevents the sensory cue as does the barrier of a Protection from EvilGood or Magic Circle.  The bonus might need some fiddling but I started at a negative to help balance the always on aspect of the ability. Some other options could be to use the paladins charisma bonus either replacing the aura power or enhancing it adding a new sense every  levels and changing it from a circumstance to moral or divine bonus. Could also add Sense Motive as a skill that this effect. Or even using sickened instead of stunned. Requiring an active skill roll and an action for round  strength results is a possible limitation. Another thought is to require a loss of a sensesuch as for paladins for a blind god.Detecting evil alignment is a huge advantage for the ability Id add something else to that as well... perhaps alignment could only be detected if the roll is  over the target number or a natural ... or conversely a roll of  could be a false positive as the paladin senses an evil that has nothing to do with the current circumstances.What ever you decide on I think that defining the mechanics of the ability it becomes much more comfortable for other playersas well as giving a stronger base for the RP aspects. Part of the curse of a rulesheavy system like DnD defining something with rules just makes it more comfortable.Im all for unusual paladins by the way. I played a halfling dexbased paladin for a campaign. She was balls of unconventional fun until she sacrificed herself to a black pudding to save the rest of the party. ,rpg,ck5i2rz,2,t5_2qh2s

1854877,0,t3_2fssnb,It sounds to me like you had a GM that is either Fresh to Fate or is a Rules Nazi to the extreme. Heres how I would have handled some of what youve posted. Some of it has been mentioned by others.Your character is still your character. No matter what I may want to happen or think would happen happens until we agree that it would happen whether you have fate tokens or not. You get to bargain and make a case for variations of the aspect being invoked or compelled. Also in general compels shouldnt be used to FORCE characters to do something. I can suggest you do something because of an aspect and you get the fate token for that but forcing you to do something seems to me heavy handed. You also have the right to concede conflict in any manner you wish and gain complete Narrative control of your character.Frozen solid by magic most likely isnt a good aspect its an obstacle if put on a PC or otherwise active character. It is however if youre in a frozen garden of winter and there are statues made from living beings as those Statues would have that Aspect.Regarding Shadowy once the aspect has been discovered it is available for one free tag from anyone. Meaning that upon entering the building and finding that it is indeed shadowy your spec ops guy would be able to get a free tag so long as anyone else in your group doesnt Tag it. I also wouldnt have an NPC tag it beforehand because thats just bad form. Rather I would make another hidden aspect called something like Knows the shadows and give it to the NPC so that it can be compelled.Being actively immolated as an aspect would be complicated but I would use it as a compel to cause that affected character to immediately Stop Drop and Roll to put out the flames. They would get a fate point and also have to tick off a stress box or take a consequence.Also the DFRPG is older than the current FATE and theyve done a lot of work to simplify it and make it easier to understand.

A little territorial dispute like wolves sometimes have will end with an entire forest burned to the ground by breath weapons and any standing structure in the vicinity leveled by at least about  thousand tons of dragon flesh smashing into it. Ive always played Dragons as omnivorous since the majority of their metabolism goes into their breath weapon anyway so when they show up over the next couple of centuries or so the entire local ecosystem has been devastated because in order to fuel a body the size of a mountain you need a lot of calories. Basically even when their intentions are good their presence will almost certainly cause problems for anyone else living in the area. It allows you to have the good dragons as well as the evil ones while still allowing people to have the oh shit reaction whenever one shows up it can fuel a lot of future conflicts with lots of moral grey areas our tribe is only nomadic because if dragons show up in our area we have to leave or starve dragons destroyed my ancestral home because they destroy everything you could even tie their immense destructiveness with some sort of apocalyptic prophecy.

Bards dont appeal to most people because they shrug them aside  they are not brilliant by default they are brilliant through what they express and how they do what they do. It makes playing them a challenge.Ive since changed my mind  Kingkiller is a perfectly acceptable recommended series for the PHB. I still think itd be very lengthy and not vary much from what one expects from DnD as my little caveat. For a DMG recommendation I still consider the series poorly suited as I think that the execution cant be mimicked without railroading and it isnt the concepts alone that make Kingkiller strong.Still glad to have cleared that up!

If thats the goal for your character I can already see some trouble brewing within him. Im not really a Pathfinder player but I would already say that true goodness does not go with your gods value of vengeance. Far from it honestly. Forgiveness is good vengeance is petty. If given the opportunity to slay the demons that killed your characters mother would you? Well theyre demons so thats probably a bad example. What if your assassin was hired to kill a good person but it was because that person was carrying a disease that could infect and kill thousands? Your personal moral code might be that no one should die. But if youre looking at the situation with amoral good in mind then that person needs to die. The needs of the many etc. How would your character react in that situation? How would letting the assassin kill that person affect you personally and your relationship with your god?I think you have a lot more room for nuance and development than you think. In a lot of modern fiction people tend to write angels as being dicks. But its not that theyre dicks theyre just looking at the larger picture.

Things like its virtues what it considers sinful its rituals etc.To give an example of a paladin Ive played He was a paladin of Ilmater a Forgotten Realms god of pain suffering martyrdom endurance perseverance and so on. He wasnt too concerned with strongarm justice more with helping those who were suffering and teaching them perseverance. In particular I had my paladin be of a sect that greatly emphasised the whole pain and suffering thing believing that their rituals involving the infliction of pain and injury upon themselves eased the suffering of others the idea being that their god channels the pain away from the sufferer and into the willing devotee. Due in part to almost constantly being in pain he was decidedly reserved even to the point of shy only speaking when it was important. Oh and he was a HalfOrc he viewed the racism and bigotry aimed at him as a test of his patience and spiritual endurance. ,rpg,cl1nbk4,2,t5_2qh2s

Murderhoboism is discouraged because wounds will fuck you up for months. Also the whole steel mechanic is great you create for example a princess or a scribe now you are faced with an assassin or bad guy. What would you do in most other games? I know the answer but that would be dangerous in BW.      You first have to make a steelcheck if you got the balls to really attack that guy. Or if you just cant commit to stab him.   If you want to recreate stuff like Lord of the Rings Malazan and all that stuff BW is perfect.     The system is really elegant the whole difficulty is front loaded so after you make the first cliff everything will make click and you understand it.

2097154,0,t3_2ivwjf,From my experience campaign writing in CoC is very different than in DnD.  In DnD you expect characters to live if the players know what they are doing.  In CoC the players could be playing well and still their characters will die.  What is typically important in a CoC game is the ongoing conflict against the unseen terrors.  So its good to write episodic adventures and for your campaign not to rely necessarily on the characters remaining constant but the themes and the information acquired.Let the players know what is important in a CoC campaign.  Information and artifacts are important as they will outlive characters and be useful in the ongoing fight against the cosmic horrors. Let these elements pass from character group to character group as old characters fade away due to death injury or insanity and the torch is passed to the new investigators.  It was a bit jarring to my players when we played some CoC coming from DnD but once they were used to that style of gameplay it was awesome.  They would heroically sacrifice themselves to make sure the Journal which had passed through three prior investigator groups over the span of a decade in game survived.,rpg,cl6e7xc,2,t5_2qh2s

There are these other guys there as well. Usually I would also give all the players a free contact that I would choose. The streetdoc or the fixer usually that they happen to share. In Nomine Satanis This is the totally inappropriate teammates that you will have for this mission. Now go and succeed or the divineinfernal wrath will be on you.Fantasy settings may require a bit more work but being part of the same travelling party in a dangerous region is a good start. Try to think about it during the character creation. Eh! You two could be married what do you think? or What do you think of being the squireapprentice of this guy?  which can happen for instance if someone takes a multiclass approach vs a specialist. I remember a thiefwizard being the apprentice of the wizard it was a nice dynamics going there.  Dont push it on the players but my experience is that they usually enjoy being able to bitch about each other from the start. Now what I love doing more and more is to give each character a little secret and to make it so that their secret would complement each other but also make them in a bit of a competition. For instance one has the map to a treasure he wants to loot for profit but another one knows how to decipher the map and also knows that this is not a treasure but rather an heirloom of her lost line only of traditional value. A third one needs to take this treasure for his guildmaster has an artifact that works as a compass but has no clue where it is or what it is.

You may screw up and get kicked out possibly have a dead character and lose it all.The thing that I had to really learn to understand was the hexadecimal system.  I had no idea what BC meant.  It had to take a while for me to understand what numbers the letters represented.  It made for a more technical game overall but it was fine because the game itself can get VERY technical if desired.  It however is NOT required as the game can stay light and friendly.When we decided to purchase our first ship designing on a freighter then getting a base template and transferring it onto grid paper was a lot of fun.  We all enjoyed getting to voice our opinions on what we wanted to add on the ship.

I mean it would be embarrassing to vouch for old flake DM and then  months later he flakes AGAIN.So it turned out great!  For  months.  And then you guessed it he began missing games.  Like a lot maybe half.  We all finally realized what his problem was he treated games like affairs  hot and passionate for the honeymoon period and then he was off oogling some other games and lusting to play them instead.  Ohhh dice pools!  Or Ohh th edition!  Or Ohhh classless systems!So I emailed the group  I was indeed embarrassed that I vouched and he was flaking  and asked him to commit.  He was furious that I did that as a group message and began swearing and telling me I was an asshole and a betrayer and no friend of his and how he fucking hated our shitty group anyway.I wasnt the DM at the time but the DM kicked him out super fast.I guess all of this is to say that sometimes people have to stop playing because of serious issues.  And sometimes theyre just douchebags.  I wish you all the best in navigating that issue.,rpg,clbhvs0,5,t5_2qh2s

2158463,0,t1_cle6ckd,It depends. With most Spells that cause fire they cause either d or d per caster level which means its often scaled up to be good for the CR of the encounter the caster is probably dealing with. More mundane fire can be less useful though as the GM id be willing to make exceptions even if the rules dont say  for example even if it doesnt damage them more zombies may well be afraid of a flaming torch the fighter is brandishing. And even then theres a big difference between the damage from pushing someone into a campfire or the heat of a burning building. If your players are having difficulty thinking outside the box id say encourage them to do so more. Sometimes this can be done with just hinting and sometimes you can inspire them by having an NPC friendly or otherwise do oddball stuff like this that they can emulate.One other approach I like to use is the token system. The party start a session with a set number of tokens and can earn more through roleplaying. They can then spend these tokens to make cool stuff happen anything the GM has made plausible or hasnt described. For example in the past ive seen tokens spent on everything from making sure an inn has a hanging sign outside that the ranger can shoot the chains off of to drop on an enemy to a Bard just happening to have a flute handy on him for an impromptu performance at a feast to even making the Halfling mayor of a town be secretly having an affair with his Orc bodyguard. This lets the party get away with a load of stuff that isnt in the rules create scenarios that help their aims or roleplay and also encourages roleplaying in the first place!,rpg,cle6us1,0,t5_2qh2s

In a game like Exalted then the character generally is off training or working on an ongoing project and I will often allow the player to make some rolls the next time the show up if its something that requires a certain number of successes.The most common hands down is to just retcon whats happening so that the person who is missing never came along and who ever is there who wasnt last time has their character there instead. in a recent runequest game this was actually easy and made sense as they had a camp nearby and often went back for supplies and hence to swap out characters.

If he doesnt get in position in time then Lyle has no idea where his team are and cannot be sure that he is giving the window at the right time.

2322690,0,t1_clyrzos,Our group fell into this rut a bit basically to the point where I realized that most of our individual successes and failures werent going to impact later events.And its not that our GM was in any way bad its just it became apparent we were mostly there to help him flush out the filler for a story he had in his mind. That in particular was only sometimes bad when it came to looking for new and unique equipment or developing our own characters.Wed always fall into the Third Option trope where Option  was fairly standard or simply just what you were looking for    Option  had some special characteristics but also some sort of drawback    Option  was in some way unique or potentially plot relevantBecause of the third option syndrome in several games I was able to prepare contingencies that completely derailed the pace of the story in one case we were starting with legacy versions of our characters to prepare ourselves for their future reincarnation where the main story would take place one third option choice I made could have prevented us all from dying in the first place. There was a session not long after that I couldnt make so I sent a go for it Ill catch up next week! message to him to find out the next week basically everyone used my character as a meatshield and trapmonkey at the GMs recommendation so that my character would be both incapacitated and mentally handicapped and unable to make the kind of choices I had previously that would have saved all of our lives.,rpg,clysqwf,5,t5_2qh2s

2381729,0,t3_2mljy7,Im a big fan of devils though I am mostly familiar with devils in the DampD setting.  I am just recently reading pathfinder and I know it can be similar and not too difficult to borrow things over.  So here are some things about devils and pacts as it works in DampD rd ed.If by The Devil the PC is interest in contacting Asmodeus the Lord of Hell thats just not going to happen.  The mightiest devil of all isnt going to concern himself with a PC unless you are playing an Epic level campaign and the PC has done some epic stuff that makes his soul incredibly valuable.And thats an important thing to note.  Different souls have different value.  If you play using alignments a Lawful Good soul is more valuable than say a Neutral Evil one.  Or think of it as a cleric who has saved orphans and gone hungry to feed others is more valuable to a devil than a thief who killed a family of five just for some gambling money.  This is because of the difficulty in obtaining a soul.That isnt to say these lesser souls have no value to devils.  They do!  One of the ways devils gain power in hell is by harvesting souls and there are plenty of weaklower level devils who are eager to move up in the ranks.  It is more than likely your PC will attract the attention of a weaker devil.  And there are rules you can use as a guideline to having a devil NPC form a contract what is called a Faustian Pact with the PC.One type of contract is a Pact Certain.  The PC declares allegiance to the Lord of Hell becomes lawful evil and must always act in accordance to lawful evil.  The other type of contract is a Pact Insidious which is usually used for those who are less likely to just out right serve the Lord of Hell.  Usually it has an outline of corrupt acts the person must perform before he receives all of the rewards.  Hidden provisions in the contract revoke the previous benefits if the person stops performing the specific acts.  Strict prohibitions forbid the person from disclosing the contents of the agreement to any third party.  The devil doesnt want any meddling priest to catch wind and offer to perform an atonement spell for example.Rewards can be anything like extra XP additional feats additional spell slot ability increase bonus on a skill or just gold.  If you want the reward or benefit to be tailored specifically to what the player is hoping to get...I think it will be best to have a chat with them.  I know it kind of ruins the surprise and lets him know that you are at least thinking about it.  You can just explain that you need a little more information to see if it is fitting for the campaign and that it may or may not happen.  Corrupt acts can be desecrating a good church murder inflicting torture which you can just handwave or even betraying a friend.  You can be creative here and decide how evil act is and the value behind that act.So with all that said one fun part about signing a pact with a devil is that the devil wants your soul sooner rather than later.  The devil cant outright kill you as it would nullify the contract and not exactly be lawful but that doesnt mean the devil cant have a little influence and make the players life a living hell in hopes that the player wont make it out alive.,rpg,cm638rn,1,t5_2qh2s

Be clear that their alignment will shift if they keep acting evilchaotic. Maybe theyre OK with that or maybe thats enough. This is the verbal warning of RPGsB. Have them denied entry to the city they want to go in they are now known. If this isnt enough to scare them...C. Have law enforcementless paladin ordersBounty Hunters find them while theyre doing other things and try to killcapture them. Feel free to make it a very difficult fight a few levels above theirs. Ideally theyll have to flee We all know no PCs ever flee though and try to have the good guys capture them alive. Then have a trial and possibly jailexecution. If the group never wants to RP the trial will be a great punishment and maybe theyll just want to quit and start a new game but this time realize their actions have repercussions.D. If they escapekill the first guys keep on them. Have people ambush them in the middle of another fight since they were being tracking Give them the rolls to spot that theyre being followed if anyone gets suspicious though and make the do gooders stronger and stronger as their infamy rises. Emphasis capturing them to try to salvage the game but feel free to kill them if theyre resisting. Either theyll get the idea that they should repent or murderhobo their way to a total party wipe eventually. They should have trouble spending any gold they find if theyre deniedwanted in any city except maybe the shadiest of the shady places... and those tend to be dangerous on their own. Finally just dont make people magically know theyre evil. Put up wanted posters if people saw their crime. Have witnesses pop up in trials Goblins that escaped and saw them kill the rival party and fled while they were busy.  and make sure their crimes are only unpunished if there is no evidence or way for others to find out.,rpg,cm868y6,2,t5_2qh2s

The GM can change the narrative to give the player a threat that they have to deal with while at the same time giving the player something back that they can use to deal with the threat or in fact something that the player can use further down the line if they can manage to deal with the threat without having to use the Fate point they just received.,rpg,cma2qcn,1,t5_2qh2s

I broke it down to  AttributesLife  Amount of Physical Damage a character can takeAmount of Physical Output a Character can giveSanity  Amount of Mental Damage a character can takeAmount of Metal Output a Character can givePower  Amount of Defense you can put AGAINST LifeSanity attacksSo basically if you character gets hurt their life goes down and their attack or overall physical activity goes down. Power comes in as a defense to protect from external forces. So if YogSothoth attacks you for  and you power is  you can negate it all. But there are power points to spend so it can always be changing. Im still tweaking things with the cards but so far it makes sense. Its a fast fun game. As for games using it  I actually like it better. It makes one be more cautious of delving into territory such a fighting or physical hindering actions. I think it would be less numbersy as well.

2510048,0,t3_2objwe,It is a very good thing that your murder hobo to be is playing a magus.  Playing a magus can be challenging.  As a GM make sure you fully understand the magus rules and make him really work at getting to know how to play his character.  The magus can be pretty squishy and doesnt have a lot of depth so use that to your advantage when he tries killing things that he shouldnt.  Beyond  fights a day hes not going to have a lot of oomph at lower levels so use those times to bring those dontkillme npcs in and what happens happens.  As always realistic consequences will work to your advantage.  Id recommend you use these consequences to make the game more interesting as opposed to just smacking his player around as punishment.For example have him taken prisoner for one of his incidents.  The party may need to help get him out perhaps even doing favors for various parties.  Meanwhile the magus may have to deal with physical labor other prisoners and may even have an interesting adventure while performing his community service.  In the end the player should learn his lesson.  Make sure that there is a serious price like losing money equipment or even being marked as an offender.  Face tattoos make a good impression that everyone will see and can be used to mark him appropriately.  In the future you can use this markings to allow NPCs simply to refuse meeting with him where they could be in danger.,rpg,cmm79lx,1,t5_2qh2s

Also theres this thing called the psychic maelstrom which gives people psychic powers. Most of this lore is very much left to the imagination and I imagine it wouldnt be hard to treat it as a more medieval fantasy type deal if you dont want guns. Just reskin any close range guns as melee weapons and treat any far guns as bows crossbows or thrown weapons of any kind.Mechanically it uses d and a score of  or less is a fail  is a partial success or at some cost and a score of  is a complete success. Usually a partial success involves the player making a tough choice. I do like that by using two dice for every roll the results fall into a bell curve rolls in the middle ranges are more common than very high or very low rolls the one thing I dont like is the lack of initiative. Any player can take any action at any time. so either the players have to make an effort not to hog spotlight or the DM has to take control. Also NPCs dont take actions bad things happen to the players when they fuck up.

Meanwhile the fighter only gets better at hitting things in the same way with the same weapon.

Society develops in response to its environs and I imagine a storm that blows through once a month and turns everything to chaos would strongly dissuade any large stable CityStates from cropping up.  Maybe have a faction of storm wizards that train to counteract the effects of these storms and protect society. Or limit what effects they can have to a predictable . So even though people can expect what will happen they can never be entirely sure. I would suggest you look into high storms from Brandon Sandersons The Stormlight Archives. Its a world that already has magical storms so you can borrow from that setting if you want. Other than what you can get from that here are some that come to mind.. Reverse rain that sucks an area dry of its water leaving it barren.. Winds that only effect certain types of materials. Lightning that turns whatever it strikes to stone or water.. A fog that carries the voices and cries of the deceased through town. . A light rain that causes certain people to have shared dreams or visions. Possibly leaving them connected or with each others memories.. A powerful storm that seemingly has no effect on anything just a huge illusion except for one person per settlement who takes the brunt of the storm. Usually killing them..

And you did NOT need maps to play .. Two of the four groups Ive played in did not use maps. I used minis  maps because i like it but Ive run combat without them. And Ive seen freeform minis in ADampD games many many times. If th had had something to really draw in already existing players Id play it. But honestly Id take Castles and Crusades or some other lite d reboot over it. Theres no skill system in Next which in my opinion sucks. They had a real opportunity to revive skill points.Have the basic way pick some skills get  on them and then the advanced way where you can spend skill points. if they cleaned up the . skill system to better support multiclassing and make crossclass less confusing theyd have real potential.As it stands the skills in Next are mildly okay. people say well its no differnece because everyone maxed out their skills anyway but that is so very not true. I usually saved  or  points to put into trainedonly skills so Id at least have a chance or be able to aid another with them. Also Id sometimes split up and go half into two skills rather than max out one if it was something that didnt require cuttingedge bonuses like profession cooking or something. So I think they missed out there as well.Yeah I know Next is trying to be lite and all that just saying that it COULD have been while still including stuff I liked.

If you are resolving tasks instead of situations in any AWE game you are making a mistake.Jumping in here with a relevant quoteElide the action sometimes and zoom in on its details othertimes. Play out a battle in precise and exacting detail but in themiddle of it say so they keep you both pinned down there untilnightfall.  Apocalypse World p. It seems to me to be the authors intention that you use the Moves in whatever scale seems appropriate and since Dungeon World uses the same resolution system with only a few changes I have to imagine DW works the same way. This is probably why many Moves have such vague triggerphrases. You can do something under fire when this jackass across the field lets it rip with a machinegun but you can also do something under fire when you work on your Holding during the dry season when theres an awful lot of fire on account of all the dry brush around if you want to be literal or because youre really goddamn thirsty if you dont.And if you look at it your own explanation actually contains the answer I thinkgt Every single dice roll should answer a question that propels the action forward.How about will Carrick kill or even wound or even hit this Orc with his bow? Thats certainly a question that needs answering to propel the action forward but its also definitely a single task what results from Carrick loosing at an Orc? You could substitute will Carrick kill etc. all of these Orcs? but Id say its probably not a mistake not to especially since many intext examples especially of combat read a lot more like theyre resolving taskrelated minutiae than resolving entire situations.Or have I misunderstood?,rpg,cn7yn6j,6,t5_2qh2s

Especially with the old Deadlands system using magic is RISKY and he got tired of bad stuff happening to him when he was trying to play like a DampD combat mage. I warned him about this ahead of time but he didnt really listen. I offered to have him write up a new PC but he chose to just step out of the game until the Deadlands campaign was done.Ive refused to play in games with systems I dont like. I had a friend run a very mathheavy Mass Effect GURPS game with all the minutia from GURPS Space and stuff in place. I dont like that much detail in my games. It also started with us getting transported out of the setting which I was interested in to an unknown area of space he expected us to explore which had none of the stuff I liked about Mass Effect in it.

2729802,0,t3_2rbgp6,In general I tend to use handouts or anagrams that are included in written synopses or Rogues Gallery style compilationsI once made an NPCs name an anagram of the name of the nemesis of one of the PCs. It was in fact the nemesis but magically disguised. He even taught a cursed version of Magic Missile to the PC which automatically targeted the PC no matter who cast it. It was hilarious for me when the PC tried to cast the spell in the final battle with the nemesis and the magical missiles targeted himself.Ive also slightly altered an image of one of the big bads and included him as a shop keeper in the city in which the PCs were based complete with name and everything. If I recall correctly it was a matter of putting a beard on the guy and glasses  it was a Clark Kentstyle disguise.I have always wanted to do a rhyming clue  but bad rhyming like the daemon Etrigan  or do something in the form of a prophecy like From the depths the artifice bat hides gnosis in its wings where the actual clue is in the spoiler one guys Lamborghini Murcielago sunk in the harbor. Murcielago means obviously bat and gnosis means hidden knowledge.Basically I think its fair to include clues for the players that obsess over such things but you should never bank on the players noticing that one clue because some players are so clueless that they wont get a clue if they undressed smeared themselves with clue musk and danced the sacred clue mating dance during clue mating season in a field full of horny clues.,rpg,cned7wb,4,t5_2qh2s

2783782,0,t3_2rymxb,I wrote this on rrpgdesign but Im just gonna post it hereAre you afraid of Orcs? Are you afraid of Goblins? Youre not? Okay maybe they can be threatening not they certainly arent horror. They are enemies you know stereotypes you are familiar with as a player and consumer of fantasy tropes in media. You know full well that you can kill one and what it can do.Likewise when you come up against a Medusa you know it has a stone gaze. When Bob gets petrified beside you you dont feel a thing because its expected.Which brings me to my rant too many times in an RPG Ive seen horror done wrong. There are so many lovecraftian RPGs out there and most of them play on the same thing you see one you go insane. That honestly is a little underwhelming.Having your characters go insane from a die roll is not nice but it certainly isnt terrifying either. In many games Ive seen and read about it feels... cold and mechanical. The roleplaying itself seemed forced.Here I propose a different way of tackling horror.Describe dont nameGiving your monster a name tells your players that people already knows something about it taking away the unknown factor. Describe  it as it is and let your players give it a name. Better yet show a picture of the monster to one of the players and get him or her to describe it to the other players... in character.Nonobvious anatomyIf it looks humanoid and I dont know how to kill it guess what Im going to do? Im going to cut off its head. Decapitation works most of the time and when it doesnt at least it cant bite me.Giving your monsters a familiar shape takes away some of the horror of it. If I see a bunch of tentacles with odd blobs and sacs I wont know how to deal with it. Burn it with fire? Yeah likely. But that also means Im going for maximum collateral damage as a default mean to deal with the creature. Which is what you as a GM want carnage and overreaction.Foreshadow foreshadow foreshadowNothing is more scary than hearing signs of a creature knowing it is here stalking you somehow but never knowing when it will strike. Use this to your advantage as a GM. Foreshadow its presence by sight sound touch heat or the random scream of an NPC in a far away room. Build the tension before you unleash the beast.Threat projectionWhen a monster strikes it should have impact. A random NPC guard in full plate gets impaled by its horns like the armour is made of paper. A powerful NPC tagging along with the party who have time and again proved him or herself in the field of battle gets squashed in one round.When somebody who you know is better than you gets crushed like a fly you are going to lose heart no matter how courageous you are. Use this psychological trick as a method to show how strong and powerful this creature is.Dont stat your monsterI generally dont like statheavy RPGs but if you can try not to stat your monster. If you give it numbers your players will find a way to kill it. The best monsters I have are those that you cannot directly confront. Those that you cannot kill only hinder seal or run away from. These have no stats. Players will have to figure out a way to stop it that doesnt involve poking it full of holes.ConclusionHope this helps. I have tons of ideas on how to make monsters truly horrifying but little time to write them all down. Let me know if you have other techniques!,rpg,cnki8el,9,t5_2qh2s

2809580,0,t3_2s8hkr,It definitely helps if you the player knows exactly what is being hidden. A dark mysterious or horrendous past can manifest itself in plenty of different ways. One of my favorite mysterious character types is the crazy wizardsorcererbarbarianwhatever. Not party crazy or doritos tacos crazy but actually rewired. The oddness manifests itself in strange ways. You dont have to shove it in their faces by having conversations with voices they cant hear although for the right character that totally works and is believable. You can play it out in subtle ways like not understanding jokes or references that anyone should get or by doing things slightly different than others. Eccentricity. Think Luna Lovegood.One of my most mysterious characters was an eccentric diviner. The basic story was that shed been raised a wizarding nation and was something of a divination prodigy. She was an excellent student always with her nose in a book or scrying implement. Then between one day and the next she had a total change in personality. She stopped working as hard and started spending a lot more time in town in taverns and brothels. She became something of an experienceseeker and hedonist going so far as to create a ring that let her change sex at will to experience life on the other side. By the time her colleagues pressed her into working with the party to stop some worldthreatening evil partly because she was still the greatest diviner of the age and partly because she was creeping them out no one knew if she was a she or a he or somewhere in between and anyone meeting him or her would never suspect how shed spent the majority of her life. Aside from the occassional Is that a nymph over there? Ill be right back... moments she displayed her oddness by laughing at things that werent funny and not laughing at things that were. She would sometimes respond to question with sentences that made no sense in context. Not gibberish just a seemingly sudden change is subject or a reference to something just a bit off quote The sky is looking rather greener than usual today.. She was sometimes fatalistic and on rare occassion morose and was known to withhold information if no one asked or even knowingly throw herself into danger with a laugh.The key here was that I was able to pick and choose what was funny to her. It wasnt random. Her answers were never random. She wasnt just some strange eccentric she was a person whose mind had been broken in a very specific way by seeing something no one should ever see and everything she did made perfect sense if you knew her secret. But nobody knew her secret. Even out of character it was just me and the GM and the rest of the party didnt even know what gender she really was she wasnt really either by that point let alone how shed broken her mind one one night looking into the vast mysteries of the universe and seeing that all she knew and could ever know was simply the fantasy of some unknowable nerd. The knowledge that she wasnt real that none of it was real that her entire being was a just a game drove her insane and made her give up on much that she had once thought to be important. Nothing was important anymore.Sorry. I seem to have drifted off topic there for a while. Where was I? If you dont understand why your character acts the way they do you just come off as random and people dont care enough to find out. There must be a method to the madness or there is no mystery.,rpg,cnnfves,17,t5_2qh2s
2812476,0,t3_2saew8,Fate accelerated isnt very crunchy so inventory management will have to be off the cuff but the skills will be spot on. you can do shooting foraging medicine and perhaps even non shooting methods of hunting for meat crafting snares or other simple traps. I recommend figuring out your animals maximum drag capacity weight of carts and weight of equipment for inventory management. This prevents them from taking too much stuff at the beginning and if their animal dies how much stuff they have to leave behind. Bullets of course should be tracked especially in any game in which survival and zombies are included.For complications or benefits on the road I recommend a good old fashioned random table beforehand with your GM judgement allowing you to skew things in favor of your players dice fall as they may would be more accurate to Oregon trail but the game was designed quite harshly and you are looking for a good story. If you want to build tension towards the zombie thing have them find a leftover cart earlier on with all the inhabitants gone as though they set up camp and just walked off into the horizon. this will give them extra supplies but not more they can carry and create an eerie vibe if you do it right.broad stroke suggestion?

We convinced it that we were the people who were supposed to meet it and that we would return soon to fulfill its food and transport needs. I called back to the Order of Hermes and asked them to borrow a weapon to help fight it. The operator left for a few minutes then came back with a wooden sword gave me its name and instructions on its use.Our Estatic began a ritual to speed us up so we could have a chance against the vampires Celerity but botched badly and the paradox effect made all of us exist backward in time for about  hours. After it wore off we managed to see ourselves leaving the first meeting held off for a bit then told it that we were ready. Once we got it in our vehicle our Akashic Brother used the wooden sword to stake it through the car seat. I called the Order again and they brought us all to Cordoba with Masters ready to take the vampire into possession. While we were telling who it was and what happened the operator came to me to let me know that I was calling in looking for a weapon. I told them that they gave me the wooden sword but none of the Masters had ever even heard of such a weapon.

If DampD hadnt been there to become the source of every dispute it wouldve been something else.The experiences he relates are mostly negative thats true but I dont think he ever blames it on DampD. His experience with DampD was a negative one but its mostly because he associates it with a pretty negative phase of his life. At least thats how I saw it.

2910410,0,t1_cny9kfk,Ok so you have basically gone to D and added magic portals. That is pretty complicated but dont panic. I have  reasons. What Im describing is a Euclidean shape.  You have a bunch of magic doors that go to nonadjacent rooms so your shape is not Euclidean and is not contained to what I described. . Ignoring the portals I can actually see how it makes sense.  Consider this analogy that is in only  dimensions. Imagine a giant cube large enough so the faces are rooms. It has  faces. On each face we will clunk on  rooms. We will place a room on top of each face and underneath each face. Therefore either the ceiling or the floor is bolted down to a face of the cube. This is basically one of your cubes.To move to D we can get  of these cubes and stack them together. Since we have an additional dimension we actually have room to combine them such that each room has its ceiling being a face one one cube and its floor being a face on another cube!Here is an example of one roomThe ceiling is attached to the Strange cube. ||The floor is attached to the Charm cube.If we now add in your magic doors that teleport to nonadjacent rooms then we get your shape. You said you didnt add in pathways for the reflected sides. That equates to not putting doors in the floorsceilings.This is sorta hard to explain without diagrams but hopefully this makes sense.

2930238,0,t1_co146ky,Lock picking almost always can be described as using tools to emulate the actual key to the lock. So in general you can do anything to the lock that an actual key could do and probably more.Figuring out the correct direction to turn the lock is actually a pretty big deal. Someone who knows what they are doing can generally figure it out when initially surveying a lock but its definitely something you can screw up. I can quote the exact passage from a lock picking book by Eddie the Wire if you want.Id actually agree with OP that this is exactly the kind of mistake that would be made by an untrained person who just got incredibly lucky but Ive never played a d system. As people are pointing out it should probably have much more to do with the game mechanics than the specifics of lock picking.EDIT Come to think of it this should probably never happen in a game. If you pick a lock by turning it in the unlocking direction it will end up unlocked even if it started out unlocked the only difference is that your efforts were useless. If you pick a lock by turning it in the locking direction it will end up locked whether it started out locked or unlocked. In a game a success in opening a lock has to include potentially trying both directions if it didnt rolling a success on a locked door would occasionally result in the door staying locked.

As a character your goal is to stay out of hell as a demon youre trying to drag another character to hell.That said there is a lot in the book about building angel NPCs that are almost exactly as you describe driven by morality have wings special powers etc. I dont think the RPG intends it but you could probably build a campaign of angels instead of demons using the rules.,rpg,co87fgt,1,t5_2qh2s

3015122,0,t3_2unpkv,Hrm this comes from an improv background but Id argue that writing specifically is what you want to avoid. In improv writers are those performers who walk into a scene with an idea and they will force the scene to follow that idea. In my mind a writer is the sort of person who walks in with a clearly defined picture of This is what my character would do!A player is somebody who looks at the current situation and asks Whatd be the most fun thing that could happen right now? and Given what we know about my character how can I make that character do something fun?Its semantics right? The point is at the table everybody should be looking for a way to heighten the current situation. How can we make the stakes higher the events bigger and the experience more fun?This by the way is why Im not fond of combat in RPGs. Combat is very teleological it has a clear welldefined purpose. It has a clear end state in most cases and it progresses usually from high energy everybody at top form with resources to burn to low energy hit points depleted spells used etc..If I were designing an RPG combat system the longer the combat goes the more powerful and destructive the characters become.

3018812,0,t3_2uontw,Technoir It hits perfectly what Ive wanted for a while. Its very low prep for the GM and the story evolves as you go so its the same process of discovery for everyone. The system is very tight and has some nice features. You automatically succeed if youre not opposed by another character and your abilities are verbs that describe exactly what you do. Wushu Open The way its set up makes it ideally suited to online play. You can get through a scene much quicker in Wushu than you can with most other systems  it doesnt have a bunch of complex balancing mechanics on how you can spend your narrative control nor do you have to do a handshake to see if your action succeeded.Dragonlance th Age This is specifically because I started with ADampD e there are things about it I love and things about it I hate and DLA hits the things I love while avoiding the stuff I hate. As a bonus lots of people read Dragonlance novels so its an easier sell than some other systems.Anima Prime The simulation of Final Fantasy type games is pretty cool by itself but what I really like is how its been constructed to take into consideration the wide range of players. A lot of games are playtested with very enthusiastic gamers and have some rules elements that end up being exclusive to certain types of players that might just be there to spend time with friends. Anima Prime gives storytellers and method actors the freedom they want to play how they like without penalising anyone for having more dull descriptions for their actions. Its one of the few systems which would actually accommodate everyone in some of the larger groups Ive run.Dungeon World I used to be annoyed at how often I saw it recommended but I finally took a look at it and now I see why. So the biggest bonus here is its a popular highly recommended game that I actually like. Prince Valiant The Storytelling Game Took me ages to finally get my hands on it so admittedly Im a bit biased as I expected to like it but its really good. Its amazingly simple especially considering the time it was made in and is also very flexible. I never read the Prince Valiant comics but it would be absolutely perfect for a Hercules or Xena type game.JAGS Wonderland The JAGS system itself is pants but the setting is bloody phenomenal and actually works with a lot of systems so you dont need to use JAGS. It has one of the most interesting takes on magic Ive ever seen. Well worth the read even if you never get to play it.Transhuman Space Much like JAGS GURPS is pants but its a great setting book for the near future and has plenty of supplements to really flesh it out. One of the big problems with it is great now what?. Its just setting it doesnt tell you a thing about what to do with it. But thats really like the modern day. Is it investigative use THS with GUMSHOE perhaps is it action use Wushu perhaps want a more solid backdrop for Technoir? Perfect. Want to focus heavily on personal interaction  use A Dirty World.  Want to smash supernatural mystery together with hard sci fi? Use Unknown Armies.

3020655,0,t3_2urcij,As GMs we have all encountered the type of player that picks the same character over and over again. Admittedly when Im not the GM Im one of those players. DnD? Rogue or Ranger. Even in WoW Im a fucking hunter. Its the bows they give me a chubby. Vampire? Gangrel. Done. Star Wars? Jedi Knight dual wielding light sabers. Im generally boring in that aspect but its what I like to play. That all being said I dont have a very memorable character Ive played theyre basically all the same and blend together in my head. However just like we have all come across players like this we may have also encountered the player that makes a new unique character every time they create a new PC. For me this players characters are not only memorable but they often define the game. For Star Wars hes been a four armed alien doctor with little to no weapon skills but with an affinity for his races musical instrument. Combat was a true threat for this PC. But what he lacked in combat expertise he made up for with epic medical skills and knowledge as well as entertaining the group with his musical talents. For the next SW campaign I allowed this player to make up his own race. He chose to be a living plant the size of a large head of lettuce. He lacked a mouth as this race as determined by the player communicated by rubbing their leaves together. The PC was highly susceptible to damage as most plants are. But again what the plantman lacked in straight physical qualities he made up for with his ability to control the Force. Then there was the Vampire The Dark Ages game I ran. The player opted for a Lasombra taking a flaw giving him an ever present disease syphilis. He assigned  point to the resource background making this PC a rich landowning lord. His face permanently disfigured by syphilis was kept masked. Lord Borgia was a brutal ruler controlling those that farmed his land with fear and threats of disfigurement or death. Hes played strong Orc warriors that rush into combat heroically dying facing the final BBEG. Wise sagelike cybermonks that use skill and finesse to defeat their foes. A fallen Jedi turned gamblerdrunk seeking redemption as he faces temptation. A sewer dwelling Nosferatu Holmesian detective. The list goes on and on. He pulls inspiration from movies books games music had planned on playing a Henry Rollins like Brujha in a Vampire game that never was and his expansive knowledge of Renaissance era history.

3065573,0,t1_cofn7fw,I do always try to make sure Ive got some genericeasily adaptable ones ready to be dropped in to whatever is currently going on though when I create locations either in loose worldbuilding or a specific set piece it can also makes sense to have certain relevant puzzlestraps in that location so those ones are specifically tied to that place.I find puzzles significantly harder than traps since generally making it relevant to whats currently going on makes it a lot more fair to the party and a lot less immersion breaking which can be hard to do in improvisation.  Ill often try to tie them to certain things like Is it heavily magic based? Is it cruel and simple?

3066056,0,t3_2v9t1u,I just played a short  session adventure using the FFG edge of the empire rules. I generally liked it but it was way crunchier than I expected. I thought the threatadvantage mechanic was going to be fairly narrative and freeform but instead I found dozens of different ways to spend advantage and it all varied based on the skill being used. Are you throwing a grenade? Are you shooting a blaster? Are you fixing the engine?  All have different ways to spend advantage.  It really turned me off. Not only was it complex but sometimes you spend advantage to trigger something immediate and other times you spend it on something very meta like giving a boost die to someone taking a later action in the turn.Oh and dont even get me started on  minute combat rounds in which I can use my one maneuver to go prone or to move.  Seriously? In one minute of frenetic action I cant move and dive behind cover without straining myself by taking extra maneuvers?,rpg,cofskqo,1,t5_2qh2s
3067599,0,t3_2vaf25,Ill give you an example of a one shot I made recently. The players were evil in this game.I started with an idea evil group needs a prophecied chosen one kidnapped so they can raise the child for evil instead of good. Then I built that out. Where does the child live? I imagined a temple monks raising the child. That gives me whowhat the players could encounter to fight so I set up two encounters that they could run into. One was optional in case I needed it and one was not. I try to be VERY flexible when planning because players never do what you expect. From there I flesh out the surrounding area if needed. In this case that meant a rough map of the town around the temple some npcs in case they wanted to interact etc etc. I built out the chosen ones backstory because I decided the chosen one was a gold dragon and I needed an explanation for how a baby gold dragon was being raised by monks dedicated to Bahamut fyi. Also because I go over the top with backstory. Once I have all these pieces Goal Resistance whowhatwhenwhere etc Im set to go because as I said players always do the unexpected. It makes sense to me to just create the building blocks and then improvise as I go. I run very permissive games. As long as the thing the player wants to do makes sense within the game world I let them try. In this game that led to one of the players throwing the head monk over a cliffside balcony unexpectedly thereby making the final fight way easier on the players. Lastly Id suggest putting everything in a google doc. That lets me put links to the monsters stat blocks relevant rules we might need wiki pages for in depth info in case of a really good knowledge roll or request for more info in my doc instead of having to write them all out and be flipping through pages of stuff wondering where I wrote shit down.,rpg,cofybdv,3,t5_2qh2s

I never let the absurd or weird break me out of character.  You shouldnt be trying to make it happen or force it but often times if you just play naturally the best shenanigans often happen.

I dont like Pathfinder its just a preference thing. I find it sluggish like it wants me to play a certain way. To each their own.Honestly my favourite system is GURPS which is unpopular but infinitely modular and I have a lot of time on my hands to build worlds and confidence enough to disregard all the rules I dont care about and still keep the game running. I freelance as a GM and build custom games for people using whatever system. Ive had people ask me to build an Xmen game that they can play so I lay out the rules they need to know and build a few sample characters and a starter scenario to get them going. I did one for Firefly Harry Potter and a Western VampireHunter game.I run a game every week. I do a lot of oneoffs for mixed experience players and we use a very simple homebrew when we dont want to spend more than ten minutes on character creation.  stats  points each point spent is a  on a d. strength dexterity intelligence charisma and everyone gets  hit points. Now describe your character in three words and the three things they always carry.Ok Im putting  pts in dex and  pts in charisma. Im a runaway cultleaders daughter so Im wily good at lying to people and nervous about the cult following me. I carry a knife a watch and a water bottle. Can I have stolen ten million dollars from the cult before I left?You can have stolen as much as you want but the amount youve stolen will decide how hard theyre searching for you. Ten million dollars will mean theyve got teams looking for you in every major city and probably bribed a lot of police across the country. If you want less hunters steal less.

While its true that Anita has never blatently stated Games Cause Sexism in such a blunt fashion there is the last three min of Women as Background Decoration Part  where Anita makes the following claims.   The way video games portray women affects the way we look at all women Furthermore this perception is not limited only to sexualized women in whats called the Spill Over Effect these sexist attitudes carry over to perceptions of all women as a group regardless of their attire activities or professions    Playing sexist video games will causes people to be okay with rape. Researchers have also found that after longterm exposure to hypersexualized images people of all genders tend to be more tolerant of the sexual harassment of women and more readily accept rape myths including the belief that sexually assaulted women were asking for it deserved it or are the ones to blame for being victimized.  Or you know the part where she claims that MEDIA You were right she never said games specifically cause it just that games are the worst offender for being so interactive causes sexism. In other words viewing media that frames women as objects or sexual playthings profoundly impacts how real life women are perceived and treated in the world around us. And that is all without even taking into account how video games allow for the more participatory form of objectification that weve been discussing in this episode.  Compounding the problem is the widespread belief that despite all the evidence exposure to media has no real world impact. While it may be comforting to think we all have a personal force field protecting us from outside influences this is simply not the case. Scholars sometimes refer to this type of denial as the third person effect which is the tendency for people to believe that they are personally immune to medias effects even if others may be influenced or manipulated. Paradoxically and somewhat ironically those who most strongly believe that media is just harmless entertainment are also the ones most likely to uncritically internalize harmful media messages.

Bonus fact Sandy Petersen creator of Call of Cthulhu is a practicing Mormon. Made for a funny exchange with John Romero when he was working at id Software as recorded in Masters of Doom.

However those skills could be reskinned to more appropriate skills. They also give rules for creating various types of vampires so those rules might theoretically be used to create other monsters but its been a while since I read that section so Im not positive its as flexible as I remember it.I have played Fear Itself but it was a purchased adventure and I havent studied things like their monster generation rules in depth.  My guess though based on your explanation  of what youre looking for is that Fear Itself is closer to what youre looking for on the character gen side at least.Another Gumshoe game along the same line that you might look at is Trail of Cthulhu.

Any reasonable DM should let you reroll under level  if you just arent having any fun with your class so I dont think it would be an issue of getting locked in before getting experienced with the flavor. I definitely think that the Soul Weapon of the base class seems a little overpowered. Possibly rework Wisdom of the Soul have it only give a bonus to weapon rolls if you are a Soulknife half bonus rounded up if you are Metaforge move the base class proficiency to light armor and give the Aegis and Metaforge proficiency with Medium Armor.,rpg,corlssf,1,t5_2qh2s

3227356,0,t3_2x39x2,That sounds like a pretty reasonable approach to take.  You could also give characters some sort of fatigue penalty if their combined work and monster hunting schedule prevents them from maintaining a decent sleep schedule.  It might also be worthwhile to come up with a mechanic with which character can be fired if they miss too many days or botch too many profession checks.  Lastly their occupation might also give them access to resources connections and knowledge that could conceivably come in useful with regards to monster hunting.  If a players occupation wouldnt give them access to anything useful then it might give them some other benefits such as more money or a particularly lenient boss.

No what my greatest villain was just a man with a taste for power and a mistaken belief that he was the full master of his own destiny.  Picture two Kingdoms long at peace with a big empire to the north who they have always fended off but between the two kings a long stretch of border marked by a small mountain and miles of trackless forests.   The kind of place that attracts bandits and rebels as a good place to set up shop in to attack nearby roads.  The campaign starts with one such foray by the party who have been hired by a friend of a friend to clear out one such camp by the local nobility.Their efficiency and accidental ruthless total bandit kill  Firebarrels of oil catches the attention of our villain Lord Wyton who happens to be the father of the current queen who along with her father does the day to day ruling of the country while her husband the King is busy drinking and boasting and being a jolly figurehead.Lord Wyton sends them on two more missions both of which were successful and again the third mission is an accidental murderfest as fight gets out of hand as while clearing a crooked merchants house in a border town several rare magical creatures get released to cause chaos which they do and keep doing until the party tracks two troublesome displacer beasts down and finishes them off.  Good for them... not so good for the four citizens it ate in the mean time. Lucky for the party Lord Wyton is very understanding and goes to bat for the party as the Mayor is pissed and wants them locked up.Now Ive given hints but until now Lord Wyton has been a serious and dour person whos speaks praise rarely and acts the disappointed father figure mostly.  When he went to bat for them and praised how noble the party was they loved him.  Unfortunately the partys trust was misplaced.For even now in the shadows Lord Wytons plan to unite two Kingdoms was in full swing.  After five or six sessions they were sent over to the neighboring Kingdom on loan as the Kingdoms best troubleshooters.  Monsters were slain threats were eradicated but in the streets men talked of rebellion.  Time and again unknowingly the party helped Lord Wytons plan to destabilizing the neighboring Kingdom as racial tensions were inflamed nobles were bribed caravans were turned back or vanished.The party for six months saw through only twice such scheme as once the bandits were only pissed off farmers mad that they were being taxed and the party diplomacy their way through it long enough to leave... only for taxes to go back up and the ringleaders quietly killed.  The second time a dangerous cult turned out to be a medieval larp session with really good props and the party only just stopped shy of dropping d damage worth in the middle of them.Six months in things are falling apart the population is in revolt and the villagers are trying to storm the castle but not to worry the party is here to help and Lord Wyton has set reinforcements!  Every single mage he can scrap together or anyone who holds any magical power is at their disposal the equivalent of  st nd and rd level npc magical users backed up by  of the Kings best guards are to take over for Kingdom Bs capital city watch since its entire senior staff turned rebel or died in the rioting.The party splits up to try and nonlethally defend the castle and get the force inside one of the city gates which the party manages to do both. And everything is looking up as the soldiers move in the mages move in and things calm down... just long enough for Lord Wytons right hand man to be escorted to the King make his welcome and slit King Bs throat as Lord Wytons Mage burnes King Bs wife and children.  Only one member of the party is present for this slaughter and its the fighter hes out numbered  to  and would have gone for his weapon but in the suprise round the entire royal family of Kingdom B died.  And hes left standing there as the Mage reads Lord Wytons thank you note to him and instructs him to tear down the cities gates set fire to her port pillage what they like and then leave.Shit gets real the fighter leaves without fighting only to round up the rest of the party and make tracks back to Kingdom A to sort out Lord Wytons shit.  They get back to the capital as Lord Wyton has spread the news that peace has been restored in Kingdom B and a grand ball is to be held that evening attendance is mandatory and the party arrives just as the ball kicks off at sundown.Every noble of note is in attendance every government functionary and the like is in attendance all eat and drink and dine to their hearts content the poison chosen was slow attacking and not necessarily deadly just inducing torpor and eventual unconsciousness.  The personal guards are all doused or killed and the hundred odd guests are bundled into the back of the room.  The party storms the castle only to be met by arrow fire and quickly seeks other ways in they fight through guardsmen they know soldiers they help trained and finally get in via a servants door one of them remembers seeing once.Storming to the throne room they pass by the ball room seeing each guest set head to toe in long rows on the floor but decide they can wait the throne room first and between one floor and the next the encounters stop the guards vanish and they climb the grand staircase with only the sounds of the city outside for company.They kick the doors in and there in the throne room is a pair of corpses and a note held forward in the Kings dead hands his wife the daughter of Lord Wyton slumped next to him.The note said simply If Party is reading this then good.  I wanted to thank you for your services to the Empire without your hard work none of this would have been possible.  I cant be there in person as I left two days ago for my new position up north.  By the way this room was warded when any of party came in my men in the ball room and castle cellars set put torches to the crates of alchemist fire at those locations.  Soon you should hear the explosions and then the city will burn and the last step will be complete my plan successful.The party was floored pissed and looking for blood the castle went up in flames and a dozen other spots in the city caught fire at the same time.  Almost instantly a firestorm hot enough to melt stone was burning and they barely escaped with their lives.One final note was left however for the party as they woke the next morning to find a messenger looking for them.If your reading this then you lived.  I know how resourceful you all are so dont worry.  I made sure that the crown jewels and personal treasury of King A hired only the very best in assassins.  In addition I ensured there are twenty witnesses who will swear on their lives that Fighter killed King B including his one surviving son.  Hes lost both his eyes to the fire but he tells all that his last sight was Fighter cutting his father head off as Sorcererburned him his mother and his brothers to their deaths.  The rest you did yourself with so publicly invading the castle just before it went up in flames. RegardsYour friendAnd that was how tens of thousands died and two kingdoms descended into full anarchy before the northern Empire swallowed them both up with only token resistance.,rpg,coxkdt1,50,t5_2qh2s

I expected the encounter to be pretty straightfroward but his casual demeanor around death wasnt villainous or evil...it was pragmatic. His cool confidence and psychopathic disregard for life really unsettled the players. It wasnt that he was a killer it was that he made it sound like the most obvious result of what happened. He asked the dwarves to travel through their city and they refused him  what other option did he have? As the players chased him throughout the world and destroyed his strongholds he became more and more frayed. Less cool and confident. More bitter instead of pragmatic.

Carrion Crawlers  They have  attacks per round each of them may paralyse a player for  turns. They arrive in packs of  meaning a whopping  to  attacks per round to paralyse everybody. They have  hit dice meaning they tend to hit even AC  percent of the time. And this is a standard monster from the basic set. Elves are not immune. Dragons  Aaaah. The dragons. They can use their breath attack three times a day. It does as much damage as it has hit points. As dragons breath usually will hit multiple party members and a dragon has more hit points than most heroes of the same level you can imagine the problem. But hey a successful saving throw will halve the damage. So you will propably die in round two or three. Energy Stealers  Which rpggroup ever used them? We didnt because reasons!

I think you made the right call on fade to black. I feel pretty sure now that this kind of universe is better served in an anonimous environment like second life or something. I think at this point that though the book sold for obvious reasons it has not made much of an impact on many games. This was my assumption but I didnt want to be the last to know if many players where adding this kind of mature content to games.

Youre terrified puts it out there and then allows them to work with it.In the second example theyre arguing with the rules but you may have some traction with a response like Okay I can see that whether you can or cant. How would your character react to this given theyve failed their throw?An example Ive often used to encapsulate this situation is as follows When youre playing James Bond the quintessential thing about him the very reason youre playing him is hes cool and self  assured. Now imagine a bad guy comes into the room and Lets say theres a fight and he rolls a one. If the GM says oooh you rolled a one and now your gun goes flying out of your hand like a  piece of soap and you stumble to the ground with a bucket stuck on your foot. Man you look like an idiot as the baddie stands over you laughing and knocks you out.Strictly speaking that may be a fair outcome for the fight but the description and the events totally negate Bonds cool and his cool is not whats on the line here.The correct outcome should be something that allows him to botch but only mechanically and leaves his coolness intact. An example might be. You duck under OddJobs lazy haymaker and drop him with a shot to the ribs. As he tumbles to the ground though he falls on you and before you can get loose you feel a sharp pain in your hand and glance over just in time to see a small blue dart as your vision begins to fade.Its not perfect but Bond loses the fight OddJob survives but Bond still looks cool.Even better though is to throw it over to the player and get them to describe what happens given theyve rolled the one.This aspect of the game was particularly important to me when I wrote Victoria You can even award plot point or XP or whatever for really creative descriptions of what bad stuff happens to their characters that they describe.,rpg,cpo87b1,4,t5_2qh2s

Eventually under fear of a bullet straight through their eyeball the players left and the bounty hunter ran a smear campaign showing them leaving the civilians to die.,rpg,cpudsgf,1,t5_2qh2s

The Catholics and Methodists have a huge chain of hospitals across the country.  I know the Catholics at least have said theyll shut down all the Catholic hospitals in the US before they perform a single abortion in one.When it comes to discriminating against transgenders gays and lesbians I d like some kind of official statement from the highest authority within a religious organization to come out publicly and state its acceptable to discriminate against gays.  Most groups wont do that because it will affect corporate donationsHeck the BSA is allowing gay eagle scouts because they cant afford the financial hit they took.Maybe the law should be modified to force you to register with the state state you beliefs and then you have to hang a sign in the window that says I discriminate against gay.

Usually most obvious when surrounded by a group that most enjoys playing challenge based games that dont emphasize roleplay.Nothing wrong with this type of play but the playstyle mismatch can cause some tension in the group.  My guess is that is the situation here based on your description.My suggestion is to give some of the story games a try such as Fate Core. Perhaps you may enjoy them.

3557941,0,t3_311062,I wanted to give one of my players a vision of doom where it felt intensely real.  The vision was that an enemy was coming and that this enemy was way too powerful.  The message The player had to prepare and prepare hard.In order to do that I had to get the other players to react to the deadly vision as though it were real.  Now if I go off into the other room with each of them that would tip my hand wouldnt it?  So I printed out  sheets of paper.  I handed them out saying Here is a quick overview of a recent event in the city.  Please read it real quick  and then well get started.The PlayertobeEnvisioned PtbE has just such an overview.  The rest of the players all get a page that reads The very next combat is fake.  It is a vision for PtbE he doesnt know it is a dream.  I need you all to react to this combat as though it were real and as frustrating as it will be as there is quite literally no way for you to win.  It is a nightmare after all.I put a lot of work into the wording so that at a distance the pages looked exactly the same including the same linebreaks and paragraph spacing.So I ask You guys ready? once theyve finished reading and then I say As youre walking through a parking garage you see... and their first encounter starts.The other players do a MAGNIFICENT job each one reacting quite poorly to not being able to hit and to being clocked handily.  Indeed one is acting so well I wonder if hes actually read the page I handed out.  When it finally gets down to PtbE he is so frustrated that he is fuming and saying whiningyelling Id like to hit him PLEASE! and I just have to shrug.The villain finally says Theres nothing you can do.  Your end is nigh and I say he raises his fist I roll dice and I say And you wake up.  You are in your room waking from a horrible nightmare.He did appreciate the level of thought I put into making this vision as impactful as I did but not at first. ,rpg,cpxtvpl,31,t5_2qh2s

How about these ideas The jury decides on a worldtrial. A sort of test that decides which way the world would swing. Maybe they even choose representatives from the world Or have the world leaders nominate reps who would undertake that test. Thats a campaign right then and there. The world goes into limbo or completely squashed. The polarized nature of the jury makes them believe that a world that isnt aligned either way is not worthy of ascension or descension.

I like the game well enough though it doesnt go far enough to scratch the mechanically complex itch that I have.

That was not my intent. What I meant was that I miss the complicated features. They werent just mechanics that bogged down the game. They actually enhanced my fun and I used them in particular not to powergame but to role play.gt we expressed our special snowflake status between the lines of the games mechanics. e presents backgrounds as a way to bring that imaginative play above board.Except thats not quite true. Youre still bound by the limited classes e currently has. If I want to play an alchemisttype of character then Im out of luck. The crafting game is also crazy expensive making potionbrewing pointless. That sucks for my current character whose major background involves potion brewing! Theres no way to legitimately express that without houseruling. e is bound by its own mechanics as well. I was no more limited in my imagination with Pathfinder than I am with e.

3827086,0,t3_345t3y,In one world I made there were only two kinds of elves though they might be more akin to sylphs. The setting was a series of floating tectonic plates that ranged from island to continent size think Earth but no water or traditional core and each plate had its own ecosystem and environment. They drifted along an invisible air current and were held somewhat in orbit around what looked like a mass of clouds and nothing.The first type of elves were the only race capable of natural flight their bodies were naturally part solid air. They werent intelligent per say like a human or traditional elf might be but they commanded the winds. Many elves were treated like sirens by the commoners said to lure all manner of people to their deaths by lulling them to dance with them on the winds. Indirectly this led to inventors of every civilization creating sky ships. Some captains were cruel and imprisoned elves on their ship to fill their sails while others treated them like Muses wooing and placating them into their charge and having them be honoured guests rather than driven slaves.The other kind of elf was starkly different. They possessed an intelligence akin to those of traditional elves and often interacted on even footing with the other sentient advanced races. In appearance you might think them more like half human spiders their skin was an ashy though powder light grey and their nails were black and chitinous. Their hair and eyes were often the same colour with the most common being a soft red and they often had slightly tougher skins. They avoided the other elves constantly preferring instead to make their homes in jungles and mountains occasionally even volcanoes. Lacking the natural flight of the sky elves these ones developed industry and had multiple scientific revolutions. Their ultimate invention was a portable re jetpack vortex machine which warped gravity to allow flight eventually outfitting ships with this to take to the skies.The reason why these elves avoided each other is because long ago as ancient catastrophes are want to be they were one. The sky elves represented all that was magically possible for the spider elves separated from them by meddling ork shamans who concocted a ritual to now and forever more sever the souls of elves  out of jealousy of course.,rpg,cqsiq5k,2,t5_2qh2s

3879918,0,t3_34v5lw,The market is different these days than it was. The short answer is it is easier than ever to do this but still not exactly a good way to make a living.Theses days most publishers only hire writers freelance. Publishers that do employ a regular staff are employing people who the know can sell books.I only know two people personally who make their living off writing gaming materials. One is Ken Hite. He also has a wife who provides health insurance. Together they make a comfortable middle class living. The other is Keith Baker. I know less about Keiths living situation but they are both happy healthy dudes.You can totally be a freelancer. I know plenty of people who do that make money and love the hell out of it. To get a freelance position you need to know people. Thats not too hard. You can easily connect with industry personalities at conventions. They are nice they want to see the industry grow and they are willing to help  of the time.If you have a place your work can be seen be sure to point it out to your new industry buddies. If people know you do good work they will bring work to you. Dont be afraid to ask for opportunities. When you do gt work deliver copy on time clean and within parameters. Do that and guess what? You are a freelance that people like to work with! That means you are a freelancer who has work.None of that should dissuade you. You just need to rethink what a career in gaming means. It would not be your only job. It could still be rewarding emotionally and financially.These days there is not a single reason to go though the old publishing system. It never worked for gaming to begin with. If you want to design in sell games you can do it independently and preferably digitally.Kickstarter and Indiegogo are how the industry works now. All the big publishers use them Steve Jackson Atlas Catalyst ect. All of the cool independants do it Keith Baker Will Hindmarch John Harper Marissa Kelly EVERYONE.This is a reallygood thing. If you have an idea that has a potential audience you can make it happen. Thats American as fuck.The active part of that sentence is can. Kistarter and its various clones are full of good ideas but it takes work to be noticed. To make a game through kickstarter you need to put in the work to buld an audience.The easiest way to get a project funded is to already have a a successful Kickstarter. The second is be a well known game industry personality.Thats a sucky thing to hear until you think about how small this industry is. Game kickstarters that make tens of thousands need only a couple hundred to fund. Less if you are going all digital.If you are going into self publishing Id advise you to start small. Design some micro games share them here or on other forums. Build a following based on free or pay what you want micro stuff. David Schirduan Grant Howett and John Harper did this and it worked for them. David is a work in progress but in a few months when he launches Mytic Mortals everyone is going to back it because of the work he is putting in now.You can see success without being known beforehand. The ladies behind WITCH ran a killer campaign by giving a press packet of their game to blogs and podcasts.Podcasts are a great tool for building your reputation or promoting your Kickstarter. The stupid assholes who run these shows cultivate audiences of thousands for no money. Ad time is cheap engagment is high and there are tons of shows that can produce episodes specifically about you and your product. They are so starved for legitimacy just approaching them as though they are real media figures can win you tweets and mentions.You know what though? Those free and pay what you want micro games I told you to make? They are ALL you need to be a legitimate designer. If you write a game that is just a single sentence long you are a game designer. If you put it online you are a published designer. That simple.The last thing Ill say is there is plenty of room in this industry for more jobs around gaming that are not simply producing games. Look for a niche and fill it.Good luck!,rpg,cqyjm2y,7,t5_2qh2s

3893290,0,t3_350hxg, havent watched the video yetI think the primary reason people do alignment wrong is they dont get how it works.The only thing your alignment is is if rocks fall RIGHT NOW which plane in the afterlife would you go to?  that and determining things like does smite evil work on you.So a model citizen that set fire to a building he didnt know was an orphanage would be going to an evil plane if rocks fell until he got a atonement spell on him or otherwise made up for it. Alignment is made to move yet most players make their personality an alignment. Your personality should be a set of things you will or wont do under certain circumstances. These sets of things might overlap with a LG ideology but you can still go Evil or Chaotic with them due to circumstances. If your character doesnt move alignment over the course of a long campaign chances are nothing ever changed for your character and you didnt have to make any difficult decisions.,rpg,cr02htr,2,t5_2qh2s

3940918,0,t3_35kxog,As has been said by others the wheel of time is one of the best Ive ever read.There is also the witch war series by James Clemens.  Brutal and definitely for a more mature audience the characters are so empathetic and genuine its hard not to think of them as real.  With this story every step forward costs something of equal or greater value.Brandon Sanderson has several novels that are amazing most notably the mistborn series which he eventualy turned into an RPG on its own.  but dont forget Elantris which I always felt like deserved sequels.E.E. Knights The age of fire is a fantastic set of novels.  Shorter than what I usually go for but with an amazingly different perspective on the fantasy genre.  Terry Brooks is a prolific writer with an expansive world of novels of them I recommend The Voyage if the Jerle Shannara set.  Wizards First rule by Terry Goodkind is phenomenal it even had a try as a tv seriesFor something a little on the lighter side Terry Pratchet is one of the funniest writers Ive had the pleasure of reading.  Specifically Hogfather The thief of time Small Gods and Mort are top of my list.There is also the Dresden Files By Jim butcher.  A more modern fantasy written in a sort of episodic manner with each book sort of standing on its own telling one story from a modern day wizards prospective.  After  years of exploring the genre these authors stand out in memory as the best I have come across and can highly recommend.  If you have the time and want to sink into a big project start with the wheel of time.  without a doubt one of the best ever written however if you arnt ready for a commitment to  novels plus a prequel then I would point first to James Clemens and the witch war series or Brandon Sandersons Mistborn novels.  These three authors changed how I see the fantasy world more than any other.,rpg,cr5hy9c,3,t5_2qh2s

3948418,0,t3_35n9no,Im currently in one campaign and just ended another a couple of days ago. The one that ended was on HERO in the GMs own world the one thats still going is Edge of the Empire. The HERO campaign was a bit like a chooseyourown adventure novel with only one ending. We could do more or less whatever we wanted live or die but there was one way it was going to turn out because the GM couldnt risk us breaking his world. This was really frustrating in several instances most notably where a character named Loop got into a fight over a woman that he was given every opportunity to solve peacefully. He went for a fools stance on his longsword holding it with both hands behind his head and bringing it down with all of his strength. He rolled something like a  on d where lower is better. His opponent was not wearing armor. This should have been a oneshot but he actually ended up losing the fight to Rule . No one came out of that session happy.The EotE campaign is pretty much the complete opposite. At the end of a session the GM will ask the captain where hes going to go the captain will consult Wookiepedia and the crew and the GM will read up on the setting before the next session. Since Disney bought LucasArts in the middle of the campaign we arent too afraid to break canon so our end goal is likely to be killing Darth Vader so my Gand technician can use his lightsaber as a multitool.Id have to say that I prefer the second campaign.

So it makes the hit seem much less impactful. And yeah but the players have control over the story by virtue of being the players. Negating a GM Intrusion is just the narrative equivalent of But that didnt really happen did it?  which would work great if the narrative framework was were telling you a story that already happened but is just awkward in your standard framework. And its not like a GM Intrusion would have much of an overall impact anyway solely because the GM isnt going to plan any major events as an Intrusion else they run the risk of someone negating it. I dunno the entire structure seems like its at this really awkward point between letting the GM have primary narrative control and letting the players assume some narrative control beyond just being players  but because the GM determines when the players get minor narrative control it effectively destroys that portion because most GMs arent going to willingly give up narrative control at points where thatd actually have much of an overall impact.

4097517,0,t3_37jub1,It is widely suspected that The Deed of Paksenarrion by Elizabeth Moon is based on an actual ADampD Campaign. This is most obvious in the nd Book which includes several sections that are straight out dungeon delves. And even further the main plot is pretty much ADampD Module T but with all the names changed and NPCs significantly expanded. The Main character follows a standard ADampD progression of being a fighter who then becomes a Paladin and exhibits a set of powers consistent with thous an ADampD Paladin would have.

Rape and suicide are traumatic and not automatically associated with dungeons in RPGs so it makes sense to warn for that. On the other hand supernatural horrors is silly to mention as that is not something people in general might face in their life. I am not talking about babyproofing every little thing any person could possibly fear just offering a courtesy to people who have been through some particularly harsh shit in their life.gtI would submit that either theyre all justified or that none of them are. That is a falsedichotomy. I would rather have some kind of standard Strong Content Warning where there is a clear list of stuff that people warn about like on a videogame or film rating label. Then it would make sense to mention graphic violence but every dungeon would probably have that. Rape and Suicide would also be on the list and probably graphic sexual content would also be there.

I mean the mecha pilots in that world are highly trained soldiers not investigators or members of an occult conspiracy. True you can technically be a investigator or a conspirator that can drive a mecha...but the stats for a mecha is so different than a normal human that unless everyone is capable of driving a mecha which would essentially make it into a mecha campaign it wouldnt work out. Its like the horseback knight going to a underground dungeon.One must ask if you are capable of driving a  meter killing machine do you need to train more than minimum on other combat stuff? If you put situations that require players to go out of the mecha too much is that a mecha campaign or a soldiering campaign arent you losing focustheme of the campaign? At least this is my opinion.   Now granted there are something called power suits which are essentially small mechas of human size that kinda bridges the gap between the two.

Without having rigorous rules about whether she can do this or that she might really enjoy that kind of activity instead of ruining everyone elses time. Dont play with her. Gaming is not for everyone and it seems shes one of those other people. In this hobby you have to be able to work within a group. If she cant play with others she dont belong in this hobby. Explain to everyone that the goal of a roleplaying game is the entertainment of everyone. If one players actions this includes the GMs are infringing on the enjoyment of another they need to back the heck off and do something different. I heard about something called X carding where each player gets a card with an X on it. If at any point during play you really truly dont like something you hold up your card. The game grinds to a halt and rewinds until you present an alternate course of events that avoid the objection and the matter is not up for discussion probing or ridicule.

4193484,0,t3_38vpg0,I got far too carried away writing thisConsidering fiction is a cycle of reusing and repurposing other bits and pieces of preexisting material Im not ashamed to admit that almost everything I come up with is based off of movies TV shows video games books comics anime music or even the ingredients list on a Doritos bag long story short I thought about yogurt when I was reading it and I thought about a tribe of sapient cheeseproducing fungus people being kept as a slave race to produce food for a human colony.What I do most often is take a story Im inspired by and break it down into its basic parts and then I do that to a bunch of other stories. Then Im left with a big bin of Legos to make whatever I want with.As an example of something I made I took Assassins Creed and decided the idea of two huge historical groups fighting over the fate of humanity was an interesting concept. I also decided that having to live the lives of multiple people to uncover the whole truth of something without the people who youre eavesdropping on ever finding out themselves was interesting.I then needed to figure out what those groups would be. I decided I wanted something mildly horror based on our Earth so I took the SCP Foundation and made a similar organization also known as the Foundation be one of the groups. Their goal is to keep humanity in the dark about the true nature of the world by locking away everything supernatural in origin.Their rival group would be a smaller offshoot that wants to use the supernatural stuff to forcefully create world peace through the threat of annihilation if you dont join their new world order. I decided they would be called the Watch because its ominous.Next I decided three groups is better than two so I made another group that wants to destroy everything supernatural to keep the world a simpler place. Theyre the Collective. Theyre occasional allies with the Foundation.Now I needed something for the players to do. I decided that since Im going with the idea of multiple people who all experience small portions of the overall story and there are people who see things through the eyes of those multiple people that Id have multiple campaigns thatre all somewhat short and the players are those viewing through others eyes. Thats what were really doing anyway isnt it?Since I needed a reason for these three groups to not have succeeded in their goals I made the world a messy place of politics and deception by borrowing from the Metal Gear series. I also decided for the sake of having some fun plot twists would happen regularly but be heavily foreshadowed.Next I needed to give each campaign its own feel so they werent the same. I went through various cheesy creepypasta websites and threw together some notsocheesy horror plots from those in the style of Silent Hill  and . Very personal stories.At this point I decided I wanted to make these campaigns span a wide range of time periods so I have some campaigns take place in the th century and some in the nd century and many times in between. Since we have eldritch horrors and advanced secret societies I figured time travel would be a must. This also allows for events in the future to impact the past so the campaigns dont have to be done in chronological order and my players can choose.Since I know that I want anything to be able to change at any time in any campaign I decided to take inspiration from Deus Ex Mass Effect and Heavy Rain. With Deus Ex anything is possible at any time but its not a sandbox. Theres rails theres just hella switchtracks. With Mass Effect your choices in one game carry over to the other games I know its different in this case since its a different character every campaign but still. With Heavy Rain you can die and thats a perfectly valid choice.To portray the eldritch horrors I decided to take inspiration from LSD Dream Emulator and from some videos I saw about corrupting retro video games. I wanted a feeling of something being the natural twisted into the unnatural. Dreams seemed perfect for this so I also used the presentation of Inception to make sure the dream message got across. This ties in nicely with the Silent Hill motif I mentioned before.Now I said this before but I didnt really answer. What would the players do? Since I want personal stories I need personal goals. We have dreamlike horrors and a Silent Hill vibe. The players need to escape so thats a goal. But how does that help the playerswhich are supposed to be getting pieces of a story through others viewpointsunderstand whats going on? As bizarre as this sounds I decided Ace Attorney was the answer.In Ace Attorney you need to get your client not guilty. You do that by clicking the right buttons at the right points over and over until you get to the end. So you can play through by brute force without understanding any of it but it will take you forever.If you pay attention to all the clues though they point you into a much easier path and those clues are laced with all the story. The instructions and the story are one and the same. So thats what I did Every clue puzzle NPC prop everything all of it is both a means to help the characters escape and is a part of the overall picture the players are supposed to be getting.So far Ive gotten some positive reactions. One player told me it inspired them to do something similar to it which is cool and several players have told me it was really interesting to play a story that jumps around history and to have their former characters show up older or younger than they remember them and to follow NPCs throughout their lives as a different person every time.On the other hand some people have told me it was confusing and complicated or that they didnt like the idea of having to change characters and thus lose everything they just learned. Thats of course leaving out unrelated criticism such as there being very little combat and issues with pacing or other such stuff. Its all perfectly valid everyone likes different stuff.In conclusion I think Im addicted to the sound of my own typing. But it was fun writing out my thought process.,rpg,cry97mp,46,t5_2qh2s

4203409,0,t3_390szh,Personally Id suggest Anima Beyond Fantasy. Its more geared towards DBZ style combat with the addition of magic and psionics so it can handle the kinds of battles the characters would have against the angels pretty easily.The religion and psychology angles would need to be covered by the GM yourself but considering those aspects of systems tend to be quite isolated from the rest of the system you can probably pull the psychology straight out of call of cthulhu and import it in with very little modification. You might have to increase the values of penalties and such but thats about it for the most part and really cthulhus about what youre looking for when it comes to the type of psychology involved with in evangelion  youre not looking for a fullblown psychological profile or even anything particularly accurate or realistic just something that feels like a horror movie is all. Evangelions method of psychology especially the last two episodes before the multitude of remakes is... below amateur work. It was written by an insane man not someone who studies the insane. PAs such just pick a horror game with a psychology section lift that entirely and drop it into a game which can support over the top combat. If the players are playing characters which command enslaved giants into combat fully possible in anima they may very well not get the Evangelion reference PId also suggest reading a lot of the background stuff about evangelion  theres a ton of complex and important information that makes the series make that much more sense but which never gets mentioned in the actual show because the characters simply never run into a situation where theyd learn that information such as the origin of adam and eve or why the angels are fighting them at all or why there arent angels already native on the earth. They dont even explain what the firstsecond impacts were angels colonized Terra first then humanity did after which wiped out the angels.The extra material explains a lot more and makes the series take on a whole new meaning when you see what was going on behind the scenes so Id highly recommend looking up that information as you could probably introduce it into your game which would further make it harder to notice its evangelion P And make the story stronger as a bonus  ,rpg,crzdnvh,2,t5_2qh2s

If that happened in a baseball game the amount of anger expressed by everyone playing would be ostracizing.  It should be likewise here.tldr  Sorry dude.

4241765,0,t3_39iu5d,Throwing them in jail after the fight and then having the Mayor offer them a pardon in exchange for a favour could be one way to go. The nature of the favour needs to be one that the party wouldnt outright offend the party  so it would seem reasonable but have deeper significance.To keep the PCs on the Mayors leash though you either need to convince them that the Mayors guards andor mercenaries are scary enough that running isnt an option. Or by ransoming some piece of valuable equipment or something that the PCs cant live without a familiar is ALWAYS a good choice for this.So some example tasks the Mayor might have them do Get rid of a pesky rivals who are trying to get in on the extortion racket. This works because even if the PCs try to double cross their Mayor they are just putting another villain in power and there is nothing stopping the new guy from doubletriple crossing the PCs that helped him get power! Fetch quests with a sting. By this I mean any variation on the theme of Retrieve item X Item X is actually part of a larger scheme and will be used to harm others. You can put an additional sting in the tail by having the Mayor plan for the PCs to fail this  usually by way of having the item stolen from the PCs thus leaving the PCs further indebted to the Mayor.Of course the latter plays well for Machiavellian villains and the former is great for moral dilemmas. The benefit to either is that if youre looking to have the PCs liberate the town from Mayor and his cronies they have every opportunity if you string them along. ,rpg,cs3r4f7,2,t5_2qh2s

4322695,0,t1_cscaknt,You know your players best but...that doesnt sound like supportive playing to me. My first and so far only experience running a game was for my group went very smoothly and I had two GMs in my group. Neither overruled anything I said and no one ignored consequences at a player level at the character level yes  I was running a modified version of We Be Goblins and Goblins arent great at understanding cause and effect  but the players all acknowledged the consequences I put into play. My group did a great job of biting the plot hooks I provided them probably partially because they knew it was my first time GMing. There was no PvP or attempt at removing other players agency but that stuff doesnt normally fly at our table anyway.From your description of your first session I get the feeling that your GM was using their authority as most experienced GM to bend the game in the way they wanted and possibly to extract some revenge on a problematic player. Generally the game world isnt a good place for a player to express frustration with another player  let alone the game world of a new GM or within a GMplayer power differential. Your other players also seem to have pushed the envelope during that game. That kind of player behavior is quite difficult to handle in general  we see posts about it on here all the time  so it seems particularly stressful and uncalled for in a new GMs first game.Obviously you get to decide what you think of your experience GMing and what you think of your players and their behavior. The purpose of my post is NOT to try and get you to try it again. If GMing isnt comfortable for you dont do it. But I think your players couldve made it easier on you and wanted to point that out.

4362931,0,t3_3az16u,I think its hilarious that people are being all snobby and telling you that playing a female NPC is no different than playing a male NPC.  Sure maybe if the NPC is utterly trivial but since most players are straight males female NPCs offer the possibility of romantic storylines and those can be very awkward.I dont feel comfortable flirting with my male players.  Its weird it makes everyone at the table uncomfortable.  So I generally roleplay those kinds of scenarios from what I call one step remove  that is I discuss her actions and what she says in the third person and tend to use a lot of description and summary.For example a major NPC in my current game is a woman named Seeta Zadi.  Heres her character sheet.  Shes a classic Femme Fatale and uses seduction and her sexuality to get what she wants  and what she wants is one of the player characters.  One of the players is playing a disgraced foreign nobleman turned assassin and hes been investigating Seetas friends.  She clues in to this and decides she wants to get to know him and when she learns hes a contract killer who supposedly murdered his own father shes intrigued.It would be weird to try to seduce the player especially since the player is a  year old dude and Im a  year old fat guy with a beard.  So instead I describe her actions like so  As you enter the ballroom you catch the eye of Seeta Zadi and she smiles towards you with a mischeavious gleam in her eyes.  She sashays across the floor to you her graceful movements proving a distinct tightening in your pants.  When she reaches you she places her hand gently on your arm and her touch is electric.  She leans in close and you can feel her warm breath on your ear as she says Its so good to see you again.  Make a Charm roll to say something that doesnt embarrass you both.I never ask the player to try to flirt with me or imagine me as Seeta.  Its all carefully framed as an encounter between the characters mediated through dice rolls.,rpg,cshfq9o,5,t5_2qh2s

IMO GURPS is a great system for any GM willing and wanting to put in the extra effort to really customize their game.

4404416,0,t3_3bgpeo,As anyone who has worked on a puzzle game like Myst will tell you its near impossible to predict what will or wont be obvious.The problem is that if you follow the same line of reasoning as the puzzle creator the GM in this case it will be easy. If you dont it will be hard. This means even the most challenging and complex of puzzles you make will still be easily solved on a whim with little to no difficulty sometimes and sometimes the most blatantly obvious will go right over peoples heads as they overthink it or follow a different path of logic.In the end no matter how obvious you think something is it very well may not be. Intelligent play doesnt really work so well due to such in many cases. You can still reward players for coming up with intelligent ways to avoid a situation but unless youre playing something like shadowrun where the whole point of the game is to case the place for a week before doing anything dont expect a lot of thought in advance. P   You can tell your players to treat the game as though it were shadowrun but the games mechanics may not support that style of play.Overall its just generally easier to make it very clear what you expect of the players to a degree. It doesnt mean tell them to case the place for a week but if theyre going in blind before they get there its typically a good idea to put in one last are you really sure you want to stick your hand in the blender? Press Y for yes. moment.As for rules lawyering well when people start panicking that theyre going to lose a character theyre attached to theyll use any method available from pleading with the GM trying to bribe the GM or arguing with the GM about obscure rules that miiiight be able to wiggle them out of it.And yeah you want your players to be afraid of death and you want to smack them upside the head when they screw up. If its the first offense though and otherwise it sounded like they were fine up until everything went to hell generally itd be worth giving them a mulligan of sorts. They should still be penalized for running off blindly but deaths a bit much for the first offense. Even if it is warhammer. PAnyway for improvement? Just assume that they may think of things from a different perspective. Anything you THINK is obvious probably isnt because you know what youre looking for. Theyre looking at the situation in a totally different light and may very well view that as simply having wiped out the first group didnt think the cultists had expected them to find the secret elevator the empty next elevator confirmed that for them in that theyd probably killed everything and the lack of traps suggested they didnt think anyone would get that far and therefore they were totally off guard when it turns out they had been expecting such when everything in their minds pointed to the party being the ones to successfully nail their ambush.As you can see its all about interpretation. Intelligent play is also a very vague term  is it intelligent to jump into the unknown? Mmm depends. If they do their research the chances are the baddies will find out and have more time to prepare traps and such. If they barge in first thing they have the element of surprise presumably which may give them a bigger edge than knowing what theyre up against. Its practically a flip of the coin which is going to be more effective so both have their strategic merits and both are intelligent in their own right. It really just depends largely upon whether they expect there to be a need for more information or not. If they dont expect to find a greater daemon at the bottom of a low end cult then they probably dont need to bring anything particularly specialized and a blitzkrieg style attack is probably the better choice. If they stop to ask around that may give the cultists time to finish summoning such a greater daemon so whats the right answer? They dont know and the act of asking makes the question a moot point in such a situation.So there you go. I cant give much for specific advice other than if youre certain theres a major problem with them running in then theyve probably been misled somehow whether intentional or not. Just tossing an NPC up before they start the assault who mentions theres some terrible secret in the place they need to research first will tend to fix that. Yeah its a minor deus ex machina but a minor nudge like that tends to allow for longer more fun campaigns than oh hellbunnies Ive stepped on a landmine where its already too late by the time they get their first clue it was a mistake.Then again some people like highfatality campaigns where the slightest screwup leads to oblivion.

4408550,0,t3_3bi6wl,Hmmm. Could you elaborate on what youre looking for? From your prompt I take it youre looking for some form of a personality test that doesnt appear to be a personality test that will determine what decks they get.     What if they went to a museum? There are a large number of archetypes that can correspond to what they saw in the museum. Or if this is avoiding archetypes it can still correspond to card types.     For example you ask a player You enter the museum and see two wings in front of you and two to the sides. To the left is the Ancient History wing while to the right is the Modern wing. To the Far left is the Animal Habitat complex and to the far right is a special exhibit wing containing exhibits on superstitions and pop culture. Where do you want to go first?    From there you can narrow down the characters interests For example they pick the Hall of Animals go to look at the woodland mammals and end up with a racoonbeast deck.     Obviously this would require a fairly large amount of prep work to create an accurate verbal description of a museum but I think its a fun way for your characters to interact without it being obvious that youre trying to gauge their deck habits. If you need further information have them fill out a museum survey at the end that asks them what their favorite exhibit was and why. Then keep the museum as a recurring location. Have them meet people in the museum. Dont use it as a oneanddone event. Keep it as part of your RPG. Maybe the museum director is a duelist as well. Maybe people are using the museum as a drop point for a smuggling ring. Having an established location that the players feel like they know builds up a world that they can explore.,rpg,csmku0h,2,t5_2qh2s

You can also play as a completely nonphysical character as a digital entity called an infomorph.What this means is that your physical stats are essentially treated as gear.

There is a  percent chance that they will go completely offscript deviating from all your carefully arranged encounters but they wont know it! The sign of a great DM in my opinion is being able to adapt and improvise so well that they dont even know theyre not doing what they were supposed to be doing.My first time DMing a Dark Heresy game my PCs had to infiltrate a hereticheld sector of a city and abduct a heretic leader for questioning. They were supposed to do it by stealth. Instead they crashed an APC through a barricade did a smash and grab kidnapping and led the heretic forces on a high speed chasegunfight through half of the city.

What kills it for me is the morality mechanics especially in the vampire games. I acknowledge that the game needs some method of reinforcing that the more corrupt you become the further away from humanity you drift and are closer to a wild animal than a person. However I really hate the restrictions it puts on a character. Your morality stat is too high for your character to consider that a viable option. If I want my character to be OK with murdering pedophiles in cold blood but not anyone else why cant I do that without getting mechanically punished for it? It makes it feel like only morally simple characters are allowed and that the players are actively punished for not adhering to what the game thinks is acceptable.Personally Id rather gut the morality mechanics all together and keep the rest but its so woven into the rest of it all that it would take a complete overhaul of the rules for much of it to still make sense.

Having someone there will make what you are talking about more understandable because they can act as a  pseudo audience asking questions and bringing up points that are not clear in your talk.. Listening to one person talk is not as interesting as listening to a dialogue. There is a reason the two people talking format is so popular in podcasts and there are very few if any highly rated podcasts that are a solo speaker. Those that are are often very highly produced podcasts done by journalists and the like. It gives a way for you to come up with material and discussion points while doing the cast. In Many of the two people talking podcasts I listen to it is not uncommon for the hosts to come up with the next weeks topics while they are talking. . Having an other voice allows for differing in opinions on topics GMing is not math there is no correct way to GM. Having an other voice on the matter makes your message appear less This is the only way to do it and more here is some good advice. . Having an other person work with you will make you more accountable and make you more likely to make more than  shows and then abandon the project.Those are just a selection of the reasons while it is possible for you to do it alone you will have to work harder to reach the same level of quality.Best of Luck.,rpg,cswg37k,2,t5_2qh2s

4497871,0,t3_3codct,A friend and I planned out dual characters for a Pathfinder game.  Theyre names were Grik and Grak and were chaotic good goblins. Since goblins in Pathfinder were all chaotic evil we took a penalty to the duo by makeing their eyes blue. This caused other goblins and evil creature to know we were different and would attack us if they noticed  but good characters and creatures still saw us as goblins and would fear or try to kill us.To get past this Grik was a rogue and Grak was a fighter. Grik had a very high disguise score and would stand on Graks shoulders while wearing a cloak any time were were in public. We would have rolled synchronization rolls to make sure we were acts together and not being suspicious. The GM would have decided on the difficulty of said rolls.As long as our our disguise and sync checks were good  if a fight broke out Grik would throw off the cloak and jump off Graks shoulders catching everyone who didnt beat our disguise check by suprise instant flat footed. Grak would pretty much always have his massive for him broad sword at the ready under the cloak just incase a defense or surprise attack was in needed.We worked out too that Grik and Grak would constantly bicker with each other outside of disguise  but functioned perfectly as a unit when in disguise. We even made a fake Goblin gibberish we would have yelled at each other in if we ever got to play the characters.I still have both character sheets and plan in incorporating then as NPCs in a game Im writing write now,rpg,csxm1u0,17,t5_2qh2s
4499170,0,t1_csxqgxw,It doesnt have to be a control thing. If you think of it as more of a neutral creator role you simply cause things to appear and then they take on a life of their own. Its like a deist point of view. You create and then sit back and watch things happen. Sure you have to make things move a bit more than in the real world unless Im in the Truman Show but you could be acting them out as they would happen in this fantasy world not merely to push the characters into situations that have already been created. Some GMs and some players like the onthefly stuff better than having situations which must happen. If you dont do anything to stop the evil villain he may very well take over the world. That doesnt mean the world stops existing unless that was his plan but thats such a lame evil villain plan that really makes not much sense if you want the villain to have actual motivations beyond evil. That doesnt mean the story has to be over. Journey not the destination type thing.And players also create. They can create encounters. How? Attack a town guard. How could the GM respond? Well its a guard so they would attack back. There you have a combat encounter not created by the GM. Like almost all relationships its a giveandtake not one person dictating what happens and a lot of people want that relationship to be one of equals. Its collaborative storytelling.

But beyond that this excuse is the fault of the DM in my opinion. If a player is doing it just to be an asshole tell them to leave. Because theyre hurting the game and wasting the time of the players who are invested in the world. BUT if theyre actually doing what their character would do for good or ill and its causing a headache thats STILL on the dm at one of two points. Either. This character was problematic and shouldnt have been allowed Im a demonic witch in a party of holy roller paladins crusaders monks and clerics! Muahahaha! or it wasnt discussed in depth between player and dm so the underlying issues were never made apparent. . The dm might not be flexible enough to deal with actions beyond their thought tunnel. The rogue decides to sneak into the castle? Think about what realistic checks and balances they might encounter and execute. Thats the dms main job. The druid decides to lay waste to the city because they encroached on the forest?

4526467,0,t3_3czibg,Could we get a brief rundown of the mechanics? What is the a core resolution mechanic? Is it roll some dice add them together to beat a target number like DampD or dice pool like WoD or Shadowrun or tiered results like AW or DW or roll under typically percentile system like Warhammerk? Where is it on the scale of ruleslite to crunchy? Does the system have narrative elements and how inherent are they? Like DampD has few narrative elements in the mechanics whereas Fate or AW has narrative elements built into the actual rolls. Is it mostly a straight up good vs evil idea? Is there some moral grey such as is our totalitarian government unjust even thought it protects against the Horde type questions? Is the game mostly power fantasy where we gradually win against the demon Horde or is it a game of despair where despite the partys success other battles fail and the Horde slowly encroaches further and further? Or something else or between these two extremes? Is there freeform magic or strict spell lists? Mana points or Vancian magic or infinite casting? Are characters just ratings in those  stats and a level or rank? Do you have skills talentsfeatsmerits powers moves aspects etc etc?Im not saying a game needs or should have something from every list but it would help to have a brief rundown of what is in your game.EGgtDampD is typically a power fantasy game where players triumph against great evil although stories can easily vary from this baseline. It is a d game where players try to roll above a GM assigned target number to succeed at tasks. It is somewhat crunchy and has a lot of options due to expanded source material. Players typically pick a class and as they level up and gain skills feats and class features which make them more powerful or versatile. There are spell lists which are prepared in a Vancian manner. Narrative is driven mostly by the players rather than mechanics  the mechanics are there to resolve uncertain situations not dictate the story.orgtWorld of Darkness is a game of urban fantasy and personal horror where players typically struggle against both external threats and inner turmoil. You can play as either a mortal or a supernatural being although typically all the PCs are of the same type. It is a not overly crunchy dicepool game using ds. Players spend experience points directly on improving their character rather than an abstract level up system. There are some narrative elements in the game including a morality system and some merits with more narrative rather than mechanical effects  furthermore the newest edition has conditions which players can gain or lose which sometimes incentivise allow or even force certain types of character behavior. Some supernatural beings have set power lists and many powers require a manalike resource to use however Mages have freefrom casting which again sometimes uses mana.,rpg,ct175y3,3,t5_2qh2s

4589935,0,t3_3du175,TORG. Without question. It is the only pen and paper RPG that adequately resembles a core part of cinematic drama the heroes are at their most powerful right when they need to be with the villain in sight and when all seems lost. Almost every other game has resources hit points spells drama dice karma points that are spent to get deeper into the session. The characters are most powerful right before theyve done anything and surviving a session is a game of attrition.TORG fixes this with the Drama deck. The deck handles initiative unexpected plot twists and actually makes it so that less important scenes are less challenging where the Final Encounter is when everything seems to go wrong building tension. Standard scenes provide opportunities for the players to draw additional cards while taking actions and play the less powerful ones from their hands to sculpt a strong hand to support tactics and dice rolls for that last big fight. In Dramatic Scenes a player can have their moment of crisis where the camera zooms in and all the focus is on them any cards they receive from other players support and leadership actions as well as their entire hand can be dumped to support one big roll.The music swells the villain is about to escape unless that oneinamillion shot strikes true. The hero lines up his aim hearing his good buddy say You got this kid the love interest says quietly We all believe in you. No one takes a breath as all the years of training come down to this. This. One. Shot. It hits home and the world is saved.In TORG you can do that.

4695786,0,t1_ctlp6tz,Well for one they eliminated the Shadow concept as a player. They divided the living and the dead into four distinct groups each with their own pros and cons actual ghosts still have a Shadowstyle thing called a Doppelganger but the ST controls it and its got its own agenda and plasmic body. The setting is updated heavily focusing more on the existence of corporations that exist to interact and utilize the dead for their own means. The Shadowlands are gone and ghosts exist in the Skinlands now which makes it much easier for the dead to interact with the living. The setting is also considerably less existential and closer to the bone in its bleakness.The rules they changed were basically OWoDs clunky combat system awkward pointbuy powersets and dumpstat Abilities. Everything is pretty useful now and there is viability for a new army of builds. Likewise they integrate the Nature and Demeanor system into the actual character specs so theres a much deeper integration between character crunch and character fluff.All said and done I came to love Orpheus for grabbing Wraith by the throat shoving it through the Shroud and screaming THERE!

If you havent seen it I heartily recommend it. Best line in the movie? Possibly this Car!If it is the first or early in the process of training supers youll get a pretty standard boot camp for supers. I imagine that the first aid classes might cover slightly more than what is usual  particularly with regards to how one may render first aid to people with unusual abilities  and that youll get officer classes and private classes in small arms tactics and so on.For those with powers that go to superstrength or otherwise with a significant chance of collateral damage youll probably have both Combat Engineer training in order to divert floods fortify quickly and efficiently and to identify weak spots in enemy fortifications and some significant training in law because if you deviate from the rules of engagement you can be in big trouble.I imagine that your platoon might be divided into units hero teams and that you may have people being assigned to support healers buffers logistics fliers teleporters assault bricks energy blasts and defense force fields mind shielding.You might also have a scout element stealth invisibility intangibles and you might have specialist detachments for the oddballs able to summon  ft tall robot rabbits able to convert body hair to antimatter that may temporarily be assigned as an op develops.Much of the training will be for officers to give orders for grunts to take orders and to coordinate and maintain unit cohesion and tactical overview under adverse conditions.,rpg,ctmpjhi,4,t5_2qh2s

To do that would come off as incredibly cheap and obvious.But if instead you let them wander and preferably after some unrelated adventuring have them find an etched stone pillar covered in complex machinery that depicts a Dwarf using the heart to control an army of mechanical soldiers the players might go Oh right!

I think it is kinda hard to put into words. Its just a lot of small things. The first thing to note is that his style has a very player vs DM feel to it. There were so many conflicts in Solum where they disagreed on things compared to basically none in the other shows. At times it really felt like Neal thought he needed to kill some PCs to keep things interesting so they were put in situations where one of them was very likely to die.Personally though my dislike stems from the way he plays his games. I am almost completely sure that he fudges his die rolls and does a fair amount of railroading to keep the players on the story. Now dont get me wrong fudging and railroading is completely fine if your players are onboard but when he vehemently argues that he doesnt do either when it is obvious that he does I find that rather annoying. If youre going to fudge rolls and railroad because you want to keep things interesting then at least fez up about it. ,rpg,cu1nh28,3,t5_2qh2s

Speaking of goal each character has a list of goals called fates that constantly adds or drops as the story goes on and the character grows.Most of the gameplay is base on roleplaying with dice only being used to settle conflicts.

4882091,0,t3_3hr8px,In terms of plot Id suggest taking a leaf from Firefly. A major theme in the lore at least is that the crew is barely scraping bythe constant need for food parts and fuel turns their life into a daily grind. Ultimately this forces the crew to start taking disreputable work because more legitimate stuff simply isnt available.In your setting taking this anything goes approach might make things a little more interesting. Giving the players little quests to do rather than just go pick peaches etc. would help to keep things interestingespecially if you emphasize that their ship is going to fall apart if they dont make it back with the cash. So lets say theyre hired as day laborers on a spaceshipand the supervisor screws them out of their wages. What are they going to do? Being migrant workers they dont have much legal recourse if they get violent theyll likely get arrested and if they come back empty handed its exceptionally likely that theyll freeze to death in the deep of space out of fuel or worse. I think this could be a really great setting! In terms of system Id be tempted to say Savage Worldsits simple and flexible enough to make it work I would think. I would not reccomend the Firefly RPG thoughdespite the vague similarity between the settings the Firefly RPG is built more around drama and excitement than the relentless grind that it sounds like youre going for.Good luck!,rpg,cu9xbpe,7,t5_2qh2s

First of all the rules were very open but the setting was very closed. In the original version the game was about French politics and how nothing is as it seems and everything changes. In the American version the setting never changes and everything is exactly as it seems. I think that there was some kind of obscure Redguard style purity movement within the innominate community at the developer level that was frankly completely uninteresting to me.

Theres a win but its not the win.Or Call of Cthulhu in scenarios where you actually get to the end maybe you get to kill a Shoggoth. Maybe you even get to destroy an avatar of Nyarlathotep. Youll be dead andor insane afterwards but the point was less about getting out of alive so much as blowing up that indescribable evil that was going to destroy the world.

5004936,0,t3_3jhbi7, Oh! Ive got a few. I am a history undergrad shopping around fror grad schools within the next year so my bookshelf is full of history books. Im just giving you the sources for the shitting in buckets era as my friend would call it but i have many many more. The least dry one and imho the most like what you are looking for is the time travellers guide to medieval england. Informative and full of the minute details about daily life explained for modern viewpoints. Other good ones ive used are medieval history nd ed by norman cantor the crusadss by henry treece a short history of reniassance and reformation europe by jonathan zophy stephensons medieval feudalism george henderson early medieval its about the art and how that reflects the culture of the period from roughly   also good are primary sources such as those from fulcher of chartes first crusade historian or the codices that show the german school of fencing pictures that show armored knights how to fight with lots of weapons if you google fechtbcher you should find some. There are a few open source ones like the ones here I like to add in to the academic mix with the myths and legends of the day like la morte darthur beowulf the saga of burnt njal the song of roland and canturbury tales preferably in modern english for readability. If you google historical bardic tales or minstrel songs you should find a lot of dorks like me that have compiled known ones. For historical fiction you cant beat bernard cornwell since his is as historically accurate as fiction allows as well as conn igguldens mongol series. I also suggest looking at raskhistorians and using the searchfaq functions to find sourced and accurate answers to questions you may have like how archers worked or how knights trained. Finally for pictographic histories with lots of good info to inspire you should check out the warrior battle and battle at sea books by R.G. Grant. They are not suuuuper dense but they have a lot of good information and they are what id call entry level. Solid shout out to hardcore history. Been a fan since i started my undergrad and i have managed to work my way through his entire backlog.In the end it depends on how historically hard you want to make it but these books will have lots of info that you can draw on. I also have a lot of sources i use for modern era s tech and on type games and there are a few here that overlap. Happy gaming! ,rpg,cupa6z2,6,t5_2qh2s

But remember not every moment of the game needs to be an epic adventure.Sometimes space is just space amp theres not a thing wrong with a simple flight from one end of the system to the other being nothing more than an accelerated scene.Except in combat assured situations where I have set up something I personally dont use encounters in space the sky or water.

So not only do they not have any magic whatsoever they can negate magic over time.  For a race of shortlived savages that dominate the natural world the permanence of a magic enchantment is nothing.  Given time their very nature will demagicify anything.You could even extend it to require prolonged physical contact.  That way humans dont just remove magic traps in an area by being there. And even humans living in an area wont remove an area enchantment for centuries.  But eventually they will disenchant an area.

5015504,0,t1_cuqjkaf,Sure. But the question is  is Performance going to be as important a skill as Athletics or Intimidate or Perception? Is it going to be rolled roughly as often? More importantly is it going to matter to the story equally as much?  If not then it can either be OK thats just Diplomacy with your song or OK make a straight charisma check.  If you make it its own skill then one of the following can happen   . The player wants to be someone good at music as a character. They see its a skill on the sheet so therefore they must put points into that skill or else their character is not good at music. However if the GM then puts no or few challenges or features in the game that use that skill the skill points are effectively wasted.  . As above but the GM sees the points in Music and goes OK well that means I better put some musical challenges in the game along the way so that this player feels good about having picked that skill.  That works and in a general sense is encouraged behaviour in GMs but it might mean splitting out one skill into two. It also necessarily means knocking other characters out of that niche so they know in advance.  Whereas before all characters might have been able to use music for a Diplomacy check if they feel its both incharacter and dramatically appropriate e.g. no Why of course my rough mountain barbarian can play the harp amazingly now its barred off to characters who it might fit for Play the harp to impress the maiden? Well Dave the Barbarian put skill points into Perform but you Marty the foppish rogue? You only put points into Diplomacy and Bluff. You cant play the harp that wouldnt be fair to Dave.  ,rpg,cuqk3yg,1,t5_2qh2s

5051362,1,t3_3k52sn,I love the concept of Numenera. Not being able to tell science from magic. Giving players a bunch of one use over powered items. Crazy ass monsters.However in play...it is not that great. By the time players hit Tier  their power starts to get crazy. I had one player that could just not be hit with speed attacks...like ever. He had so much speed edge and pool as well as skills that something would have to be Level  to even get attempt to hit him.I had another player that took the crafts illusions option. It was ok at Tier  got a bit wacky at Tier  and then just bullshit crazy at Tier  that I had no idea how to deal with it.Something that compounds this is the way EXP is used. You get EXP through GM interventions as a bribe to let the GM fuck with you. You can spend the EXP to refuse the intervention or get EXP for taking it. Some players tend to horde EXP and accept every single intervention so you have cases where one player is barely Tier  with  advances and another player that is Tier .,rpg,cuuvpn3,1,t5_2qh2s

5086999,0,t1_cuybteo,gt One last idea a subscription based program that allows users to simultaneously produce content and consume content however they wish within parameters. Maybe only premium users would be able to upload content. Say average Joe pays  a month to download a certain number of books and view any number for free then Author Joe pays  a month to publish works and he gets a kickback whenever someone downloads it. Based on the number of views something has it gets moved to suggested downloads for members and advertised as popular content. Before you ask no no I have not thought about this idea to the point of balancing it yet. hahaOne thing that has been drummed into my head for years  anyplace that takes my money for publishing my material isnt a good idea. At best it is a vanity press and at worst  a scam. If I self publish I do have to pay all the fees do all the marketing and more but I hold all the rights and any money in this case probably very little goes to me and not to the publisher.If I have my writing bought by someone it means that they hold someall of the rights but I get an agreed upon payment. It might be a work for hire and Im paid once or I may get royalties  but Im paid for the work. The idea that Im paying  or more for a chance to get paid... thats not something that I could support. And even if I dont care about getting paid  I can still put out a game into the world for less than  a month. It might be a blog putting something up someplace for free or nearly so.Im inherently skeptical of a subscription model. Im old school in that way I want to pay once and be done.

Its not all like . but I loathe that system so in my opinion thats a really good thing. Dice pools allow for a nice bell curve of probability which is a bit more predictable. The problem lies in the glitch system  the more dice you have the more likely you are to have a disastrous failure if you fail. One thing Id stress is dont try to implement everything at once. This doesnt mean house rule the game Id just ban the more complex systems like rigging for your first few sessions and ignore some of the modifier tables for a while. Of course communicate this to you players and dont allow them to abuse it. Much like burning wheel its much easier to gradually implement the complexity rather than front loading all of it.

Despite this it may be hard for some players to come out of their shell in an online environment. It is much easier to be in character when youre doing meatspace gaming and as a DM its easier to read who is bored and who might want a bit of focus on their character.

5225188,0,t3_3mhpy1,I posted earlier about how I prefer when a DM doesnt intervene and I just remembered a story where I wish he had. uscrollbreakWe were in a long campaign searching for the five gems of maguffin to kill the BBEG. Each gem was small and smooth and was rumoured that if you swallowed it you received the power of the gem at a price. We had finally found one after a dozen sessions and coming very close to TPK. Tired and low in HP our fighter was the first to pick up the gem. He stood there looking at it wondering whether or not to swallow it. Was the potential price too scary to risk the potential powers it would grant?While he was debating the rogue grabbed it out of his hand and swallowed it. The fighter saidWTF man!Rogue Im an impulsive rogue. Its how Ive always been.Fighter I fast draw my knife cut his throat reach down his neck and pull the gem out of his intestines.The DM kinda just gaped at him and the whole party started shouting at the fighter. Really quickly we disbanded half of us wanted to get as far away from the fighter as possible the other half wanted to kill him and one other person didnt care. It happened so fast that our DM was caught off guard and the session just sort of ended. We never finished that campaign.In retrospect I wish the DM had called for an initiative roll and not allowed a coup de grace on a PC who was facing another PC that he had just robbed. That said I would have enjoyed the initiative roll for everyone involved. I would have liked to pull them apart and talk it out. I would not have wanted the DM to say no PVP. I would not want the session to continue and have one or both of them not invited back. I can understand casual games where you just wanna have a good time on an adventure but I care about the narrative too. The best teams fight. Sometimes it gets out of hand. Luke and Han the XMen Harry and Ron Sam and Frodo... Inter party drama is a cool dynamic if you can appreciate it and not get too stressed out by it.

Included was a sealed letter addressed to the guys wife a picture of him and her together on their wedding day with their names and date on the back and a goldplated pocket watch engraved with initials.This would be largely useless to the group but the sense of importance could guide them in finding a way to deliver the letter and picture which gives you a simple hook as a storyteller.

With a teleporting pirate island and an ancient civilization with superior technology waiting to be unearthed. And magic users that are prejudiced against and hunted down. And the titular  skies are basically seasons that rotate around a central vortex of flame. The seasons include Thunder Frost Mist Rocks  . . . Ghosts  . . . Jungle . . .Our games have added a number of things to the setting. Like for example one of the two moons is inhabited by samurai who live in ice pagodas and ride between them on roman chariots drawn by white tigers. That most of the ruins left by said ancient civilisation are actually theme parks which is why theres so many crystal horns about. Secret societies that try to rule the world by controlling secret magical gifts like the gift of the goldbug that lets you see business connections as though they were tangible. A very talented goldbug can see the golden lines connecting people to their various title deeds cash and goods as well. Secret societies that bet on world events patronized by the world elite . . . who can definitely do some market manipulation or insider trading if you catch the drift. Entire cities that are shunned by the rest of the world for not outcasting some of their magic users.

5487999,0,t3_3q90re,Deadlands Deadlands Deadlands.The Hell on Earth story line of the game projects a possible future reality from the original Deadlands where the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse managed to get all of mankind to finally destroy the world and terraform it with fear. Each of the factions is pretty interesting and the focus is on how evil develops and the choices people make rather than evil for evils sake. The game is also quite broad so you can struggle for survival defend against a mutant invasion or fight to survive against an almost unkillable monster made of fear. All of this is set against the backdrop of a supernatural atomic war as people try and survive and rebuild amidst the chaos.They rules for the Classic nonReloadedSavage Worlds line drip with flavour. The game plays on the Apocalypse Western trope and you play with poker chips that let you up the ante on your rolls in hope of a better result or ride out damage youve taken. Certain character types from the original Weird West game as still around so you can still be a poker playing wizard who battles demons for power or you can play a trained military psychic with a more strained and reliable albeit weaker set of powers. But normals are just as valid and capable as those with strange magical if not a little better. Just because you can shoot radiation from your hands doesnt mean a shotgun cant be just as effective.I like Deadlands more than a lot of other postapocalypse games because you can take it in a lot of different directions.

Theres thousands of monsters to choose from and you can populate your world with any CR level you want.  Whats challenging is creating an encounter that is FUN.  Making sure everyone at the table is having fun including yourself is the most important job of the GM.In the spirit of this most encounters I design try to incorporate something for everyone.  If I know one of my PCs is highly specialized at throwing fireballs around I give him enemies that are clumped together and out of reach for the fighter.  If I have a PC that is specialized at climbing I make a timed encounter where they have to go retrieve some artifact from the cliff face while the party holds off the baddies.  If your barbarian has gone down the entire cleavegreat cleave tree or the spring attackwhirlwind tree why not give him endless hordes of kobolds to cut in half?Its true that my campaigns tend to lean towards the easy side with  of fights being easy if handled intelligently and  being moderate to hard if handled correctly but thats what I and my players want. ,rpg,cwhpb0u,2,t5_2qh2s

5588526,0,t1_cwpprol,Well it depends.  Icons are major influential figures in a setting right?  So theyre probably going to have influence outside of those results.  For example Keith Baker put a sample list of Icons for a Sharnbased Eberron game on his blog.  The list is basically some of the major power groups of Sharn and the party will almost certainly interact with many of them in any Sharn game regardless of any mechanical considerations.  I will note that when I ran th Age in Eberron I actually stripped out Icon mechanics entirely and didnt find the game any worse for it.If youre going to use Icons in a setting like Eberron where there are many powerful influential people and groups around Id use them to help narrow down the focus of the game.  The Icons you choose should be the peoplegroups whose influence you most want to see on the game.  Maybe even instead of picking a set of Icons beforehand let your players choose relationships with some of the peoplegroups in the setting and make those plus a few others you think would be good to include your formal Icons.  This plays into story guide rolls well which is something I didnt really notice as being a thing until reading the Eyes of the Stone Thief adventure  in various places that adventure gives instructions to the effect of Thing relates to the plans of one of the Icons  roll for story guide results to pick which.  I think if youre using Icons thats a convenient mechanic for generating connections between stuff the players find while keeping the game focused on the power groups you want it to relate to.,rpg,cwpt4ls,1,t5_2qh2s

Although if you disregard the second part about the boss fight with weaknesses you do have some systems where a shield is more meaningful mechanically than just a bonus to your AC.

I mean cmon it takes decades to map out everything on a SINGLE planet and youll have access to many many more to put adventures on.  Then of course you can add unmapped asteroids moons  comets space stations other ships pirates etc.In the end all you really need to do is write some basic stats for each planetEarth   water.  Seven landmasses.  Mostly humans some demihumans.Mars  No water.  Rocky land.  Two races Roundheads and Locals.  Roundheads are actually young Locals.Jupiter  Gas giant.  No land except for a giant diamond at its core.  Jellyfish like organisms.Pluto  Lifeless....or is it?Lastly do what I do for pretty much any game I run  Have three or four adventures ready to go at all times.  And instead of placing them at a concrete position on YOUR map watch where the players go then pick the adventure that works best where they stop of THEIR map.  Then add it to your map in case they need to go backThey flew to a rocky planet?  Use the cave adventure.They flew to an inhabited world?

5701255,0,t3_3t3egn,System wise requiem by a mile world wise I lean towards the original. Alot of the conflict for the masquerade was a fight between the character and the society they suddenly found themselves in. Not only were they being forced to swim in the same pond as creatures with hundreds of years of experience on them like some horrible ponzi scheme they would always be inferior to those that came before them.With the whole blood potency cycling thing and the lack of a society as a whole a lot of the gas got taken out of this particular trope. They also made vampire society harder with the concept that vampires are catish towards eachother likely to frenzy when meeting another vampire unexpectedly. Your mileage may vary though.,rpg,cx3snxa,1,t5_2qh2s
5704491,0,t1_cx413uj,A boilerplate example from the books is a case where a character is skilled at climbing. The character attempts to climb a cliff which is not very difficult. In Numenera this can mean it makes it easy enough that you dont have to roll at all you just succeed.As a GM Intrusion the GM could say Actually as youre climbing up the cliffside starts to break apart you will actually have to roll to see if you succeed.If the player agrees the player gets  XP for the Intrusion. They keep one and give the second XP to a different player. Then theyd roll for their climbing check.If the player refuses they could say I spot the crumbling areas as I approach them and I climb around them. The player then gives up  XP for refusing the GM Intrusion.,rpg,cx474qc,1,t5_2qh2s

If a character has a score of  or  in Honestdeceitful or TrustingSuspicious he should at least roll to see if his character wants to know what the other guy read let alone steal. Otherwise Id just let them have at it.If the player who has the books in his possession thwarts the theft add negative modifier to the other guys attempts to steal it provided the other player takes additional steps to make sure no one steals the books. If the player fails to steal them during a prolonged period of time add a restriction that he may attempt to steal them once per session for example.Hope it helped!,rpg,cx8g5c9,1,t5_2qh2s

At best you will generally lose sanity for casting them as youre messing with the source code of reality in horribly bad ways.Summoning and Binding are also often separate. Summoning the horrible monster is one thing making it do something useful is quite another. Trail is one of the more interesting variants as it tries to fix some concerns with CoC Mainly that the basic rules dont handle investigation particularly well. It is Not Fun if an RPG campaign essentially halts because the PCs cant find a crucial clue. On the other hand it is also not fun if the PCs skills and actions dont matter and theyre railroaded to the next scene. Trail tries to fix this although I dont well enough to comment on how successful it is I believe it uses a clue point resource that is expended to make sure key clues are discovered.

The game system can be a bit overwhelming at first because the rulebook is dense and they dont have great presentation in the books but the core mechanics are pretty simple and its certainly a game where it can be as simplecomplicated as your GM wants to make it. If your GM is into it theres generators in the rulebooks for creating star systems that go as far as describe the planets water content governments laws notable moons contraband goods etc. Theres several pages dedicated to tables to design alien species  not intelligent humanoid species  theres pages devoted to designing the freakin random animals that populate each planet. Or you could just absolutely ignore all that and make stuff up on the fly with no real drawbacks too. It works equally well for a TNG explore and science the whole universe and get mixed up in their politics game as well as a Star WarsMass Effect planet hopping space opera.My fave part of the system is the random space encounters though as well as a supplementary book that gives like over  generated NPCs including smugglers pirates religious zealots passengers wanting transportation etc etc all of whom are great at being a whole adventure seed in themselves.,rpg,cy0c7sg,7,t5_2qh2s

If theres no explicitly defined skill for it the character isnt completely unskilled at A Thing untilunless you say they are. If its NOT on your character sheet there a dozen different ways you can justify the character being able to try doing That Thing anyway using This Other Number as a basis instead.. A Fighter being unable to open a lock is only valuable if theres also a Rogue in the party. Theres no need for Thief niche protection if theres no Thief player to get annoyed at you for muscling in on their territory.. Skills can be defined as if theres something at stake. Yes itd be implausible for a person whos never picked a lock before to try and do it within the next  seconds but if he has time to try and if he has some nebulous connection to having some marginal skill at it see  he could maybe figure it out right?

They got her into an ambulance and were rushing her to a major hospital when the party member responsible started hacking into traffic lights to congest traffic. The rest of the party proceeded to get her stretcher out of the ambulance run several blocks on foot and then hijack a truck. At this point the other player asks me in a private message how that entire exchange had been done over if he could shut down the power at the closest hospital. I told him it would be a long shot and there would be back up generators even if he accomplished it but because he had a high computers skill Id give him a shot and on a nat  on d hed have it. I swore audibly into the skype call when he made the roll. So they got there to the chaotic scene of the hospital employees evacuating all noncritical patients. The NPC lived and it wasnt until that PC died in a horrific crash a few sessions later that they found out he caused everything.Worst moment A meta one. I started a dungeondiving campaign on roll with randoms which died after a halfdozen sessions because I was already totally burned out.

6114810,0,t3_3z97h7,Car Wars is still one of my favorite games of all time.  I have fond memories of my gaming group from the era when it was big.  x scale is about right for Hot Wheels cars.  It means the arenas are now x larger too but pushing a hot wheels car thats been modified with armor plates turrets and guns is a hoot.   You can really benefit from a magnetic whiteboard and easel to track turns and speeds such that all players can see when running at a larger scale.From an RPG standpoint Autoduel Quarterly was a quarterly publication from Steve Jackson Games back when Car Wars was big.  Issue  had rules for corporations which provided an interesting campaign setting. Players then ran companies instead of individuals and theres actually some room for roleplay there.Within corporations drivers and gunners could rise to prominence and give you room to play a the pedestrian level.  The downside is that theres really not much room for conflict resolution that isnt at the end of a gun since theres effectively no noncombat skills.Car Wars also had rules for Chassis amp Crossbow.  Think Mad Max level car battles. There are also rules lurking about to wedge the car wars system into Champions HERO system if youre keen.In the end car building and theorycrafting is easily the most time consuming aspect of the game.  And this is even taking into account that  ingame seconds often takes about  hours of real world time.  If people just want to push cars around and roll dice build one car that they all run with two or three variants.  ,rpg,cykovp5,4,t5_2qh2s

They have an awesome character generator So the idea is to make  level  characters and then level up after the first encounter death or session.Now this DM we will call him claytonian because that is his reddit name decided that XP was not a thing and role play didnt mean anything. We were saddled with level  characters with no equipment and we didnt know where any towns were. The only way to level up was through having a montage  Fine with me but then the DM proceeded to never give out loot.  This went on for weeks.One session we spent hours at a cave entrance because nobody could figure out how to make a torch. Nothing worked. Making a fire at the cave entrance also didnt drive anything out. The smoke just blew away no matter what we did. In another session we were stuck in a house and the railroaded fight took the whole session. Of course no loot so zero chance of advancement.All in all we were stuck with zero level characters the entire campaign as the occasional guy to gather enough loot to make it to level  was instakilled.Not fun.,rpg,cynqijc,7,t5_2qh2s
6144808,0,t3_3zm5l5,I had one player who would occasionally GM and he was much harder on the players team than I ever was. I played for the story more than the rules whereas he was a stickler for the dice roll. The dice roll result was set in stone no fudging for narrative effect allowed.So in one session his character had gotten into a fight they could have easily handled. But the Dice Gods werent with him and try as I might to bend the rules to help save his character one hed built up over a good year of play it wasnt going to happen. His character died in heroic fashion but it was a real hard loss for everyone playing. The character death became a legendary part of our universes lore and the repercussions where felt in subsequent adventures. I felt that Id let him down as the GM but we parted ways after some calm words and he seemed fine. Hed also agreed to GM the next session.The next session came around and it became pretty obvious that he was out to kill off my long standing characters I used to run two characters at a time. The session became tense and unpleasant I vaguely recall one of the other players calling him out on it during a break but my characters survived just!! This became the status quo whenever he GMd. Eventually he got his revenge and killed off my characters in a session later on but the way they went out in a hail of fire was a story in itself.I was quickly asked by the rest of the group to resume GM duties and I pretty much ran every session there after. I refused to take subsequent revenge on his new characters but that one event hung over all subsequent sessions until we finally parted ways in real life.,rpg,cyo3m18,1,t5_2qh2s

6160548,0,t3_3zv5qr,Let me offer some tangible advice since most other things seem to have been covered. In the beginning dont stress prepping too much. Get some base cliffnotes and maybe stat a few NPCs. Save all your work so you can reference and perhaps reuse ideas areas people etc. as templates for future games. Youd be surprised how little prep is needed for a  hour session and once youve built up a swiss army library of things to pull from you can pretty much roll up games on the spot.When creating things such as NPCs areas items etc. Keep in mind to add a little flair to them. Dont just make a troll. Make it a troll thats missing an eye and drips slimy drool on the cavern floor. Atmosphere is everything. Stimulate the senses. I keep a postit note above my GM screens that say Taste sight touch smell hearAlso try out both battlemaps and theater of the mind. Especially if you have a consistent group. Each has their pros and cons and will make you all better tabletop gamers as a whole.Speaking of group. Find out the kind of game that your players want to play. Theres a big difference between Dungeons and Dragons and Burning Wheel. Neither is innately superior to the other but both do what they do well.Have fun. Dont just focus on your players but you should be enjoying the game as well. This is very important because a lot of GMs will feel as if their games are a second job.,rpg,cypw2xu,2,t5_2qh2s

Unfortunately this is the most common dysfunction of GMs. The advice to run is plausible but depends on how invested you are with this group and would like to attempt to change whats going on. Try talking to the gm and letting him know that you have noticed that what the characters do isnt having much influence on the game and you would like that to change. If hes unwilling or unable to listen and change then leaving becomes more of an option. If he does want to change its going to be a slow process so consider that too.Should you want to change groups Id suggest finding an indie games group they tend to be more about free form storytelling and playing to see what happens.  You may be well suited for Fiasco microscope or one of the other narrative style games and the groups that play them.As far as the subject of rape in game yes it comes up quite a bit. yes you should talk to the GM and let them know that you are uncomfortable with the subject.

6347814,0,t3_42l799,First of all good luck!  Ive been trying to get that Revelation Space feel for a while now and Im finding that its really hard to translate what makes the books so good into an RPG without ending up with something that feels less gritty.For systems my group has tried both ends of the mechanics vs. narrative spectrum.  For highcrunch Eclipse Phase is a decent system.  The default setting is highly posthuman so theres a mechanic for almost anything that could conceivably happen in the RS setting.  Making a character doesnt quite require an accounting degree but its very fiddly and has lots of tweakable knobs and flippable switches if your group is into that.Nova Praxis was the next system we tried and the one were currently using.  Its based on Fate so its far more narratively driven than Eclipse Phase.  The default setting is more transhuman than posthuman so arguably requires less hatchetwork to get to the Revelation Space feel.  It does require your players to have a better grasp of the setting tropes though because its SO loose and openended that you can run off the rails pretty quickly otherwise.In the end we ditched the whole RS setting and decided to focus on the solar system in the nearish future.  We figured out that for this group its more fun to explore how humanity develops and what role the characters play in that than to jump into an already established galaxy.If you find a different system and it works well for you please let me know!  Were always in search of the perfect set of rules to enable our game and then get out of the way. ,rpg,czb6bzx,3,t5_2qh2s

When you use Extra Effort youre saying that power use is really important. The actions leading up to it are a little less important to you and the ones following it are a lot less important. In Dungeon World you decide whats important within a single move. Youll end up with a lot of partial successes where you get to choose which result of your actions is most important. For example a partial success on a standard ranged attack does damage but requires you to choose one of the following You end up in a dangerous spot while you line up the shot You couldnt find a great shot and do reduced damage You spray wildly doing normal damage but losing ammunition.I like this approach. It adds color and texture to every move you make and pushes you in directions that you didnt expect to go. I definitely encourage the OP to give it a try.,rpg,czds8q0,2,t5_2qh2s

A successful persuade roll can make a character more sympathetic or convince an NPC of something they had already considered but it isnt absolute. A character subject to a high persuade roll doesnt have to be happy about it it can be a begrudging acceptance that you may be right.Essentially persuade should always give the players some advantage but it should never be treated as if they have control over the characters actions. ,rpg,czg5j78,52,t5_2qh2s

6402653,0,t3_4396v0,Have you heard of Epic by Conor Kostick?  Its set in a world that has eliminated violence by solving all conflicts through a world spanning MMORPG that everyone plays. Entrance into universities is done by testing your character etc.  The political elite in the large cities can basically do what they want cause whenever complaints are raised against them their characters beat the poor peasant people in the arena.  I believe its implied they have certain restricted character classes but certainly they have the resources they need to stay ahead of everyone. The story picks up with a kid in a poor rural area whos lost a lot of characters studying the AI behaviour of a dragon in the game killing a dragon is a huge deal His character dies during this study just before university exams and figuring what the hell he makes a mostly charisma character which is usually considered a massive dump stat. He begins to have meaningful interactions with NPCs that are pretty well unprecedented because everyone elses character is a collection of ugly grey pologons with their low charisma and basically that starts him on his adventure. Its a YA reading level so its not incredibly complex but I thought it was a really enjoyable story when I last read it and thought the idea of using the game as a proxy for politics and conflict was really neat. It is about video games albeit crpgs but I would argue its basically the theorized version of if computers could run games as open ended as tabletop rpgs because the npcs really seem to have minds of their own and the world is alive in a lot of ways so I feel it still fits.

6488237,0,t3_44hsau,The setting is fantastic. It can be intimidating but has often been said to contain more plot hooks per square inch than any other RPG which is impressive given the volume and size of supplements that have been released. As in all things RPG everything is optional and if you dont like something Im not a fan of Meat Hab and Neopigs personally you can easily modify or exclude them. The most important thing that can be said for the setting though is the more time the GM and players invest in it the more theyll get out of the game. The Eclipse Phase setting works great when painted with broad strokes but works best when the players can make a distinction between Venusian habitats aligned with the Morningstar Constellation and the Planetary Consortium for example.Character creation is a beast if using the point buy system in the core rulebook. Many will suffer from option paralysis others will get stuck on what to do with those last few points. I recommend using the package buy system found in Transhuman to overcome much of those hurdles.One of the things that bugged me was that  points in a skill is considered PhD knowledge of a subject. But as I continued reading I realized things like complimentary skills equipment and methods to reduce the difficulty of the task can easily push that  to . This is so common I almost think the system isnt meant to be played strictly RAW players should have a good idea of their buffs and the GM adjudicates any difficulty modifiers in a lackadaisical manner      based on what feels right.,rpg,czqfk9a,3,t5_2qh2s

You cant get away with an incredibly crunchy system that is bad. Basically any physical traits are worthless if you want to take advantage of the transhumanism morph exchange. So Chargen has a ridiculous beginner trap of making a tough character. The second side of this flaw?  No one can build a fighter. It is only hackers stealth and psychics.

6594949,0,t3_45z4t5,Dont be ridiculous. There are no robots named Jeff.I think you swung a bit too far in the other direction while trying to make the opposite of a DMPC. It sounds like its working for you though and I cant blame you at all because the first thing people hear when they start exploring the greater RPG community isgt Never introduce a DMPCAnd its terrible advice. And not because it isnt true but because its meaningless. Theres no definition of a DMPC that clearly explains when youve stopped having a good NPC and started having a showstealer. Instead I think we should give advice on how to make good nonplayer charactersMake compelling characters... The DM only interacts with the players through characters theyre the only tool you have to shape your game and make it interesting. The DM should always be trying to make an interesting world thats fun to interact with. So you always want to try to make characters that are interesting to interact with so players can have interesting interactions with your world.Its crazy to try to make boring characters just so your players shine brighter in comparison because youre really just taking away the kindling for cool player interactions. Characters are the tools both players and the DM use to build the story....That are important because of the party. Yoda is important because he trained Luke a PC. Luke never would have been able to defeat Darth Vader without his help but no one considers him the hero of the story. Let important characters exist but make that a function of how they support your players. You do this by making a character important because of who the players are they need to service the players story. This is where I think your rule  goes too far.Never use an NPC when a player will suffice. This is probably the biggest takehome message I want to convey here. Remember that the reason were creating compelling characters is because thats how the players interact with the world. If an action could be taken by a player let a player do it! NPCs doing great and amazing things irrespective of the players should be relegated to flavor text. You can have hundreds of pages of lore about a particular elf in your binder but until the players start digging up his garden the fact that his petunias have won the trikingdom botanists seal of excellence three years running is entirely immaterial. Nothing in the world matters until it matters to the players. Let players solve their own problems. Leave room for the players to generate problem solving tools. Your robot hampers this somewhat because instead of players having an infinite breadth of tools available bound by their imagination they can limit themselves to What can we make Jeffbot do that will solve our current situation?This tends to become an issue when important characters arent functions of who the players are. A riggers drone in shadowrun is a function of who that player is. The player feels good using their drone because its something they invested in and obtained because of who they made their character.

6612445,0,t3_468sfl,So I agree with the people who say that you need to have this option come up before they get to the encounter.  A lot of players almost always default to violence if they dont have some other solution presented to them.  Id say a simple way to present the possibility would be to just have an NPC ask them to cleanse the tree guy instead of killing him perhaps explaining why it would be a good idea.  This is too straightforward for a lot of people I know but I like approaches like this because it guarantees that the players will at least realize that theres an option besides combat to resolve the issue.

6649291,0,t3_46pz93,Sounds to me like its potentially time to roll up new characters and play as a salvage operation that stumbles upon a derelict shuttle with  apparently dead bodies inside. Whether or not they actually are would be determined by how creative a solution you could come up with to the issue of survival since it sounds like you do have a number of options. After that everyone could then have a chance to either use their old character again and continue as before or switch to the new character from the salvage crew and youd either wind up just continuing as before but with an interesting interlude getting another perspective on things and effectively launching another campaign arc or the same one with different characters if the new ones effectively inherit the mission by way of discovering information in the shuttle or having a hybrid party which now has a bunch of fun new character interactions to work out in addition to what they were trying to do before.

6659407,0,t3_46tuuq,My dream campaign is actually  campaigns but logistically I just dont think its ever going to happen.Basically I would like to run the same campaign for two groups of players at the same time in two slightly different settings. Same set up same villains in fact literally the same villains because theyve found a way to jump between universes using an ancient and unstable Gate.However using the Gate is starting to bring the two worlds closer together. At first this manifests through strange coincidences. Odd unexplainable moments when events in one reality effect things in the other. A fight that causes a fire in one reality causes the same building to mysteriously burn down in the other for example.Eventually the PCs in both campaigns find the bag a Bag of Holding where one extradimensional space has openings in two different realities. At first the players will notice nothing but over time theyll probably realize that their gold totals keep changing or that they have more rations than they expected. Sooner or later one party will put something valuable in the bag which the other party steals or conversely discovers items manifesting in the bag they didnt put in there. Over time they put two and two together perhaps start passing notes through the bag.As the campaign goes on the worlds approach close enough that things start spontaneously making the jump people animals entire buildings. The two groups of PCs finally meet up maybe trade a couple of members. They work together to save both universes before they collide and destroy each other.Its Crisis on Multiple Earths the DampD campaign.Unfortunately it would require a mountain of planning time plus heavily invested players and Ive never been sure how to actually run it.Ive got a couple of other aces up my sleeve though that I may get to sometime.

When you still have the ability to get better there is little reason to hoard them.Also note that the fate pot is limited in size. I played in a game where every blue chip was accounted for before anyone drew.

Suddenly if I want to be able to tie a guy up in his belt which I pulled off last round to distract him by making his pants drop I need to be an th level martial character specialized in that fighting style. As soon as you have an option that allows characters to do something that implies that no one without that option can do it.edit I totally agree with your point that the GM can allow for creativity and fun in any system. But there are some systems that encourage it and others that restrict it.

6856565,0,t3_49lmuh,Way back in the s I was in a Call of Cthulhu game that basically played out this idea. Set on a research submarine descending into the trench the scenario was titled Grace Under Pressure and was printed in the CoC magazine The Unspeakable Oath.  It was a very wellwritten module perfect for a oneoff with plenty of tension and lots of detail about the deep sea environment pressure both literal and figurative isolation the fear of decompression from a toorapid ascent keeping them trapped in the deep.One of its gimmicks was handled brilliantly by our GM.   At one point the party is expected to split with a small away team taking a separate remote submersible to explore away from the main submarine.   Rather than do the typical rpg thing of running a subset of the game while everyone else is a spectator or just going in the other room for a secret conference we actually ran the two separate parties simultaneously.  The GM had an assistant take the two players who were members of the away team I was one into a closet which had been emptied of everything except for  milk crates to sit on.  We were cramped into the tiny space mimicking a bathysphere claustrophobic and with no communication with the rest of the party except for a twoway radio. They gave each team a walkietalkie to check in with each other.  The away team explored the crevasse while the main group made repairs to the damaged main submarine.  When the uncomfortable claustrophobic explorers discovered the strange sights in the deep their only means of getting the message back to the main party was by crackly radio... which of course the GM had rigged for interference.  He surreptitiously used a third radio to squelch our signal so that when we tried to communicate it was broken and cutting in and out and occasionally would crackle with strange sounds neither party had sent.,rpg,d0ti0ls,1,t5_2qh2s

6919772,0,t1_d107nt1,a review from Jason Walters of Indie Press Revolution and Steve Long of HERO gamesHere are Steves thoughts as well as a few of mine. Forwarded message From ltSteve......Date Fri Nov   at  PMSubject UbantuTo xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx    I spent a little time this afternoon briefly looking over Ubantu. General thoughts in no particular order by my count its a bit shy of  words or roughly half the length of the Champions Beyond manuscript. So by itself itd probably be an approx.  page book. However besides reorganizing what exists theres a lot left to cover just based on the authors notes never mind my own thoughts about what needs to be added. For example there are no NPCs villains or monsters well there are some monster descriptions but not character sheets. he writes reasonably well so it would require less textual editing than many books Hero published under my editorship  but by no means no editing. the names got to be changed. Ubantu is too close to Ubuntu the wellknown opensource operating system. Even adding a single syllable  for example Urubantu  would probably do it. I agree. Linux Ubuntu is something like the fifth most popular operating system in the world. preparing the art list for this will probably be several days work in and of itself. If the author cant provide extensive art references and notes to work from it will take even longer. The enormity of this task alone makes me disinclined to want to get involved with the project. So the art list will be your responsibility tantric. Ill walk you through it when the time comes.the author definitely seems to know his stuff and to put in a lot of research time  unless hes really good at making stuff up. The book needs an extensive bibliography and the editordeveloper needs to get it from the author before any work on the project is done so the authors work can be checked. Another tedious thankless task  at least until enough checkings been done to convince us that this guys not full of BS.Its a fair observation tantric. Well have to selectively double check a bit of your work.  I definitely find this to be an intriguing setting unlike any other Ive seen for gaming. Thats not necessarily a strong point though  theres a reason the gaming store shelves arent filled with clones of Tekumel and Jorune. I suspect this is too far off the beaten path to interest most gamers unless its priced mighty cheaply. Id guess youre looking at a minimum of  months work for an editor more if it turns out that a lot of additional writing is necessary the authors hard to work with the editors not adept at using the HERO System or the elephant spirits take offense at the endeavor.,rpg,d10ohav,1,t5_2qh2s

Play as a Neutral fighter  not Neutral in the DampD PC cosmology sense where you believe things should remain in balance but Neutral in the undead servant sense.

6992237,0,t3_4bek4b,I apologize in advance for answering a question you didnt answer but this is a design paradigm that bothers me. And I would like to make an argument for why the norm is the norm.A potential and common pitfall when suggestingwriting many methods of conflict resolution is what happens when one character wants to fight with his sword and another attacks the same target mentally? Do the actions of the melee become fornaught as soon as the mental attacks immobilize the foe? Part of the reason that hp totals are so ubiquitous is not just for ease of bookkeeping but because it lets everyone contribute together. Maybe take a look at systems like numenera and fate core which divide attacks into  and  health pools respectively. Even if the methods of conflict resolution attack them differently via grappling or direct mental attacks or by being really spooky they allow the entire party to work together.When you have two characters who can only resolve conflicts via different methods or who prefer to you run the risk of dividing your party. Some groups flourish with this and have just as much fun taking extended turns in the spotlight but others wont.Finally it makes balancing conflict a nightmare. All of a sudden monsters need a billion notes in their statblocks about all the different defensespreferred methods of attack. Every method of attack a player can use should be open to NPCs and that means that every player needs to know or at least consider every method of attack and defense. Rules bloat is a real thing and kills plenty of wonderful ideas. To answer the question you WERE askingFatigue is a major factor in any sort of actual combat. If you watch MMA fighters who train specifically for it at both the beginning and end of fights there is a huge disparity.,rpg,d18wv3g,2,t5_2qh2s
6992457,0,t1_d17x5ag,gtNo no your reward for becoming a vampire in the first place is becoming the pawn of an older wealthier more connected monster playing at human.That older vampire is also likely being manipulated by an even older vampire and so on. In fact pretty much every vampire created after the third generation was created by an older vampire that merely wanted a more trustworthy vessel to help carry out their will more or less. Thus is the way of the Jyhad.The mechanical reason for Jyhad was to give the player a sense of purpose right out of the gate. It fills in the cracks of questing that are normally empty in your average dungeon crawl and it ties up loose ends in the lore. Its the driving force that answers the questions that crunchers forget to ask Why would a powerful vampire ask anyone else to do something for them? Why would an immortal predator create progeny that they have to compete with for blood?Without answering these questions the entire game concept becomes meaningless.,rpg,d18xrfg,3,t5_2qh2s

Rocket Age is set in an alternate s where interplanetary travel is possible and every planet or well certain moons near the planets in our solar are inhabitable by humans.    Combat is simple but the game encourages taking unique approaches to encounters. Talkers go first followed by doers followed by runners followed by fighters. Thats the way turns go.    If you like the system but not the setting dont worry. The Vortex System is pretty easy to adapt to other settings.

7038372,0,t1_d1d71i4,Hey! Glad to hear from you. Sorry for the late reply I dont check reddit as often as I should The premise of the game is that long ancient gods and spirits ruled the earth. They carved out territory had human followers etc. As time went on they collectively realized that they were growing weaker and so came up with a plan.Together they would plant their power to lie dormant within humanity. As humans spread and prospered so to would their power grow. When the time is right they will reawaken and harvest their power from the many MANY humans on earth.Luckily you play as one of the few who is able to tap into this power. When the gods return your power awakens. Its incredible and unstoppable but youre still learning to control it. Sometimes you can wrestle a hydra when other times you may damage yourself and your own teammates. If you can learn to control that power then you will Be The Hero!Note Ive also created a few other settings for the game to take place in but the common thread is that players start out as powerful as they can be...the trick of the game is that they have to learn how to control their cards and their dice while their ingame persona is controlling their power.Often Ill finish a game and a player will remark I was JUST getting the hang of it! Thats the goal.,rpg,d1e5mba,2,t5_2qh2s

Clean and concise combat rules variety in combat beyond narrative readmechanically not Impactful variations easy system for building adventures as a DM and lots of interesting builds for PCs.It was almost too perfect though. The huge array of options available to a character each combat turn actually tended to reduce player agency since no one ever seemed to think outside the box ever. Combats sometimes felt more like puzzles to solve than fights to win. Some of the debuffs creatures inflicted were awful too. In a world where a combat turn often took  minutes to process being stunnedlosing your turn was fucking clown shoes. Dazed iirc was not much better.I still think it was the best edition overall though mostly because it clearly delineated players who wanted to fight tough complex fights and experience epic stories through the context of encounters from players who just wanted to talk like every fantasy dwarf ever quote Lord of the Rings constantly and hum the fucking victory music from Final Fantasy.,rpg,d1eepf6,3,t5_2qh2s

Then its not a dreaful place is it?. He should have said something about it though rather than expecting everyone else would go with his theme. But most likely he got to play realised play had discarded the isle of dread and now its too late to do anything about that well not entirely  cursed teleport recall to the isle for example. So the thing he liked the isle got wrecked right at the start of play he got pissed and couldnt restrain his pissedness.gt edit more thoughts it comes down to respecting the playerGM dynamic.

You could try HeroQuest RPG but this one is mechanically lighter then Fate so probaoly not what you are lookrng for.BRP is an old school game you have social skills sure but you dont have a social hp equivalent which limits the social combat options somewhat. But it does have sanity rules After all this is the same underlying system as Call of Cthulhu. Two other old school game you could try would be GURPS and BESM. Gurps has some of the best settings books in the industry but it can be a complicated system. BESM is an explicitly anime themed system it plays lighter then Gurps but the character build system is almost as detailed and yes it supports Mecha.

7185806,0,t1_d1tctgy,I think the answer to this is not to run experienced fullytrained magic users or in this case jedi alongside nonmagicusers that arent legendary themselves. Once you get up to that legendary level though youre totally right  unless the GM is allowing the nonmagic people to basically do magic with skills any spellcaster who isnt using a particularly limited kind of magic is going to be able to do everything a nonmagic character can do and more. Which is where magic systems with limitations should come in. DampD has a problem of having to do everything thats ever been done in the fantasy genre and this shows in its magic  gotta have a spell for everything. Add to this that all abilities need to have rules for how theyre accessed and you end up with spells per day being the only real limitation. Star Wars has its own brand of this problem  theres a huge list of things force users have done in the movies shows books comics and games. But what isnt really detailed in those media is the training required to be good at those things. Start your jedi off as padawans and require a lot of investment to be good at any of those things and you end up with just another thing characters could specialize in. Piloting telekinesis mind tricks negotiation... whatever works for the situation.But then I tend to enjoy specialization. I like having a tool that will work in many situations and knowing what other party members to rely on for situations in which I dont have a tool.

If you have no where else to turn for players consider playing online with roll and video conference over Skype.

He was surprised by how the situation turned out. So in this situation if he had been more patient tried to steer the situation or made solid suggestions instead of teamkilling it might have gone betterIm playing over roll and Im having trouble striking a balance between being the leader since nobody ever seems to speak up amp try to do something or interact with NPCs and making sure Im not hogging the spotlight.

For example you could have A A sandbox where PCs wander around and the players just hope by chance they run into something that relates to the PCs drama filled motivations. or B The GM makes up some stuff that relates to the PCs drama filled motivations that can be dropped in wherever the PCs go.Except structured narrative all too easily ends up at C  Theres a plot  you go from location  to  to  and if you deviate you get dirty looks from the GM and other players.Id get not wanting to do A but Id fear structured narrative will over steer away from A right over to C.If you ever get the chance to look at spiritual attributes in the riddle of steel RPG you might find them interesting as well.,rpg,d28pjq5,1,t5_2qh2s

They loved the campaign more in its earlier stages when I was framing them more and they had fewer options.To give an idea of what Im talking about prep time and such. I was running a Drow campaign in Forgotten Realms. All my players were from the same house House FeyBranche for those familiar with it. But I had literally named and backstoried every single NPC working for the house  not just the nobles but every single person going from the cook to the musicians and the coin makers to the slaves. I also had the names of every young male drow in MeleeMagthere The Fighter academy and their dispositions towards their house others nobles or lesser drows fighting styles levels and equipment.When the campaign died the players had traveled to the city of Chaulssin but had received new orders to go to the surface rejoin the drowraid they were technically members of but got sidetracked by their guide to Chaulssin. Long story and sabotage the raid. This meant actually a lot of reading about the orcs that were working for the drows and a lot of figuring out the actual military structure of that drow raid  how many members per units? How many units total? What was each units duties who did they report to? What is each of these drows personal agenda and how could the players learn of them and put that to use.Quite a lot of work but I was willing and still am to go through those motions because these are the kind of games I like to run. Open ended ones with people following their own motivation.Player agency was never an issue as far as I felt  they did quite a number of things differently than I had anticipated but I was always ready for them because I knew what every npc was trying to accomplish when the players stumbled on them.,rpg,d29ihwt,6,t5_2qh2s

Heres whygt Can you come up with any rules or rules systems that are or would be predominantly instructional?Requesting examples of this thing I call a textbook rule but dont know how to describe very well is a bit like making the request hey theres this thing Im going to call a lionelle and I dont really know what its like except maybe that its an animal with four legs  has anybody seen one?The responses youd get would be all manner of things cats dogs bears deer and on and on because you simply havent given us a good enough criteria to identify examples for you. Its putting the cart before the horse I think to ask for examples of this thing I dont really know how to identify or explain.So instead of trying to find examples that fit a kind of poorly understood concept because for all we know many of them might not be what youre looking for at all Im going to focus on helping you to solidify the concept itself by answering thisgt Is my proposed distinction useful? Well lets start with what you do think you know about these things. What they have in common is that both of them are rules they may not be the only sorts of rules and it may be possible for them to coexist or exist on a gradient. What sets them apart is even less clear.For example you describe law rules as something thatgt serve to moderate player interactions and resolve disputes ... resolution mechanics ...So thats great. Resolution mechanics tell you what procedure you perform in situation X.But then you describe textbook rules like thisgt serve to inform and teach players to do things they wouldnt figure out on their own.So rolling a d to simulate attacking a goblin is something I wouldnt figure out on my own. But thats a law rule. So wheres the difference?Maybe its in the formatting. Maybe a textbook rule says something like generally try not to fight goblins  theyre dangerous! while a law rule says something like goblin hit points gt player hit points goblin damage gt player damage.But thats just the same message again. Making a distinction there would be like being very specific about how while  and  are equal they are written in different ways. Its technically a distinction but not very useful.Maybe textbook rules say something like when you fight goblins be sure to give the other players a turn at the action while the law rules say something like you get  actions on your turn then the turn passes to the player on your right. No thats the same thing again.Perhaps textbook rules deal with different topics than game rules. Maybe they tell you hey be sure to bring food to the game. But then what if the game has a rule that gives you a bonus at fighting goblins if you bring food? Thats a law rule isnt it? And arent they encouraging the same behavior? It seems like I can do this for any topic so then were still stuck at formatting.Personally I dont see much of a distinction yet as you have described them and Ive run through a few possibilities but they seem to come up wanting. Can you provide any more detail or find an error in my suggestions so that we can provide a better criteria for finding examples of textbook type rules?,rpg,d2h9u5g,3,t5_2qh2s

7416244,0,t1_d2kur4v,For what I am currently working on I thought about what actions were considered evil and I spread a bit of it to each of  nations. The main precampaign story point is a massive plague that killed  out of  people. Each nation rationalized one thing that most would consider evil.One nation has renounced all gods and decided there is only this one life...and as such it is right to extend it however possible. Including necromancy. But because they see life very much as a struggle against nonexistence they look down on some other evil things like disrespectful treatment of dead bodies. One nation sees the plague as a sign we had grown too weak. So they have embraced a more primal survival of the fittest mentality. This includes things like doing whatever you want to those weaker than you and if I think someone I kill would make a good meal that is my right. Another has given up most semblances of free will submitting to the rule of an elder dragon. While she has taken reasonably good care of those that follow her any resistance to her plans are dealt with swiftly. Etc,rpg,d2l6g8w,2,t5_2qh2s

Ive never been a fan of plot hooks  if the player doesnt bite nothing happens and theres no real obligation for them to bite and reasons why they might not want to.Rather than wait for him to follow your hook bring the action to him. Instead of having him passively see something in the distance requiring him to go and actively investigate it have it happen right in his face where he cant ignore it. If you want him to meet up with the group just have them run into each other at the top of the escalator or something. If he decides not to go find his friends after being treated have the medical bay come under attack or a medical emergency he has to help with happens or ... I dunno just something happening right there that cant simply be ignored or that there are consequences for ignoring.As the GM you have the power to frame the scene as you like. Rather than starting the scene at a point of low action and laying out things he can follow up but doesnt have to start it with something happening that he cant ignore.

Whenever I need a name I quickly skim over a list and pick one. I cross it off so that I make sure that I dont use the same one twice. As for plots I mostly run oneshots or fairly short campaigns  sessions so its not generally a big deal. Ill have an idea in my head like A wizard gives the party a magic gem and tells them that it fits into the hilt of a legendary sword owned by an ancient hero. They go to the heros tomb but the sword has been stolen by an evil wizard. So they have to go to his evil tower to get the sword. Is it gonna be the greatest story ever told? No but itll hardly be incoherent. And besides Im hear to help tell the players story not to just spoonfeed them a novel with combat minigame intermissions.  But I dont generally bother prepping any of the details. I dont draw out dungeon layouts or write down how much gold the evil wizard has in his tower. If I need monsters I pull stats from SRDs or websites and tweak stuff as needed take the stats for a dire bear give it extra armor remove the claw attacks and make its bite poisonous.

I try not to use alignment terms in these discussions since they have so many different meanings but I do try to come up with some guidelines that we can both agree on which meet a few criteria. Make sense for the deity a battle god probably doesnt care all that much about providing succor to the poor but may have a thing against slavery or denying someone the chance at glory. I want to make sure these fit with the character as envisioned by the player so its mostly me prompting the player to think about this stuff.. Fit with the style of game  in a pirate campaign Im not going to insist that a pc play a lawabiding conformist. Even a paladin would get to use the internal concept of lawfulness ie he has a personal code that he follows despite the law of the land .

7575908,0,t3_4j11la, Big dice pools would be annoying to tally up. Id rather deal with numeric bonuses than dice pool bonuses. Its faster to look at one die and say I rolled a   bonus is  than to roll  dice  base  bonus count the hits and report  successes. That goes double for your system because your base and bonus dice are different. This would be extremely annoying for a player whose ds had pips and ds had numbers. Rolling for attack and defense leads to a swingier game with more dice to count. My advice is to make defense values numeric and have the attack roll determine an attacks success or failure. Give players defensive options if you really want them involved in the process of defending.  Advantagesdisadvantages seem arbitrary. That kind of random complication is fine in a ruleslight game but it doesnt work in a tactical game at all. Say youre one of five players. Youre fighting six enemies. You roll poorly and go last in the initiative order. Whatever plan you had  turns ago has been completely destroyed by  turns of the GM inflicting advantages and disadvantages willynilly. Now imagine how bad this would be if defenders could receive addisad and characters had multiple attacks per round.Id rehabilitate this system by simplifying the dice mechanics to allow for greater scaling and by centering the games core mechanics around the tactical choices the players make in combat.Changelog dd system now pure ds. Base dice succeed on a  or higher . Modifier dice succeed on a  or higher  up from . Buffing modifier dice encourages players to engage in the tactical gameplay that generates modifiers. Dice of the same type combine.  modifier dice combine to  successes.  base dice combine to  success. This reduces randomness and keeps dice counting down. Addisad system entirely reworked. Attack successes generate advantage points equal to the margin of success attack failures generate disadvantage points equal to the margin of failure. These teamwide points allow the acting character to buy perks from predefined lists.,rpg,d33ce8s,1,t5_2qh2s

This doesnt have to be permanent It would mean the GM designing multiple goals and then the players deciding to pursue them simultaneously in two smaller groups. This doesnt have be permanent. Each arc could be designed to take  sessions to accomplish at which point the group could come back together and decide how to split up for the next set of goals.A good variant of the latter can also be troupestyle play. First developed for Ars Magica each player has a Wizard and theres a collectively pool of nonWizard characters. Generally each session was about one or two Wizards pursuing some goal with the other players picking up some of the characters from the collective pool to round out the rest of the group for that week. This has antecedents in the earliest DampD campaigns which were designed with the expectation that each player would have a stable of characters but would generally only be playing one of them in any given session.

However the main question becomes Do I want to keep changing this game from what it says or would it be easier to find a different game that already does that?Because theres almost always a game that does that.ampnbspHeck I redid Space Combat completely for my SWN game because I found it boring and unengaging but loved the rest of it.,rpg,d39tbvk,14,t5_2qh2s

Nothing more comprehensive or really all that different. e was especially bad about putting pretty much a number to anything it feasibly could  there were tables to roll for NPC reaction modified by diplomacy roll DCs a lot of replacing roleplaying with rollplaying. I understand the use rolls to adjudicate actions but e e .e PF all the same game with some published houserules really definitely took this to an extreme.Compare to the skill system of CoD DampD definitely comes up unfavorably. Most Skill modified by set attribute systems fall fairly short and are very linear and clumsy when it comes to real world  that is fantasy world  problem solving.And there are better skill systems than CoD.

Ford being in fever having played through scripted scene way to many times asked cant I just shoot him?. And they loved it. Its your players who make big things small and small things big. Not the scenario.You are a GM. Unless youre playing some indie metanarrative game its your responsibility to create a scenario. Dont rely on mechanics. Create good scenarios and if they turn into dungeon crawls you did something wrong. Or simply thats what players want.How are you going to use rules where you should use your imagination? During fights you use rules to determine what enemies do? Say you roll on a random table add modifiers calculate threat and on that decide determine what are enemies doing?Other than that players have tendencies to make really weird choices messing with your campaign. Your mechanics would have to take that into account too. Unless youre railroading and like in Mario they can go anywhere they want. As long as its right.But I do recommend reading on how are moviesbooks composed. Read some quotes by bigger writers and filmmakers. Like Hitchcock he has some nice things to say on plot. Maybe King. Theres no improvement without proper study.Is it just me or nowadays people want special mechanics for EVERYTHING in rpgs? Special stealth mechanics. Special parrying with their weapon mechanics.

Give them some sort of reward for it some exp some leftover items renownnotoriety someone in the next village can congratulate them on coming unharmed and plot hook them.  They can also ambush them but halfway there realize that it was a bad idea and get routed. The party gets their rewards and perhaps a plot hook. Give the bandits an advantageous starting position like cover and a difficult path to get to them prepared traps decoys and such. It all depends on how did you intend for them to prepare. Make a table for it like if they hire a knight he counters the enemies that would throw grease or nets on the party. If they hire rangers those could prevent the boars sent to damage and slow the carts in an extremely disadvantageous ground but instead the caravan stops ft later so they dont have to walk over caltrops to get to the skirmishers. Again it depends on what you have considered for the ambush.It really depends on the GM how he would give clues to the party that there might be an ambush or what are their options to prepare for it.

Major fail you either give up or try again but next time you cant put  so youll have to at least retry twice. Security of the PC.  No problem.   Terror.   Trauma.

And as a DM if my players want to do something totally against their alignment Ill try to make it happen somehow.  Example Player CharacterLawful Good the typical case of diz dosnet fit yo alinemanned wants to eat his freshly deceased friends heart. Why? Because the player thinks that this would be pretty nice. Obviously this wouldnt fit into lawful good right? Well the deceased PC was a dragonborn and the kinda fucked up PC speaks draconic. So he clearly spent some time living with dragonborns and learned their culture  which includes of course burial rituals. Of course it is just natural for the fucked up PC to know that they have a very special technique of cutting open the deceased dragonborns chest taking the still beating heart and eating it. The technique is so special that the other PCs couldnt even remember it which were disgusted as fucked up PC offered them a bite as if nothing was wrong with it and left the ingame room.  So if you can as a DM never let a player not do anything. Make it fit its your responsibility.,rpg,d40pszp,-2,t5_2qh2s

7940807,0,t1_d48m4r6,I and the previous GM have tried pushing many many times with the various people in this group. I dont even know how many times Ive said or heard something like thisMy character explains the situation to the Duke.Okay so explain it. or Okay what does that sound like?And the player would haltingly begrudgingly give a typically terse reply incharacter.And five minutes later the same thing would happen with the same or another player.And thats typical of most of the games Ive played with most groups since I was a kid. At best theres one or two people with theater or improv experience but most of them require constant pushing if you want incharacter speech. Only one exception comes to mind  a single group of people in college who were into more experimental RPGs.But like I said in the post after a night of Fiasco this scenario just didnt come up in the first game I ran of the actual campaign. It didnt happen a single time over the course of about three hours that were primarily comprised of social interactions. No one had to be pushed.Even when weve pushed people to speak in character for an entire regular session forced every bit of abstracted speech into incharacter speech Ive never seen it just automatically happen with no pushing at all the next session.No one had to be pushed while playing Fiasco either  speaking in character is the entire game. If you are playing Fiasco you are speaking in character. The only way to avoid speaking in character is to refuse to play so theres no pushing necessary.I think thats the key. Getting everyone speaking in character all in the same game and doing pretty much just that for an extended period of time over the course of one night is not a thing you can easily make happen in say DampD or th Age or even Dungeon World. Youre going to have to push hard to make that happen and design a whole session to facilitate it if you want it to be the main kind of interaction for a full nights game robbing the players of a lot of agency for the session and many systems will fight you the entire way with things like combat and skill abstractions.With Fiasco it just happens. Thats what Fiasco is.I mean yes ultimately youre trying to put a nail into a plank and if you whack it hard enough with a screwdriver itll go in but you might have more luck with the hammer.Edit Also like I mentioned in the post this isnt the first group Ive tried this with. Its had a positive effect every time Ive done it. I decided to make a post because Ive mentioned the value of running Fiasco in a fair few comments in this and related subs and just had an experience doing it again with even greater results than its produced in the past.Youre absoutely right that its a product of taking them out of their comfort zone. Fiasco isnt some magic salve that inexplicably causes people to speak incharacter its just a particularly great pretty foolproof tool for taking people out of this particular comfort zone.,rpg,d48mcy3,15,t5_2qh2s

Incharacter speech is best applied in jovial public or heat of the battle situations.

7945211,0,t3_4o2ejz,My suggestion would be to push the pace as quick as possible.  If the game doesnt feel frantic it wont be entertaining for the watchers. The key to doing that is giving the players more power to assert story facts than they would normally get depending on what system you are used to. Remind the players that this is a one time deal and that its ok to push the envelope not to play it safe. If you are playing a game with a GM then the GM will also have to ramp up the conflict levels both physical and mental. To be entertaining lean more towards a cinematic rather than realistic play style and keep things moving.As far as systems go you might want to try something like Fiasco or All Outta Bubblegum  fast and story centric with lots of potential for conflict. If you want to play a more traditional game like DampD Id suggest taking a look at Burning Wheels Sword scenario or one of the other BW demo scenarios that are floating out there for ideas on building conflict and pushing story.,rpg,d4946sp,1,t5_2qh2s

They typically fall into one of two categories an ally of one faction of Doomsayers radiation mages or a hunter of Doomsayers.Why Jack Spade? The game uses playing cards as part of its mechanics which I thought was cool so barring one of the other suits and because in Deadlands spades are the best I went with the Jack of Spades.Jack was a wellrounded survivor big and strong gutsy but not foolish who also happened to have a pair of humansized wasps wings growing out of his back fully functional. Jack and his companions fought the pure concentrated evil that inhabited the irradiated ruins of postapocalyptic America.During one such struggle however he was cut down trying to take out a pair of heavymachinegun nests that were being operated by one of the big evils of the game the paramilitary group known as the Combine.That isnt the end of his story however. One of the common themes in Deadlands is that the dead have risen and walk again. Now this wasnt to happen naturally for Jack but a friend of his a Junker performed some supernatural cybernetic surgery and built a resurrection device to bring him back to life as something known as a Harrowed the players version of sentient zombie. Now the death wounds Jack had suffered resulted in the loss of his wings one arm and one leg but these were replaced by cybernetics powered by the manitou thats Indian for demon that was also animating his corpse.Jack was back in the fight against evil. We fought some major foes and Jack was able to weather even the most deadly enemies. However Jack would finally give up the ghost though when a travelling companion who was seeking revenge against a cyborg nemesis set off an EMP  only temporarily knocking out the villian but catching Jack in the radius and frying everything that was binding his spirit to his body killing him for good this time.,rpg,d4boja1,2,t5_2qh2s

Also try and find a voice of yours you like for your character this does not need to be different than your own voice just get in the habit of saying I want to do X or What do you think other PC characters name?And repetition. Say a line acknowledging something another character said I agree SpoonOfCrazyDoom over and over and over again until it sounds like gibberish and has no meaning.

It might be a little embarrassing but I have thought through the situation plenty of times and both logically and rationally I know theres no reason to fear it. So one thing I do to break myself out of the pattern of being tonguetied and to shake the current bit of fear I might be experiencing is to think of something that makes me angry.Just a quick thought of something like an asshole drifting into my lane without their signal lights is enough to snap me out of the thoughttrain Im currently on so that I can readjust and proceed with speaking in public.Anyways thats the best advice I got.

8027792,0,t3_4p3piv,Personally I dont care if people narrate in first or third person and interactions between party members dont always need to be done in character when its things like simply planning splitting loot etc. However interacting with NPCs I encourage first person talking. Granted it depends on the situation. Sometimes a situation is not important enough to roleplay an entire conversation so Ill allow narration to cover it. Most of the time if its a nameless faceless NPC Ill allow narration but still prefer in character dialogue. Any important NPC will require actual dialogue to interact with unless its trivial stuff and the NPC is on very good terms with the party Im not going to make a party roleplay handing a item or weapon to someone who trusts them for example. The general idea is that roleplay should make the game more intersting not simply slow it down so roleplaying mundane tasks and conversations can often be skipped especially with NPCs that already have a well established character.Ive also seen some people talk about how much players should benefit from good roleplay on their social skill roles. How I typically handle this is that they dont get anything for delivery but they do get stuff for ideas. So if they roleplay out how they are going to blackmail someone they are going to do better than just saying they blackmail them. I dont see this as giving a benefit for being good at social skills IRL because I dont judge how well they execute their ideas just what the actual plan is. They could in theory do worse due to roleplay if their plan is particularly bad or flawed in some way that they didnt realize. The important thing about roleplay is that it allows more texture to the situation so things about the NPC they are interacting with can be taken into account. I also of course dont let them roleplay around bad stats and remind them when their character might not be intelligent or wise enough for a particular idea. I dont prevent them from doing said idea I leave that judgement up to them I just remind them to keep social stats in mind if they are playing above their stats. Even idiots can have a brilliant idea now and then so its up to the players to decide how to let their low scores effect them in character.,rpg,d4iedjo,1,t5_2qh2s

We also dont need to go overboard with modifiers to make a mighty hero be mighty. With a d its a flat  chance of landing on any number so you can get some wildly variable results and its only when you start to get some crazy modifiers like  do things stabilize out a bit. Some folks like the wildness and its a totally viable preference but it felt wrong for Unitys balancing. With d we can run with more conservative modifiers making a gain of  feel significant and still achieve that stability.Mechanic Support and Fun A layer of tactical depth is available via simple resource management for each class i.e. Mana Fury Guile Faith etc. fueling powers Rolling d and getting doubles gives us a fun avenue to recharge resources thats random but still frequent  chance. Its another chance for a player to feel good and celebrate baked into each roll.,rpg,d59mxt8,15,t5_2qh2s

8285776,0,t1_d5bya26,Im thinking that losing your anchor should almost always turn you into a witch by blowing out trauma. Getting a new one seems unnecessary  games of this seem like they shouldwould be short and sharp. Losing your anchor is probably going to send you straight to the end of the deathspiral or nearenough. Im not imagining it being a hugely long game  Madoka is pretty shortandsharp.Besides Grey Ranks there are two other systems that I think are highly relevant for ripping ideas from Dont Rest Your Head and Bliss Stage. DRYH has the whole deathspiral where you either go mad or die depending which way you spiral. I think you could play Madoka with this system decently well. Bliss Stage is a mecha game focused around relationships think Evangelion. It also has an anchor though its a bit different.Random brainstorming It might be cool if the adversary i.e. Kyuubei was a character with his own goalsmechanics rather than just a pawn of the GM. Either that or he could be a shared resource that the other players use. Having him set missions in the early game and shift into a key antagonist in the later game could make for a good pacing mechanic.Also no reason why going fullwitch should turn you into an NPC. A finalbattle between a witchform PC and other PCs would be much cooler if controlled by that characters owner.,rpg,d5da47k,1,t5_2qh2s

The players would hear rumors about some sort of dark happenings around a nearby ruined castle or barrow or something. When they get there and kick the evil out they would find a artifact stone portal that they can get working to show various interdimensional worlds with different struggles. They can jump into the portal and help out fixing the problems and then jumping back through the portal. Heavily inspired by Stargate and Quantum Leap and even Doctor Who. ,rpg,d5go11d,1,t5_2qh2s

Fudging is thus the best way to make sure you dont either kill your PCs left and right or on the other hand give them challenges so easy its just a tedious task.By fudging you can make sure fights always end up with players on the verge of defeat grasping victory by actually working for it and not just sweeping thru it.Fudging is fine in a DampD style game I think.,rpg,d5hn7r8,-1,t5_2qh2s

Most of the big names have already been mentionedDungeon World attempts more to replicate the feel of DampD specifically its dungeoncrawling and does it via the narrativedriven PoweredbytheApocalypse system and a d base roll.th Age was made by the lead designers of rd and th Edition DampD and tries to correct for DampD by continuing th Editions tradition of having all character classes having diverse incombat and outofcombat options marrying it to a completely gridless set of rules and a skill system that emphasizes improvization over skill lists and simulationist physics.The OSR is a diverse subgenre of games although theyre largely restatements or reinventions of older versions of DampD so if you already didnt want to just go to previous editions you might want to look at these games very closely because for the most part youre essentially doing just that.GURPS is yet another option but then GURPS practically already does everything as long as you apply the right rulessourcebooks.,rpg,d5r7owd,7,t5_2qh2s

Higher skills also translate to critical successes on rolls. A  if your skill is  and  if your skill is .

The creator of the game regularly hangs out there maybe they can offer some insight on how combat is being run at your table.Just a thought before you completely abandon ship for something that might be fixable...Either they will confirm you were right all along and you need a new system or youll have a guideline for running combats with a different mindset.Since injuries roll up three gunshots is fatal.  If PCs miss their Open FireLaunch Assault rolls choose the suffer harm option so they have to Brace for Impact. If they miss on a Brace for Impact roll that gives you license to increase the severity of the damage they are already taking thats straight from the rule book. So someone could be one step away from death after one Open Fire exchange if they dont nail all their rolls. Seems like the combat could be a little too deadly if the GM doesnt have any restraint and that before throwing in any major debilitates in that force players to undergo surgery to remove them just like with Critical injuries.,rpg,d621p17,1,t5_2qh2s

The Knights try to stop the demons attacking or infiltrating but are hampered by the suns hypnotising effects on the people  especially in twilight.

It puts you in the shoes of a martial artist mystic utilising both physical and spiritual energy.Character building is point based.Resolution is D dice pool based with the size of the pool determined by the ranks of two skills.Physical energy can be used to enhance your capabilities increasing your stats.Spirit energy can be manifested into blasts and other attacks.WBS uses a custom DeclareResolve initiative system in which you declare an action then it resolves when you go again. Faster moves let you go again quicker so that level of strategy is there as well.Because of the setting it works fine as a drop indrop out system as it is easy to justify another character doing things like training or other personal goals.It also works well with a small group as it is classless so abilities of enemies arent expecting the Holy Trinity.You can find the sub here,rpg,d6gklfa,1,t5_2qh2s

So youll want to fuck up your enemies to stop them getting ahead of you. Obviously theyll want to do the same to you. So you make a proxy.  There are different ways to make proxies.

8736437,0,t3_4zp44m,Youre talking about Masks and their influence on RPGsMany people take RPG characters as masks that let them explore parts of humanity that arent part of their public face. I think its jumping to conclusions to assume these are internal obsessions insecurities or biases. It could be anything from attempting to understand that type of person reacting to others who are making that type of player characters or it could be internal characteristics the person has themselves.The social pressure to play right often leads people to make a mask thats incredibly distant from them personally...and this mask does not do things they would do publicly or privately but does horrible things because theyre internally consistent with what the person thinks about the character genre game or setting. The social pressure to play well often leads people to make buffoons or people unlike themselves who they do not understand well. This is so there is emotional distance from the characters performance and their own real life proficiency. This is reduced as time and trust shows that its alright to play serious drama oriented characters.

Now thats solely about individual taste even more so than the above.You are right  that sentence made no sense. I changed it to witnessing a setting. Maybe there are better words for it.

They should have enough heft to them that they can shape the world they are in.A simple Example just to illustrate I may be Stormtrooper  out of  but if I suddenly decide that I shoot my superior  that should change the behavior of the rest of the troops.

8848327,0,t3_51etg3,Youve figured out an important truth about creativity. You cannot be both analytical AND creative at the same time. In writing this means you need to either dump everything on paper and then analyzereview later or you need to meticulously come up with ideas and filter them as you go this is less efficient and results in most people never quite getting in the zone. An important aspect of improvisation and creative work in general is being able to turn off this filter. Your issue is arising because you are using your critical and analytical filters during a time when you are meant to be using your creativeimprovisational mind during play.I think you need to look into games which are about emergent storytelling rather than railroading and premade stories. I think this will help you get out of that criticalanalytical mindstate because they force you to stop thinking about a story as a concrete construct that exists ahead of time. These types of games also naturally result in more complicated or interesting narratives because they arent created by any single person. They are created by all of the different threads that all of the players bring to the table woven together in a complicated and unique way. Here are some more emergent and characterdriven games  Burning Wheel Apocalypse World HillfolkDramasystemYou may also want to play GMless games like  Fiasco Microscope The Quiet YearId also recommend you read some books about improvisation.

8884456,0,t1_d7f670g,Copypasta of what Ive said about Lehmans games in a previous threadPolaris by Ben Lehman is rather unique. Each player is a Knight of the Utmost North in war against the Mistaken. Each turn one player is well the player the guy in front of him is the Demon who plays adversary NPCs and the two others are the moon they play nonadversary NPCs and act as referees.  The Knight does what he wants to achieve his goals the narration is pure freeform so you can literally do whatever you want but at any point when you do something the Demon can interrupt you with a price to pay by saying But only if ltpricegt. You can accept refuse or add another gain with But only if ltgaingt. It goes on until someone seals the deal.  It makes for a very tragic Shakespearean experience. I highly recommend it.By the same author Bliss Stage is also pretty unique. Youre children fighting giant murderous robots by using your feelings toward one another to summon your own giant robots. The more you fight the more your relationships or yourself get hurt while you desperately try to make up with everyone.  Still by Ben Lehman Hot Guys Making Out a yaoi game. One player is the hot mysterious heir to a noble family the other the disarming klutz young orphan.

8902874,0,t1_d7hvcxc,gt The issue here is that the usual method for converting games into strip games operates by attaching the amount of clothing worn to the metric by which how well someone is doing in the game. Thus allowing it to fluctuate in a natural way which enhances the tension already created by the gaming atmosphere by rewarding or punishing good and bad strategies. This also has the inbuilt advantage that since games tend to be built to be more or less fair and with enough randomness to assure one person doesnt completely dominate. That can ruin these kinds of games if one person is way behind everyone else that is a recipe for increased awkwardness. Another way is to allow some kind of bonus to be gained by spending items of clothing. This has to be considered in terms of balance obviously especially as it allows more outgoing players to gain an immediate advantage over the more awkward. As such it is used less. It also needs to be a very strong incentive in order to create a situation in which people feel they are justified by the situation which is helpful in allowing people to lower their inhibitions.gtThe other issue youre facing is that neither of these work for Microscope. The game has no metric by which the players are measured so there is no logical point in the mechanics to allow for the losing of clothing. The second method could work by allowing people to create one additional periodeventscene per round if they lose an item of clothing but that may not be enough of an incentive to get the more shy players to use it. The game is noncompetitive so theres no advantage to framing additional scenes. That would defeat the overall design goal of adding a strip element to games which requires the rules to either say that a player has to strip or very strongly incentivize it. In my opinion its to allow normally nervous people an outlet by creating a situation where the social contract dictates they have to take off clothing. Obviously it is still entirely their choice but the illusion of must prevents them being as uncomfortable with it.FTFY,rpg,d7hzwq1,16,t5_2qh2s

9076313,0,t3_54kvt7,Well this might not be applicable everywhere considering we play in a homebrewed system but we have the following setup when having puzzlessimilar   Is it a deadly challenge with a largeimportant payoff?  If yes the player uses their narrative and thinking skills to try to find a way to solve it. That means the player can winsolve it almost always if they try well enough. Did the player fail in that?  If yes we introduce the dice. Now the challenge rises and the story becomes more intense as the characters stats are important now. The narrative approach still applies but the success has a random variable to it. In a way this promotes better cooperation and division of jobs. Did they fail once more?  The party receives a negative effect. It can vary from minor spell effects over moderate wounds and major debilitation to death. It depends on what did they do during the challenge to offset the negative result.Rolls are there to give hints and intensify the situation the overall outcome depends on the players brains. So everything should be solvable without a single roll but if the party gets stuck or has it too easy the GM introduces rolls to keep it challenging or to help the party.ampnbspAn example would be when i was with  other party members in a dungeon we were looking for a key to the deeper level. We got into a room and found a locker with a puzzle in it.  The puzzle was picked up by our guy with the highest INT or similar stat while we guarded the room. The GM gave him on his mobile phone one of those free the red block games and he was working on it. The other two of us were keeping guard.  So an infernal monster came down the hallway and we prepared for a fight barricaded the door while he was still working on the puzzle.  It wasnt really going well for him and the monster broke down the door. So we fought a bit tried to keep it away from our braininac. After a couple of rounds i just tell the guy to drop the puzzle get into the fight with the monster that is way above our level and ill pick up his work.  I solved it way faster got a scroll to get us out of the room and used it.  No rolls except for the taunts and battle. It was solved only by thinking and properly allocating the jobs.The nd room there was a similar setup so i picked up the puzzle considering i managed to solve it easily last time. This time it wasnt really going that well as i got stuck on a certain point going in circles so i got the same guy to assist me. It wasnt going too well and again some monster got into the room. This time i just dropped the puzzle after a round or two and jumped into the battle to help the third guy.  I left our brainiac to work on the puzzle and told him to use his brains this time and roll his stats.  On a sidenote i act sometimes as a coGM due to codeveloping the homebrew so i have a bit of leeway with my suggestions to the GM.  The GM told him to roll his INT stat a couple of times once per round while we were fighting. After he finally passed the DC the GM enabled the hint option in the game and our brainiac finally solved the puzzle finding a similar scroll and getting us out of the room.  This time the rolls were to get us further with the puzzle but in the end it still required us to think on how to solve it. We got wounded due to the inability to solve the challenge in a timely manner.tldr  Brains for puzzles rolls for hints.,rpg,d82tqci,7,t5_2qh2s

We have determined that they are an adult at . But for certain values of maturity we still dont see them as an adult  to drink  to rent a car or with certain exceptions fill out the FAFSA without parental information. There is also a lot of maturing that happens in those years.My thought is it is like that. An elf is physically grown up around the same age as the humans even shares a similar mental maturity but they arent considered an adult in the terms of their people.Hell Im  and people still tell me oh youre young  I consider most not all  year olds to not have things figured out yet.This is how I have dealt with it myself in world building.I am totally digging some of the comments here though and the idea that a longlived race would feel like theyre only just getting to know a human when theyre ready to pass on.

9157428,0,t3_55p66q,First good on you. I think its awesome that people give back to the community like this and the exchange of ideas and information is really a great motivator.I follow and am tangentially involved with some communities that youre talking about and to me they really fall into two broad categories  content and information. Theres obviously a lot of crossover and I think most of the successful guys do a lot of both or at least frame their info discussions around their content so it becomes both. Youve got guys like The Alexandrian and Hack amp Slash talking about these sort of high level ideas surrounding how we play and how to alter the conversation about gaming. On the flip side pages like Ars Ludi and Zak Smith and False Machine throw out gameplay and settings by bits and chunks again also framing the larger how and why. Im not saying you need to specialize in anything but most folks who are successful at what youre talking about do both. I think thats because people that design really rad content often have great ideas about how games are played which then drove that content. And guys with great ideas tend to make neat things. Its a bit one sided to do one without the other I think.Theres also the idea of community and theres a lot of them out there. Some are all space opera some are mostly OSR. Some are big into rules hacks for popular games. It seems like an easier foot in the door is to inject yourself into one of those communities and branch out from there. Again unless youre only into one thing you dont need to isolate yourself but glomming onto a group is an easy way to set yourself up and develop a sounding board and group of friends.Which brings me to the last bit shameless self promotion. Its the internet. You cant make a webpage and expect people to stumble across it. Youve got to network and sell your ideas and brand and be anywhere you can be. You can make the whole argument of if you make good content thats all you need but its just not true in this day and age. Its not really any different than if youre selling knitted crafts on Etsy or trying to promote your Scooby Doo fanfic. If youre making cool stuff and you can get it out there where people can see it which is totally helped along by other people talking about it youre golden. And hail fellow PbPer!

Its the cold war. Three of you play scientistsengineers who have just completed work on The Juggernaut a computer which can predict the future. The other three of you play various skeptical government officials a politicain a general and a spy looking to see if it has applications in your field. You can finish it in about an hour and a half and its a really incredible experience.Same designer Fiasco by Jason Morningstar is a game where you play through coen brothers style dark comedy of awful people failing terribly and its fun and freeform and so so good. Hot Guys Making Out by Ben Lehman. Touching steamy game about forbidden love in the Spanish Civil War. The story is told in scenes each player takes turns playing cards from a normal deck of playing cards and then playing out the scene based on the card they played. Maybe about an hour and a half to play. You know you wanna play this. Whats this? A game that uses dice? Hope thats not too DnDlike for you. This game is called Force Blade Punk by Grant Howitt Its tiny and free. You play teenage murderpop superstars and you get to decide what that means. You only roll dice if theres a conflict and the dice answer the questionsDid I get what I want?Did I get hurt?Am I Ashamed?You might manage to get what you want out of a conflict and not suffer a single scratch but you did it really unstylishly and ungracefully. And what will your fans think of that? Maybe your brand is more important than your health? Keep it in mind. Itras By is a game I cannot recommend. Its a huge impenetrable tome of a book that honestly I could never figure out and I almost think thats the point. But what I can recommend and do recommend are The Cards that it uses. Because oh my gosh. These sure do add a layer of surreality to any game. things like everyone switches roles one to the right including the GM and The person who draws this card now holds a press conference where the other characters can ask them questions or even each player gives a different account of how this scene resolves and the person who drew the card gets to pick which one is true. Wuthering Heights is a game I recommend whenever I can. Its ridiculous and over the top. You play s Emily Bronte style characters in the moors somewhere. Everyone is depressed and poetic and everything is awful and its misty and remember that time that your father walked barefoot into the mist one november morning and never returned and we thought he was dead but hes just now returned to town and is dreadfully rich and is having dinner with the bishop so were going to poison him and steal his money because he abandoned us. Or something similarly grim and strange. I highly recommend starting the game with a funeral that everyone is attending just to set the scene.

9215491,0,t3_56jwi3,traveller  combat goes into more depth with combat using a d system for combat and skills the combat also has more options for stuff.  The space stuff is more in depth and needs way more book keeping than what SWN needs. Also last time I checked there are no sheets for ships. The character creation is more open and allows more different kinds of characters but has a very heavy random element and players might not get to play the characters that they want to play. Psychic stuff is pretty much on par with SWN but if characters are playing Psychic characters at the start they most will be more powerful than starting SWN psychics. way more gear porn and cybernetics and even more to come with the General supply cataolog. No XP no levels only training skills character advancement relies on purely on character downtime and cyberneticsStars Without Number More simple combat the combat is quite simple and choice boils down to shoot psychic power or some noncombat thing. The space stuff is pretty simple and bookkeeping is simple compared to traveller. Character creation has  classes that allow a fairly board array of characters and the only random element is the stats which the players can influence a bit. Psychic stuff is a bit weaker at the start than traveller but players get more and more powerfully than Traveller characters over time. not that much gear porn compared to traveller Character advancement based on XP which is gained from competing goals.Both have there pros and cons it really just comes to taste and what you want from an RPG.,rpg,d8k4r9z,14,t5_2qh2s

Im not necessarily going for a detailed game. Actually Im trying to reduce detail as much as possible while still maintaining realism. Those two are not necessarily dependent on each other because the amount of detail depends on the kind of game youre running. Lets say two knights are fighting each other the other one is faster stronger and younger but less skilled while the other one is a better fighter but not as imposing physically. One system might represent these two knights with several physical stats a few different skills and perhaps even a mental fighting stat. Another system could bake all these different characteristics into a single fighting skill where the knights are equal. other system plays out a whole combat with dozens of rolls and different types of attacks and damage and the end result is the younger knight wins but suffers an injury. The other system gets to the same conclusion with a single opposed skill roll. Both systems were realistic in their own way one with more detail and the other with less.,rpg,d8p205c,1,t5_2qh2s

Maybe even Shepherd cleric? and River some sort of magician  fighter with some license. But there are no classes that can get you even remotely close to Inara or Simon or even Kaylee for their social aspects.While Mal is indeed a fighter some might argue he is a fallen paladin Zoe is a rogue shes stealthy and deadly with a knife. Jayne proves himself to be a low Int fighter and Book is a monk some sort of clerical order but knows how to fight he aint no shepherd. River is an assassin.  Now Inara is clearly a bard thats what companions are trained for they are like Japanese geishas.  Simon is a cleric healer of a deity that condemns violence.  Kaylee is a rogue focusing on technical skills and refusing combat proficiency.  This of course if we go with DampD classes.  But Firefly is a game of Traveller not of DampD.  Take Lord of the Rings and lets go ADampD nd Edition on it.  Aragorn Ranger  Boromir Fighter  Gimli Fighter  Legolas Ranger  Frodo Rogue  Samwise Rogue  Pippin Rogue  Merry Rogue  Gandalf Wizard  See the pattern?  Your being by your own statement newbie to rpg made you look at one narrative example based on the one book that you have skimmed through and thats fine but with time and experience youll find many other games and youll start assigning a game to every narrative based on the closest similarities and many narratives fit more than one game.  Now trying to stick to DampD Firefly think of Mal in the Shindig episode thats the closest you get to a barbarian at a dinner party. It offers many comical relief moments and still manages to get things done.  There are two main currents in roleplaying games.  One which seems to have the majority on this sub believes in strong rules for social interaction getting even to the point of saying combat can be handwaved and strongly abstracted. These people say that mechanics governing roleplay facilitate it.  The other two which I belong thinks that social interaction should be dealt with pure roleplaying while combat should be a tactical exercise. These people say that mechanics governing roleplay hamper it by forcing it into a certain direction.  Neither is better than the other neither is correct or wrong they are just two different approaches play styles if you prefer.  I would advise you to read through the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide from Advanced Dungeons amp Dragons nd Edition.  The DMG has few rules for social interaction which are essential and straight to the point but mainly advises the DM to deal with those social encounters by logic and rather gives lots of info on how to build a complex realistic looking living world.  ,rpg,d97grw3,2,t5_2qh2s

Maybe if he got agaisnt the party or the party itself got distant from him due to his actions from now and the possible future  he would be lead into temptation to even forget his oath and his wrongdoings by choosing the side which he has promissed to fight agaisnt  due to losing all that he cared about to that same hated side.

9501279,0,t3_5aw4pu,Adding to the long list of great advice in this thread...Consider whether the PCs are competent investigators or not. Assuming they are treat them as such give away some many? clues freely as in GUMSHOE or similar games built for investigation a principle easily carried over to any game system but if you want the mechanics to come in make the rolls about how deep they can interpret those clues andor use dice rolls not to find clues or make leaps of logic but to determine how quickly they interpret the clues or deduce specific ramifications.For example finding a funny footprint or seeing tire tracks should be automatic. Figuring out what makes them interesting might call for a dice roll success means you recognize the shoetype or the wheel typesize of the car. Or maybe degree of success tells you how fast you interpret the clues minor success might mean you have to go to the police database and match up car types and wheels or talk to a mechanic or witness to truly figure out the size and shape of the person that left that boot print. A major success means youve seen it before...in fact wasnt that Doctor Piersons car from last weekend?! Get him before he skips town!So whatever system you have think of investigative mechanics like layers. Easily spotted clues to set you on a path to dig deeper.. Easy to find clues but hard to interpret their meaning puzzles tricks what does this REALLY mean?.. Hard to find clues such as wellhidden things or things that only present themselves after other clues have been found and interpreted.. How far is the leap of logic that the investigators have to deduce? Figuring out a mechanic was at the scene of the crime might be easy because of greasy stains or dirty boots but figuring out that it was not the local car mechanic but the police stations own motorpool mechanic is a bigger leap.. How fast can you get from one clue to the next or make a deduction? Some crimes are bound to be repeated can you figure it out before another life is taken or before the badguy leaves town?,rpg,d9k8hao,1,t5_2qh2s

Let the players write up backstories about how they came to be the proteges of these heroic adventurers and let them tell stories about their mentors for flavor e.g. remember when my mentor famed dwarven warrior Baldik Hangstrim knocked out a hill giant with one wellplaced stone to the back of the head?.On this adventure they follow the trail of their mentors and are drawn into a situation that is way over their heads. Perhaps the heroes were investigating a lich a portal to a dangerous plane or just stumbled into the nest of an ancient and nowawakened beast. Have the presence of the level  adventurers be just enough of a nuisance to foil the plans of the BBEG even better if by accident e.g. they unknowingly deactivate the runes that are sustaining the portal or let the BBEGs evil pet out and he loses control of it etc. but not enough to save their mentors. They are killed captured or otherwise indefinitely out of the picture. Your PCs now have a BBEG who will not see them as a threat at this point giving them time to gain levels and experience without fearing a TPK a longterm goal motivation no deus ex machina NPCs and if you write it right they should have some smaller scale goals to work towards investigating the history of the creature plane lich BBEG etc. that are more levelappropriate.I hope some of that is helpful!

9888944,0,t3_5h0g9n,I had a fairly similar situation a couple of years back. I DMed Pathfinder for the last time I hope and caught one of my players cheating on his dice rolls. I talked with a couple of the other players and theyve confirmed theyve seen him cheat in boardgames too including King of Tokyo  and who the hell cheats at a silly lightweight boardgame about giant monsters beating each other up?Long story short I talked to him in private and straight up told him he can either stop cheating or stop playing in my campaign. He feigned ignorance and dropped after a couple more sessions. Which to be honest I was perfectly ok with. My first instinct was just to kick the guy out straight away. RPGs as a tool of shared storytelling need trust between everyone at the table. As a challenge where you defeat monsters and get treasure they need fair and universal rules. Cheating removes both of these things and straight up kills the game. If your friend when called out apologises and promises never to do it again Im sure you can play together just fine  after all its just a game.

9905051,0,t3_5habod,gti wanna know what does it takes to do so like what are the base mechanics every rpg system needs to haveThis was answered by uJaskoGomadwhat you need depends on the general style and goals of the game.gti was thinking of an rpg system that i less based around classes and stats and more based on abilities and ability trees where you receive a certain number of points every time you level up and you can use to learn new skills or level old ones up to level  when some skills are maxed they might be exchanged for a better version of that skill and in order to learn some high level skill you might need to learn some weaker ones etc...To clarify you are looking for  A point buy system with attributes influenced by Abilities and Skills that can be rated up to  at which point they are swapped for a better type of that skill?My question to you is this how is this skill system to function at a mechanical level when you include dice? From your description I have no idea how this would function except perhaps as a tracker to indicate improvement between the true levels of the skill. This is often why pointbuy systems have attributes as their own thing skills often derived and adding on top of the attributes and abilities which modify how the game functions to some degree often requiring that the character meets some prerequisites in ability score or skill level to obtain them.Beyond this basic functionality however it takes quite a lot of effort to write a significant RPG system that can cover most situations especially when you start adding in things like magic and psionics and a bestiary.,rpg,dayngmf,2,t5_2qh2s

9970410,0,t1_db74db3,Out of curiosity what other games have you played? To be honest DampD has nearly nothing to say about the type of game you play other than  of your abilities are combat related.So people will sometimes think that because in DampD the GM has to bear the burden of setting the tone of the game if heshe wants a noncombat game then in all games the GM has to also. This is a faulty assumption. There are many games which set the tone and encourage a play style with the very mechanics themselves. DampD does do this also in a very weakimplicit way by focusing its rules primarily around combat but I will concede that a strong GM can push against this particular games natural leanings. A great example of a game that does this well is surprisingly Old School DampD. In the edition that I am playing BX you get experience primarily through bringing gold back from ruinscavesdungeons. This encourages a very particular style of play and it does it well. It encourages the following behaviors  Exploration to find gold Seeking out rumors of wealth Dungeondelving Trying to find clever ways to avoid nonprofitable combat,rpg,db766iw,7,t5_2qh2s

10213051,0,t3_5m7fb6,gt but the problem was that we were both alpha personalities. The above drew my attention because I think it illustrates a broader trend.  This isnt really a thing that exists in how psychologists understand personality.  I see it in a lot in toxic corners of the Internet like redpill but I can assure you that no modern scholarly framework for understanding human behavior embraces this concept.  That in mind it might be worth reevaluating your perspective on your relationships.  I can see that youre selfaware enough to know youve been rubbing people wrong but why?  Its not just your personality.  Its your behavior.Nevertheless this isnt a counseling session.  Why you do this stuff is a matter for your own consideration but the result is pretty clear.You put so much work into your campaigns only to have those dumb ol players ruin it for you and flake.  So you got more and more bitter and eventually burned out.  This isnt a unique story.  I swear Ive probably read  variations on this post in the last couple years.  The minor details vary but the same core factors emerge over and over again.What happened here is that you fell into a style of GMing that treats players as obstacles to your vision rather than as equal partners in creating it.  You werent playing to find out what happens.  You were playing to see the story youd already envisioned come to life.As people age they grow less and less tolerant of that sort of thing.  It smacks of being told how to play house properly by the older kid down the street.  A six year old will go along with that and have a grand old time.  Adults tolerate it ... if they have to for a while.  But patience wears thin and most people  particularly online  simply dont care enough about you to discuss and resolve it.  Theyd rather just fade away and let you draw your own conclusions. This condition has an antidote and that comes in the form of embracing other people and letting go of the illusion of control.  If you really want to GM and have people stay youve got to give them some of the narrative agency  the ability to make real choices that impact the story in ways you cant anticipate.  Note that that doesnt mean pick from a list of choices I give you.  It means Create your own choice from whole cloth and Ill react to it build on it and send it back to you.  It means truly embracing the tenets of Yes andYes butNo butNo and in that order of preference.In order to do that youve got to abandon the notion that prepping plots and hooks and storylines is a good use of your time.  Prepping a huge world that you understand to the foundations is right out too.  For a deep understanding of this I recommend Gamemastering by Brian Jamison and perhaps a deep reading of Dungeon World or similar narrative game.Failing that ... have you considered writing a book?,rpg,dc1pgu3,56,t5_2qh2s

One to help with food passing out materials tracking props and to find out where everyone is at in their respective stories. And at least one to help with any and all rules. I would say at least GM per about  players. Most of the games I have played each character has their own little story line and secret info that they know. When a player asks them questions about said character info they cannot lie about it. They also have a few leads into other characters that will make them want to ask questions to another player. Sometimes the murderer is among them sometimes the story done differently. Many times the murderer might not even know they are the murderer until the second half of the game when NEW character details are passed out. Some of these games are full on LARPs where anything goes some require you play minigames or earn plot rewards to get access to special abilities like a gunpoisonknifebroken elevator.....to kill another player or get an exclusive clue.,rpg,dc8tk7e,2,t5_2qh2s

Force and destiny focuses around Jedi that either escaped the purge or were trained by someone that escaped the purge. Jedi and their various things basically. The system works for any of the star wars eras but its prebuilt with Episode IV V and VI in mind.Edit its also appropriately lethal not like the old d system or sagas.

10480911,0,t3_5q3tx6,gtJust a few rules that may clash with one another in certain situations.First up these arent rules for lawful good. Theyre guiding lines for what determines if a character is lawful good which is a significant difference.Second Alignment is not a must act this way. Alignment is determined by how a character acts the Alignment itself does not dictate how the character acts. So if you have a character who does their best to never let evil go unpunished that protects their friends and has honour then they should rightly be saddled with a LawfulGood Alignment.gtBut lets say you have just defeated an evildoer and he begs for mercy before you kill him. Should a lawful good character spare him because it would be dishonorable to kill him in a vulnerable state?Its one possible option. But the villain isnt in a vulnerable state. They are in the middle of a fight still. A vulnerable state is akin to being compulsed or manipulated into evil actions. For example a thief who steals in order to feed himself is a person who is in a vulnerable state their actions are compulsive. A thief who steals to eat the rarest meats and drink the finest wines however is not in that vulnerable state.gtOr is it more faithful to this alignment if you kill him in the name of justice? Im speaking of a scenario where delivering the evildoer to the authorities isnt possible.Characters dont have or should not have faithfulness to an alignment. Alignment itself is largely but not wholly a metaconcept that the average person and character have no actual way of knowing. For example a Paladin can detect evil. That does not mean that they know they are good themselves because they have no ability to detect good so their alignment as far as theyre concerned is no different than a dog or cats which are neutral. Very few people have the ability to detect any and all alignments so most people are utterly unaware of what alignment they are.As for killing in the name of justice that is a personalorganizationalreligious motivation not an alignment guideline.gtMoving forward the website I was reading also mentions that you must never lie which I find unrealistic. Nobody is that perfect. Maybe Avoid lying  of the time would be enough?Must is a strong word. But otherwise its really supereasy never to lie. Like if you were going to lie dont. If you need to remain silent on matters where youd want to lie. Its not even unrealistic.gtLastly the list mentions Being taken prisoner as part of the Not To Do list.

10485637,0,t3_5q4obo,My group has been going for about three and a half years and looking at how the campaign is going itll probably be a little over four by the time were done.Like many others have said I broke the campaign into episodes generally using levels as markers for when to switch. We play DampD e so it naturally made sense to make the first arc from levels . That arc mostly took place in the Material Plane though the group went to a couple of other planes but not for long and the overarching problem had to do with retaking a kingdom that a religious group had run a coup on. The end of that arc introduced the true big bad a Void God who had used the war to distract the other Gods while he gathered power.The second arc saw the partys souls banished to another plane purgatorystyle. This took from levels . This plane had been a prison for the Void God so they got to discover some more about his past and the world in general even though that arc wasnt exactly related to the story. Think the TatooineJabba parts of Return of the Jedi.From  they were back in the Material Plane and they found out their bodies had been controlled by this Void God and used for evil means. They spent most of this arc fixing what their bodies had screwed up as well as stopping a powerful crime lord from gaining even more power. At points in this arc the group Cleric got visionsmessages from his deity implying there was some sort of war happening with the Gods. I forgot to mention the party met to their shock the three most powerful deities inside the purgatory from the second arc  they had been stripped of their divinity by the Void God and as revenge he banished them.At the end of the third arc the party now obviously renowned joined the Astral War. This fourth arc was played out in a series of interconnected oneshots not always from the perspective of the main party but sometimes looking at more groundlevel troop movements. I also ran solo sessions for each player which delved deeper into their characters whether it be exploring their past challenging their weaknesses or fears or forcing them to make a character choice.The big MacGuffin during this arc was finding an ancient Temple to a GodtotheGods Demiurgetype being. I will say this arc was more railroady than the others because I got to determine the types of missions the party went on and they were chronologically disconnected from each other. This was my Clone Wars arc to use another Star Wars reference.Theyve finally found this temple and are working their way through it the three deities I mentioned before set up defenses so that no one unworthy could get through. This temple wont be the last of their adventure  theyre going to visit a bunch of new worlds via a dimensional rifttype scenario all in an effort to get to this Demiurge before the BBEG does  and I expect what Ive thought out will take until about August.So theres sort of an overarching plot.

10533344,0,t3_5qs99a,I misread the question didnt see setting. Still tangentially relevant right?Blade of the Immortal Vagabond Lone Wolf and Cub. All three take place in feudal Japan and follow roninesque characters ronin kenshi assassin possessing great skills with their swords and other weapons. Blade of the Immortal has some fantasy elements and takes a lot of liberties but I think it manages to get the feeling of the era across well with e.g. the geisha and various attitudes and designs of the characters. I think what Id make the system focused on would be the fighting however which is deadly fast and dynamic. The characters use all kinds of weapons in all kinds of ways make use of their environment trick each other poison their blades and so on. While reading I have been thinking about this because if I could play a game that has combat play out the way it does in this manga it would instantly be one of my favorites. Vagabond is not very accurate and reads more like a shonen manga. The development is mostly philosophical and I think it would either be very railroady either GM or the system telling you what happens without much input or it would just be the players making shit up. The fighting isnt anything too special though I havent read it all. Lone Wolf and Cub is historical trying to fill in the gap that records leave in the era. It follows a former executioner and his son both for hire mostly for assassination and has incredible political and social plots. An episodic layout without strict connection from one to the next makes a good framework for an RPG and I coudl see PbtA or something similar to that working really well. The fighting is good but not really the focus most of the time and there is philosophical stuff and character advancement that wouldnt really get carried across in an adaption. Its also about a single character and his son so its unsure how well it would work with several PCs.I think Blade of the Immortal would be amazing probably the hardest but it has the smoothest transition if done well I think and should be really fun to play.,rpg,dd22k76,2,t5_2qh2s

10637572,0,t3_5s5zzy,These are three main methods I use to increase subtly increase immersion and playerawareness into the games I GM.First the method that I use for point out clues may seem harsher but it makes the game not feel like the players are being railroaded into each clue and really gets them interested in finding clues themselves instead of the GM shoving clues down their throats. I have the players MISS a clue and make it actually cause  problems for the investigators. This then makes the players a little paranoid and very receptive to further clues or red herrings.For example Player Characters PCs are talking to Lady McTavish the owner of the local tavern. PCs quiz McTavish about the local disappearances she mentions that Johnny Brigham a local homeless person saw someone who looked wrong and shadowy walk by his bridge. If PCs dont follow up on the lead and talk to Johnny immediately I would have another NPC say that Johnny came into their diner last night and said that he had something critical to tell the Investigators but the NPC drove Johnny away because he was getting too upset which was driving away customers. When the PCs finally get around to investigating Johnny they find only a bloodsmear and an old raggedy shoe under the bridge where Johnny spends every night. This gives the PCs a sense of urgency and they will be on edge until they figure out what is going on.Secondly I have found that the only obvious clues that should be left for PCs should be ones they have to work hardest to get. For your example a NPC might have seen Jane Janeson pickup something metallic and shiny off the ground at some important location. The PCs then might have to track Jane down across Arkham PCs might have to talk her down from attacking them when they find her or be attacked by her if they cannot and then get her to finally present the police badge that she found on the ground.Lastly I would recommend adopting a nonrigid structure for clues. Come up with clues that could theoretically be found in several places or situations like a creepy tree carved into the wall. Then as the PCs investigate if it seems like they are focusing on a particular place decide to move the tree carving to a secret room in the place the PCs are investigating. A successful check or two later and they have a clue even if it wasnt the original place you had planned on them finding it. This method allows you to be more flexible with clues and adventures instead of becoming frustrated because the players dont explore in the way that you expected them too. It also makes the game more interesting to the GM because it is always changing and never quite the way you planned it out and the players will be none the wiser to your methods. ,rpg,ddd6mvy,1,t5_2qh2s

10708389,0,t1_ddikzo5,Yeah I thought about that too.  Honestly it depends on the setting and what your players want to do.  Heres how I would work it . Not everyone in the party will be a mage  Then do what I suggested and combine all of the magic classes into one class. . Everyone IS going to be a mage and people dont need gems for minor magical effects  Then remove the magic classes as classes and have each player pick one for free.  Whenever someone gains a level then they automatically gain a level of the spellcasting class of their choice as if it were a series of racial traits in addition to their regular class level.  This would give everyone magic simplify deciding which attribute to use for spell casting and keep players from wasting levels.  Just keep in mind that some players will be getting magical abilities outside of their simple spell casting slots.  I dont know how you want to flavor that but it may just be necessary to let it slide. . Everyone IS going to be a mage and characters dont have magical abilities outside of spell casting  Remove the spell casting classes altogether and simply apply the Wizards spell casting chart to the remaining classes.

10723374,0,t1_ddm0nd1,gt I would argue that being the leader and the moral compass would involve making hard choices for it to remain interesting. Easy choices are not really choices are they? Were entering the territory governed by Sorites Paradox  what you think an easy choice doesnt have to be according to me and the other way around. Because of that yes I can agree that an easy choice might not be very entertaining but it doesnt mean were thinking about one and the same.That being said I dont think that a hard choice must immediately mean Paladin falls alignment shift OR an orphanage burns down alongside its innocent residents. Exchanging a family heirloom for a simple wooden raft thats gonna take you across the river makes a hard choice. Abandoning your horse or going back to get it  through goblin infested maze  isnt an easy choice. Using an illegally acquired information isnt easy either. Serving a harsh sometimes unjust but efficient general is damn challenging.Theres a plethora of possibilities and yet people go full extreme.gt Also OP never said that this is all that the characters story is about  they just wanted to share a moment in their story that they though was cool. And I expressed my inability to comprehend putting such extreme AFAIC solutions to work. I understand that some people might like it for me its weird.Dont look at me. The idea that everyone should be exactly the same and think the same is even weirder. gt A paladin tempted by evil or falling from grace is an often used trope certainly. But what you listed are also pretty standard stuff. If playing a paladin was just about seeking evil and fighting it and the evil was always clearly evil it would also be boring. Bashing a cliche for being a cliche isnt very productive if all you have to replace it is more cliches.Pretty much every critically acclaimed idea might be reduced to a simple and boring explanation along the lines of oh its just X but with a twist. It doesnt make it immediately either good or bad and certainly doesnt call for some extreme measures to keep people entertained and the story  alive.Is all about the execution of concept.,rpg,ddm1boh,0,t5_2qh2s

The horror works because a halfhuman creature is still frightening just dont have NPCs show up and go And thats why you shouldnt mix races!What makes something Lovecraftian horror or more generally cosmic horror is that we cant know whats really out there and if we did we wouldnt be able to cope. Look at Bloodborne. Thats a massively Lovecraftian story and doesnt espouse any bigoted views. Or Mass Effect a series thats about uniting across speciesgenderrace differences to stop a Lovecraftian force.You can tell a cosmic horror story without using Lovecrafts straight white protagonists because they arent the point and its worth noting that I cant think of any instances of the damsel in distress trope in the Mythos because men are just as fragile in the face of the cosmic unknown as women.The real theme of cosmic horror is that nobody can handle it.

That means we dont know the objective here but the formula remains true.gtI think the best way for me to convey this is by giving a series of scenarios which are all essentially the same in terms of mechanics but that you might for one reason or another disqualify from XP.

He instead put pedal to the metal and attempted to floor it through the hostile village.Im not sure why this is being presented as an obviously bad idea. I cant help wondering if this might be a case of the GM punishing players for what he sees as stupidity and not doing what he thinks is right. Now that may not be the case at all. It could be that the players not having the perfect knowledge of the GM did what seemed like the best thing to them and the GM had set up a situation without realising it would punish them for doing the kind of cinematic and heroic thing they have been trained by movies and previous games to think is a good idea. Maybe a discussion about expectations is in order. If the players werent happy they might also be thinking something was unfair and it might be worth addressing that. ,rpg,deiito5,19,t5_2qh2s

By all accounts it is an incredible challenge to maintain both a high level of strength AND a high level of endurance. Heres a random article I pulled up about the difference between fast and slowtwitch muscle fibers. It should be able to get you started on the right path.On the contrary Strength and Speed are immensely correlated. For instance if you look at Sprinters they tend to look a lot more like this than they look like this This is why in another thread I said to you that Speed has nothing to do with Dex and should instead be linked to Strength if it must be linked to anything.,rpg,deo2gsr,3,t5_2qh2s

11141717,0,t3_5z2rl4,Honestly the only three games I know of designed for this kind of thing are Trail of Cthulhu Call of Cthulhu and Silent Legions.Trail of Cthulhu youre familiar with but for the sake of anybody else reading uses the gumshoe system a fairly light system for running investigation heavy games.  Its generally a decent option.Call of Cthulhu is based on Basic Role Playing which in turn was based on the original RuneQuest game which in turn was heavily inspired by the original DampD.  There are a number of stats for which you roll d or in two cases d and usually assign in order there are a number of skills which are a percentile chance to pass a challenging skill check and you have few enough hit points that getting shot is a bad idea.  Almost every roll is a percentile roll it doesnt get much simpler than this.Silent Legions meanwhile is one of Kevin Crawfords sandbox games this one being intended for cosmic horror basically Lovecraft with the serial numbers filed off.  There are the standard six DampD stats which are d rolled in order after which you pick a class and may increase one of two stats based on your class to a  if they arent both there already.  Skill rolls are simple enough d  ability modifier  skill  if untrained combat has lower is better AC which may be a little confusing but ditches thac for target  d  bonuses  targets AC hit on a  or better.  This one isnt one Id normally suggest for one shots but again someone else might find it useful.,rpg,deuwhwf,1,t5_2qh2s

Starting with the result you want after x month of play will only lead to trouble.  It will make things harder for you and deny your players choice to a huge degree.The only way I could see using a flash forward mechanic would be for some global catastrophe something almost utterly unavoidable and as a portent  say a comet hitting the setting and use the prophetic dream of it as impetus for the PCs.Alternative you may be able to play like this in a system with shared narrative control but with e that is gonna be near impossible and seems likely not worth the effort for the result.,rpg,df7d8q2,2,t5_2qh2s

11335972,0,t3_61rzpl,Okay.. so here is my point of view for anyone looking into this kickstarter.BuyingFirst. Go for lower tiers. The Early Bird Gold is probably the best value followed by regular Gold. The higher up in tier you go the less worth it this becomes. Unless you  know for a fact you will use this at least constantly for the next  years Platin is not worth it. At minimum you will get  months of subscription out of the actual price you pay. The higher you go the less you get for your buck. Otherwise stick to lower tiers and come out ontop if this gets funded.To the DevsYour pricing and rewards for backing are asinine at higher tiers. I feel like either no thought was put into them or you have a clear lack of respect for the people you are asking to back your product. The higher your tiers go the less they are going to be worth. Youre asking people to invest using CAD for reference . for a lifetime license and almost nothing else. My next two issues are alphabeta access and the poster. The poster isnt an incentive if youre charging your backers to ship it. Your premium tiers going this high up should include the cost you take on to ship these out. Plus IDGAF about a poster. Less so when it costs me almost . to get it shipped. Even the high high tiers have nothing of value added outside of being in the game or having your stuff converted to physical form. However what is possibly the most concerning thing to me here is you are dividing testing time up between a larger group and a smaller group where the netyield is going to be less bugQOLchange reports which is going to result in a worse overall product. Shows a pretty distinct lack of respect to not only the TRPG fans but to the audience youre targeting who you know love this type of thing. What I would like to have seen were less poor reward choices for people to want to invest. Why Platin doesnt come with a Lifetime   free yr subscription code to give to someone or add something else of actual value related to the product youre pitching is beyond me. Overall I would tell people to grab any yr subscription if you are going to kickstart it. Otherwise just do the regular payment plan when it comes out. None of the higher tier stuff is worth it from a consumerinvestment standpoint. Iv had kickstarters give out duplicate copies for  less than the cost of the base pledge level yet the best that you seem to get here is a poster which you have to pay for anyways,rpg,dfgwv57,1,t5_2qh2s

11347401,0,t3_61we80,Im not going to say that railroad is straight up bad. Depending on your style of campaign it can be used well. This particular instance seems like it could be a cool situation even if the players dont have much agency. However there is a difference between a touch of railroad setting up things so the characters will be guided in a specific direction and a ton of railroad making the characters spectators while you tell the story.So yeah have God B show up in person or as a voice or whatever interact with the players and start up that storm. Let the players try to argue with god B even if it probably wont work. Let them try to save the boat or get away even if it probably wont work. God B is a god so you have some leeway. As long as you dont make an obvious railroad call but instead let everything derive from the fact that God B is a freaking god I think you should be okay with player agency. Sure the players couldnt change the situation but that was because they were up against a god not because of GM fiat.Though it also hinges on everything being cool. If the players are too wrapped up in this awesome situation then the railroad just glides by as they enjoy the ride. But if the players dont want to get involved with gods and just want to get on with the part of the game they find fun well.. then they might see God B as an obstacle placed personally by you the GM and completely unfair because they cant do anything about it.

11372225,0,t3_62a1dn,Ok I have some thoughts about your questions as well as some general feedbackadvice.I think for this worldstoryline the cult leader is not too much of a stretch.  Its sort of obvious however.  You could make the cult leader the obvious bad guy but really he turns out to be a good guy  and the big bad is the least obvious like the cult leaders innocent librarian secretary.Perhaps the company who manufactures mana harvesting tech is a good company trying to ultimately stop mana nova from ever happening by keeping mana levels at a controllable level through harvesting pockets of mana spikes or manasprings  like hot springs. They could be helping the cult because they dont actually know about the cult  they think they are supplying the town where the cult is they are not geographically close and the cult has forged some contracts and paperwork etc.This company could be bad however or owned by someone who just wants to make a ton of money.  I guess youd have to figure out how the cult has a lot of money then.Make the mana somehow tied to the ancients  like the mana is being produced by them in their dreamlike state.  Perhaps it actually protects them also.Ok  thoughtsobservations.  As a GM you might need to challenge yourself to look for ways to involve your players in the story.  It almost seems like you have written a complete story from beginning to end including developing the backstories for the main characters.  Ultimately it is not fun from a players perspective to be led around by the GM showcasing the world and story they have created without having any narrative control or input.

11393199,0,t3_62ilny,Another vote for Mythras or what used to be known as RuneQuest for a game in the realism camp. The Mythras Imperative is free and its protopredecessor Legend is dirt cheap if you want to spend as little money as possible.  Mythras is by itself tailored to classic swordampsorcery and historical settings. Other official supplemental options include Travelleresque SciFi and transdimensional steampunk.  The entire d BRPfamily belong in the realism camp but Mythras manages to get almost everything just right. For lighter options look at OpenQuest Magic World or for a DIY universal the core Basic RolePlaying Big Gold Book.  A big plus is that the compatibility between the different dgames is very high  to the point where running a scenario for one game like Call of Cthulhu or Stormbringer with another game like Mythras or Renaissance is close to trivial once you get your head around the fairly straightforward core mechanics.,rpg,dfneij0,3,t5_2qh2s

11415763,0,t3_62ui9s,Alright here are my major offenders from recent experiences. The joke Character guy. Everyone else came to play with a character that fits in the world. He sat down day of and made one up in the first half of the session names Coke McFanta because there were sodas on the table and he couldnt be arsed to come up with a name. Then he spends all of his time and effort coming up with asshole plans to screw with the party. Example We find an artefact of an ancient civilization that we have to use to save the world. He insists on carrying it because his race have ties to that civilization. He proceeds to light it on fire use it as a bedpan try to pawn it use it to go sledding down a hill etc all to get reactions out of our characters who are trying to halt the apocalypse because its funny for him personally.My Character wouldnt join the party. This guy will  of the time play some kind of brooding loner that ranges from floating on the periphery of the group to actively wasting time doing other things while the rest of us sit around with our thumbs in our asses while he knocks over a jewelry store while were meeting with the magistrate about the kobold raids in the mines.  of the time the only reason a party would adventure with this character is because his player happens to be in the room.I check out the treasure first and pocket the difference. Related to the first two this assbag will go off spelunking when hes supposed to be scouting or even when the party is in combat and will pocket anything he finds for resale later. Hey! A plustwo longbow marked with the ancient elven crest! I could give that to the guy playing the Elf Scout but nah. I can get enough to upgrade my armor if i sell it.   Thats what my character would do. They will generally be disruptive and horrible defending groping the princess at the royal ball or flipping the table at a negotiation as thats what my character would do except when you put them in a situation that calls for those actions but have personal risk to him. Im playing a cowboy who doesnt follow the rules! Come on were breaking out of this jail. No. Im gonna stay here I already called a lawyer.I cant do anything. This player goes into stunlock at the slightest hint of adversity and sits like a lump pouting for the rest of the game. They didnt find the first trap and it went off? They no longer open doors as the rogue and complain about it. Badguy has spell resistance and theyre playing a sorcerer? Theyre not gonna cast any spells and just pout about it. Badguy is hard to hit? Im just not gonna swing my sword anymore. Theyre a real wet blanket.i do that too. Everything you can do they can do too and theyre gonna. Rogue has  to stealth? He has a  hes gonna come too. Barbarian has a  to intimidate? He has a high charisma hes gonna intimidate that guy too. He can do everything you can do but nothing that his characters roll is supposed to do. He would have come in as the healer and refuse to cast healing spells because those slots could be used for spiritual hammer or something. He came as the spellcaster but didnt train in spellcraft or arcana so he actually cant tell you anything about magic in the game. You are the mighty Hercules and he is Newton always tagging along and thrusting himself into your area.The lump. No one knows why the lump comes. He shows no signs of interest or enjoyment in the game or the system he doesnt know how his character works even three months in he is a regular nocallnoshow and when he is there he is often on his phone dicking around. He never knows what numbers to add to his dice or what dice to roll. He is the pizza burn on the roof to the groups mouth  annoying but never bad enough to get the boot. In my experience this person is a sibling or roommate of one of the other players.The asshole player. This guy always had to win at the game and it was not enough that he win others must lose. He would find the module and read ahead so he is tailor made to be the best at it. He would spend his time in the rulebooks to undermine things other peoples characters were doing. He actually owns weighted dice. He wont leave his character sheet witht he DM because reasons. He will often have some kind of rolling box thats difficult to see from across the table and thus will lie about dice numbers. If he gets called out on any of this he will throw a fit and at best case pout. At worst case hell leave probably midcombat but still come back next week and expect everyone to act like nothign happened. Phew. That was pretty cathartic.,rpg,dfpyrh4,3,t5_2qh2s

The Call of Cthulhu games and derivatives are known for some high quality adventures. Masks of Nyarlathotep is a standout and forms quite a long campaign but there are modules of all length. I have a special love for the published adventures for The Laundry Files but then I love the novels. CoC modules typically have documents to be handed out to players and that is just great nothing like being able to hand over a physical thing for players to pour over when investigating.Numenera has some interesting stuff put out for it. Specifically check out Weird Discoveries its a collection of  single session adventures designed specifically to be run with minimal prep.Also check out some of the classic DampD adventures from the TSR era. They cover a broad range of styles and allow you to see what works and what doesnt. Especially worth checking out is T The Village of Hommlet which outlines a small community which can serve as a home base for a party of nobodies. The A series that uses largely basic and low power enemies to challenge players as they gain levels with tactics rather than just making the enemies more powerful. The GDQ series that is considered to contain some of the best modules from the era. Also of note are the S series S Tomb of Horrors is a puzzle and trap orientated dungeon designed to challenge and confound experienced players and S Expedition to the Barrier Peaks which blends science fiction elements into a fantasy world with a very interesting style making sure to describe what the characters are seeing only in terms they would understand.,rpg,dfxjvct,2,t5_2qh2s
11483967,0,t1_dfxo3ue,Oh for sure. The core mechanic has the players roll   or d and add their skill rank to the highest result.  or higher is complete success. Partial success and Disaster is determined by the characters stress score. If any dice roll a  the character gains stress equal to the amount of dice they rolled. Stress is also gained from other activities like starting a fire. And stress can be removed by eating relaxing etc.As for combat the players have  dice per turn and once a die is rolled it cant be rolled again until they regain it which happens at set points in combat. So players have to balance how many dice they attack or move with and how many they keep for defending. Top that off with a very simple body injury system and blood loss mechanics. I know that sounds like a lot of bookkeeping or charts but I went through great effort to avoid both. Its all in front of the player and the only math youll have to do is subtracting armor from damage and adding any blood loss.,rpg,dfxpf3v,10,t5_2qh2s

11540644,0,t1_dg3vxgr,Basically what uTathas said. I dont run Mythras straight up because I dont like the combat system. I hear it gets better the more you run it. Its a good system but its just too heavy for what Im looking for. If youre in my boat look up Magic World. It runs off the same system Basic Roleplaying but combat is lighter and more cinematic. Think Jedi lightsaber duels. When the odds are even there can be lots of swing  parry until someone fails a roll or a special  critical is rolled. Better yet the magic systems from Mythras drop right in just ignore bits about hit locations and make some minor tweaks to certain spells so you can still have the best of both worlds.In Magic World health is done in large pools without the fiddlyness of hit locations if youre not looking for that level of simulation. It does use a wounding system though to give you access to the same lethality and make it so health pools arent a long slog. If you take a major wound a single attack over half your HP you need to roll on a table that determines any extra wounds you take and you can only stay conscious for  a a number of rounds equal to your remaining HP as  a you go into shock. Most combats with average humans end in one to three blows. Last time we played we had the PCs ambush some goblins and one of the players had a bow. He shot and hit a goblin in round one doing  points of damage to an  HP goblin. The goblin took a major wound and rolled on the table getting additional muscle damage. It lost d strength. He shot at another one next round hitting it for  HP. This one rolled poorly and received a shot to the leg severely hamstringing it and losing d dexterity. The last goblin was tackled and wrestled to the ground by the rest of the party and the two goblins who were shot fell unconscious before they could flee much further. Combat lasted four rounds.To make it so combats arent always parry fests there are also standard rules for breaking weapons which is easier to do with two handed weapons and certain spells. A big bruiser with a big weapon can actually hack through an opponents weapon or shield eventually. The combat is fantastic  you can actually hear the air go from the room every time a PC fails a roll and I love it.I prefer Magic World because I feel it lends itself better to dark fantasy its a remake of the old Elric  Stormbringer RPG if youre familiar with those stories and feels more cinematic and has some other BRP rules I prefer over Mythras I like resistance charts skills over  and dislike hit locations. Its also more streamlined. If youre looking for something simple and easy to run check out Magic World. If youre looking for more realism go Mythras.,rpg,dg44tuj,3,t5_2qh2s

11567698,0,t1_dg4zbbb,This is definitely unequivocally wrong.It isnt just nitpicking either  it is wrong in precisely the sense that it fails to show how an unequal ratio can be magnified when other factors are taken into account. The part that purports to show that is exactly the part of it thats wrong.This is an extremely common kind of statistical mistake.If you have  players and  of them are female the chance that a given player is female is . the ratio of female players to the population. You calculate this correctly.If we say that  in  of those players aspire to be game designers that doesnt change the ratio. You calculated this correctly too on average  in  aspiring game designers will be female the same proportion as the population youre randomly sampling from.If you then rank those five people at random theres a  chance that the woman will be ranked the highest which again you calculate correctly.And thats it. Thats your answer. Theres no more multiplying to be done. No matter how many times you repeat this process each group will on average have one woman and four men and each will have a  chance that the woman will be ranked the highest  on average  of the game designers will be women because  of the groups will end up with a woman ranked highest.Its the same answer you arrived at in the paragraph before the mistake so perhaps you can see evidence of the mistake in the contradiction between your paragraphs first you say  out of  times the woman is not the best candidate for the job so  out of  times  the woman is the best candidate for the job and in the next paragraph you say the chance of a female being the best candidate for the job is.... It cant be both  and . Edit In case youre tempted to say  out of  times the woman is not the best candidate for the job and the chance of a female being the best candidate for the job are not the same thing think about rolling a die.  out of  times that you roll a die youll get an odd number. The chance of rolling an odd number is   out of . Theyre the same thing. And this holds true no matter how many times you roll the die.You can try it yourself if you want to prove it to yourself. Grab a bunch of white dice and a few black dice and make the pool  black dice if you dont have a bunch of dice laying around anything else will do so long as it looks different but feels the same with your eyes closed. Close your eyes then scramble them around and pick up five random dice from the pool. Open your eyes and write down the results repeat and youll see that on average your  dice have  black die and  white dice. Next do the same thing but after picking the five dice close your eyes again scramble those five dice and arrange them in a line then take the first one. Repeat these two steps scrambling the dice and picking  scrambling the  arranging them in a line and taking the first one and keep track of which color die you end up with. After a while youll see that  of the dice you end up with are black.If you take a random sample the proportion in the sample is on average the same as the proportion in the population. If you then sample from that sample which is what youre doing when you assign talent randomly rank by talent then take the top one  thats the same thing as just taking a random sample of  you again get on average the same proportion as the population that sample is from which was again the same as in the population it was drawn from.

Dont let a player make a bad decision based on a misunderstanding of the description of the world. If it would be obvious to the characters make sure its clear to the players and not misunderstood.

He could barely keep himself on track when we werent asking him to do much more than pay attention so GMing wasnt going to be an option for him. But the others? Once you grasp the basics of most systems all you really need to do is have the discipline to sit down and read the more nuanced rules and then decide if you want to use them. My suggestion ultimately is that you need to sit down with the players express where your head is at and make sure they know you feel like you may have burnt them out. Ask for feedback offer to let someone else drive for a while etc. Dont guilt trip or be too aggressive but let them know that youd really like the chance to play again and would be willing to help someone step up to the plate and GM in whatever system they feel most comfortable with.

Seriously monster manuals from other systems can be a huge help here.  Just ignore the stats provided.A few Id recommend The Pathfinder Bestiaries.  Cheap especially if you just want PDFs and they have a ton of content.  Every book includes something like  monsters.  They detail general behavior of the monsters what they generally look like attack patterns etc.  Great resource. The th Age Bestiary and the Midgard Bestiary for the th Age.  These are everything the Pathfinder Bestiaries are in spades with a lot more detail about the individual monsters. Numenera Bestiary.  It sounds like youll need a lot of strange beasts.  This book is perfect for that. DampD E Bestiaries.  These are excellent as well.  For what youre doing Id argue these are significantly better than any of the other DampD bestiaries.If you just need advice on how to write them so they have more character...honestly thats just an issue of practice.  Write write and write some more.  And read.  Lots of reading.I will say this though the big thing to understand is that beasts still have desires and goals.  Things they want.  They also have feelings fear and anger being the two most likely to come up in your sessions.How does a creature react when it desperately wantsneeds something and youre denying it to them?  Hows a creature going to act when protecting its young that you dont know is there?  Its going to keep its back to its young and try and keep itself between you and its young.  Its going to be defensive not offensive.  It wants you to go more than anything.When creating creatures start with its wants desires and feelings about the situation.  Why is this creature here what does it want and how does it feel about the current situation.,rpg,dgsstg1,2,t5_2qh2s

Thats no longer the case in e. Sure there are some ways to oneshot opponents on your first turn if youre fastert than them and utilize the right charm combos but the system doesnt demant it anymore and isnt broken enough to be accidentally lethal. ,rpg,dgv3775,2,t5_2qh2s

11784726,0,t1_dgvds82,I will say the Dragonborn Im looking for are specifically the ones from the .e manual Races of the Dragon. They are a unique race made so by Bahamut himself from willing members of other races. Every DoB used to be a member of a different race.,rpg,dgvu5oy,1,t5_2qh2s
11788247,0,t3_686vvf,The absolute bangbuck would have to be Savage Worlds Deluxe Explores Edition at . cover price. Theres so much game in that single book and youve got . left over to add on genre specific stuff to help you learn how they use the system to do just about anything. RippersDeadlandsSavage Rifts... Theres so much out there to cover so many different things.The Cypher System Rulebook is fantastic as well. Im a big fan of how easy it is to run and character creation is interesting. The core CSR has a lot more genretweaking aid in the main rulebook but its a lot heavier on the price but still well within your budget. You could score this and the new Expanded Worlds book and play just about anything you can imagine. If you want to be more specific Numenera and The Strange both run off this system and have fully established settings.Last but not least Id dig into a few different PbtA books AWnd Masks and Dungeon World should cover the main genres and should come in under the  wire while showing you three very different ways to use the engine to make the magic happen.I always lean toward setting neutral systems if I want the most for my money. Theres a near infinite amount of setting info out there for free on the internet on your bookshelf and in the library. You just need the imagination to hang it on the skeleton that is the rules. ,rpg,dgw8ju0,23,t5_2qh2s
11792795,0,t3_689dly,The math is objective opinions on the results of the math are subjective.  For me personally Ill keep the d.One of the troubles I have with d is that with a d all your bonuses are flat  but by adding a d to a pool or by changing your target number to  a  instead of a  your simple  bonus starts out providing closer to a  bonus to the activity which bleeds off with additional bonuses... From a math standpoint that provides a realistic feeling bell curve but from a gaming standpoint it reduces the number of moments that a truly difficult thing isnt truly difficult while making things that arent very difficult so common theyre almost not worth rolling for.  I prefer the swinginess of the d so that its just as likely that an amazing thing will go well as it is a simple thing wont go well.  Unpredictability is a big part of the fun at the table for me.,rpg,dgwr4dh,5,t5_2qh2s
