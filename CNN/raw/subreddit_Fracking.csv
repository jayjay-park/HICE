344028,0,t1_cfgell0,Honestly Im interested in all of the operators in Pennsylvania. Im trying to get a sense of how invested different firms are in fracking. Ive seen a couple of private firms that are selling this type of data but its way out of my price range lease and not well formatted. ,Fracking,cfgfeqo,1,t5_2udk6

That being said hydronic fracturing has yet to contaminate any major water supplies in and of itself. Methane not a chemical found in the solution of fracking chemicals has been found in many of our water wells for hundreds of years. In fact right down the road in Dimmock PA people have for years been able to light a match under their faucet and start a fire. I know this because my girlfriend is actually from Dimmock even from the infamous Carter road that so many antifracking activistslunatics rally behind and that was the trick that her grandfather would always show her years before anyone had heard of fracking. Failing to see the logic behind using to natural gas more is what baffles me the most natural gas burns cleaner and more efficiently than petroleum products yet tree jiggers would rather burn gas than help the environment at least a little until alternative transportation methods became more practical. Electric cars are a great idea except most electric is made through burning coal is that really helping? My point is the media has thoroughly blown out of proportion taken anything and everything out of context and blatantly lied to the American people for years about fracking yet the sheeple who apparently have never openmindedly thought about what they were listening to just keep sucking it up and fueling the fire. Locally without any issues  the economy has strengthened twofold people are happier the roads are paved and there are new businesses popping up everywhere. Wouldnt those effects be awesome spread a crossed the country where the terribly underreported .whatever unemployment rate has a vice on the balls of the everyday American? ,Fracking,cn19da1,0,t5_2udk6
