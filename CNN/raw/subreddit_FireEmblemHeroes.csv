Right now the game is in a very young phase so its hard to pinpoint exactly what direction the game or the community are going to go but I also think that if we do eventually get exceptionally challenging content that requires strategic asspulls we should be able to celebrate our completion of them ifwhen theyre beyond the usual scope.

10600613,0,t1_dd9d4es,Its a weird balance.For me I think most games hard cap stamina or at least gate it with required money transaction because they know that there are people that will grind it into the dirt instantly if they can and thats nearly all of the appeal of these games the treadmill aspect.I think its fairly shortsighted of whichever studio was responsible to let it go but then again this might just be representative of Nintendos general posture towards their presence in mobile games. Nintendos never really been the one to be cognizant of the market around them so I guess in some respect this shouldnt come as much of one either.I think the thing that stuck out to me is that I cant even really say I put in effort to progress as far as I did in Heroes. I just turned on auto battle and went back to modeling in Maya pausing every now and then to cycle a level up screen or a new mission.And thats one of the things that kinda gets me the most. Their difficulty curve ramps down when youd expect it to be rising save for a couple of spikes in chapter .

10624207,0,t1_ddbrxl2,Yeah. Id recommend it. Theyre also doing a short versions of the events last year for the new players joining in.Story mode is actually fleshed out the events can be grindy but some of them are also quite fun there was one where you got to build a summer village of your own or if youre fan of their other animes the collabs events were fun for the fans and the gameplay is like classic RPG and balanced enough that you dont even need super rare servantsCommunity is fun.The gatcha itself can be a bit harsh feeling and there are limitedtime servants that only comes every once in a blue moon. But again theyre not necessary and since its gambling its pretty anecdotal and depends on how lucky you are. A friend of mine has ? ? SSR highest rarity units without ever having spent a dime.Ive spent around  bucks on the game and have around . So not a big difference.,FireEmblemHeroes,ddbt0zb,1,t5_3imv0
10624513,0,t3_5rxs4m,One thing I didnt realize until way too long was that the weapon triangle applies when using magic to fight physical weapons and vice versa. This was not the case in the old FE games I played but now that I realized this it makes the game that much easier. So thats one thing to keep in mind. FE Heroes is even more RockPaperScissors reliant than its traditional counterparts especially with abilities like Triangle Effectiveness or weapons like Sapphire LanceRuby Sword. Due to the small map sizes and the limited effect that terrain plays herethe only effect Ive noticed is that certain units cant pass by certain terrain otherwise terrain doesnt affect damage defense avoid etctheres a lot less strategy involved as it relates to positioning. Not having a preparation phase kinda sucks too. I think overall youre right in that stats play a greater role than does strategy.At the same time though theres a lot less luck involved in this game because there are no criticals and theres no hit and miss chance. I dont know about you but thats huge to me I cant count the amount of times I had to restart a scenario due to dumb luck resulting in Guy or Fir or Raven or someone dying to an archer with a  critical chance or something stupid like that. So I think I disagree somewhat when you say that you can beat anything with strategic thinking in the old FE games. RNG played just as much a role in that game as did strategy. ,FireEmblemHeroes,ddbu5sh,2,t5_3imv0

Name Seriously why is takumi everywhere?Unit  Sheena    GreenGeneral  Unit  Cordelia    BluePegasus Knight  Unit  Roy    RedPrince  Unit  Serra    ColorlessPriestress  This is a team I used for Arena battle this season. Beforehead I used Robin since he is the bonus character this season but he is only  stars so I picked Roy as an alternative and answers for Hector. This team consist a Tank a DPS a subDPS and a Healer. Cordelia with her brave lance is basically the only character that can one shot any enemy in my team. In a Arena full of red weapon princeprincess she is able to take some shot and finish themoff. The only problem she encounters is Takumi.Sheena is an amazing Tank. Although she cant do much damage like some crazies out there and can be take down easily by prince she can be a serious wall with her special ability which neturalize the effective against specility and in end game it can easily chase mage and others down. Takumi can take  of her health in one round though. Roy is better because he is a red weapon user Which is a effective answer to Hector and he can push Sheena around make her more mobile which I liked a lot. At level  he can also deal some damage to all  star unlike my poor  star Robin.Seera is the best healer in my hand. Her ability to heal  per time is simply amazing. She can also deal some damage as a mage.We got all weapons there. everybody could survive a hit and getting heal back. Also fun to play. Except against Takumi Seriously what wrong with this god damn punk.If not for the bonus I might swap Roy out for Setsuna to just deal with Takumi.So far I got  points  win with hard and  win with normal and ranked in .

Or it just wouldnt be possible to continue your streak after failure like it is now.Regardless what your idea does is make it so that one sword is worth seven times as much as it used to be worth which is a lot.

If that doesnt happen then we can assume its working as intended and then those folks can show Nintendo their distaste of it by no longer giving them their patronage. Either way the games new and almost all roads lead to revamps. Lets just hope for the best on that front.,FireEmblemHeroes,ddhr1gf,0,t5_3imv0

10765884,0,t1_ddp9zqr,Not entirely true.  Most games arent much different with the exception that your Stamina increases with player leveling.  You must also keep in mind that this game isnt even a month old.  Nintendo will certainly add more content and like the arena it may not even cost stamina to play OR the stamina costs might be lower.  So it may only be  minutes of game play in Story Mode on Lunatic or at the toptier of training but that would also be offset by special quests and possibly friendevents that might use other currency or fewer stamina points.,FireEmblemHeroes,ddqf67h,1,t5_3imv0

10790390,0,t1_ddsv668,Still a ridiculous argument. Your suppositions are incorrect. It does not take k feathers to have a competent Sharena. It takes about k feathers. Or one week of arena with basically ANY team. And a few hours of tower. After shes  she takes exactly as much effort to get to  as any other good  you mightve pulled. But heres the point. You DONT have to pull her. Not everyone has pulled a  star Robin Effie or even Abel. And certainly not everyone has pulled a top tier  blue. Which again makes her FREE. And the level of investment youre implying is wildly overstated as it would be as much to get her from  as those others Ive mentioned and she can be just as important to many comps as any of those heroes if not more so. I dont know why Im even engaging you here. Youre talking about something entirely different whether shes worth the investment. Thats not the point I made. The point is EVERYBODY GETS HER. Thats it. Youre turning it into something else. And read above as Ive already explained why she takes a tenth of the resources youre talking about to get her to the level of pulling a competent  star blue which AGAIN you dont have to do with Sharena.

Kagerou and Takumi overlap but both are very strong so if you dont have a ton of other damage dealers the overlap can be ok.  Although Kagerou has trouble with noninfantry Takumi should be able to pick up the slack and Kagerou is a good counter for sword lords like Lucina who will kill your Nowi.  If you go that way though your team will have issues with strong defensive characters like Hector Takumi loses v Nowi is blue vs. his green Kagerou cant get through his defense so a strong mage would be a good addition if you have one.Its a bit tough without knowing what youve pulled.,FireEmblemHeroes,ddt8asl,1,t5_3imv0

Ephraims not toptier. That I said already. But theres a difference between saying Ephraims not toptier and how bad hes making Ephraim out to be. I just went up against someone who had two Lucinas and a Chrom at level  when my Ephraim is . He suffered less than  damage in total killing all of them. If used right he at least will kill a red and a blue. Thats just not a bad character by any stretch of the imagination.Thats just it though. IF you get Ephraim and youre lacking in blues hes fine. But in that case you should be rolling the gacha regardless because you need a quality blue. Im trying to make the distinction between saying Dont USE Ephraim even if hes your only blue option bad advice and saying Dont ROLL hoping for Ephraim roll if you need a blue consider stopping if you get a decent  star good advice.Thats all.

10816768,0,t1_ddvjhc3,Not really a matchup prediction type of thing. More like have not had a really good nuke. Julia is decent but she really needed speed or  attack to ve perfect. She nearly  shots takumi but will die from him doubling. Takumi is relatively average in speed in the meta so he rarely doubles unless next to lynn. Lynn is super squishy and thus pretty much only for killing blows and speed support. Ephraim is a beast but once again just short of  shotting most things. He replaced my speed takumi my second oneWhen you mostly face red lords and takumis not really sure how you kill more than  a turn unless you let them attack first which does not work out too well with a slower party.

10819499,0,t3_5upovn,Nice post. Glad you got your waifu up to max.I was surprised at how balanced her stats are numerically. The wiki and IV calculator suggest you got unfortunate with a Atk and Spd for Def and Res nature so shed normally have a serviceable  Atk and  Spd.I think the most interesting comparison is her with Roy who has surprisingly similar stats and skills. On average Selena has higher Speed and Defense while Roy has higher HP and Attack especially with Binding Blade having  more might than Selenas Armoslayer. So Selena is better at killing armors but Roy is more well rounded. Her Threaten Speed seems better than Roys Seal Defense and Reposition has a  tile advantage over Shove as a movement option. So while the lack of power against the general crowd hurts she seems versatile enough to handle standard A and B tier characters and dont think that warrants her current position as worst sword unit in the game.You dont really need to worry about tier lists to use the character you like. And even if you do I dont think shell be bottom tier for long.,FireEmblemHeroes,ddvye3l,11,t5_3imv0

10864534,0,t1_de0lfyw,I would consider keeping Effie as a tank in place of Emphraim in case your team needs one. On the other hand Emphraim does a considerable amount of damage... I guess it would depend on how your tests come out. I dont have LucinaEmphraimEirika myself so its all theorycraft based on fighting against them in Arena. Effie is very immobile though so if you dont find a need for a tank then drop her by all means. Usually you need to have Nino Pull Back on Effie turn  for her to get to the front in time which requires the game actually placing the two units in starting positions where this can happen. From my experiences leveling up EffieNino together this is more frustrating than not. The main reason I suggested Effie is Im not sure how you would deal with Takumi without her Smite  movement if you are having problems.,FireEmblemHeroes,de0llnf,1,t5_3imv0

10866391,0,t1_de0s8kc,Well if you dont play any arena at all and dont send any unit home you get  feathers per month with a full friend list. If you dont have any friends at all this cuts down to a whooping  feathers lol. The thing is even WITH arena it takes a really long time to upgrade a single unit to  stars. I know some of the people here like it and say yeah well theyre supposed to be rare you know but that doesnt change the fact that it just takes a really fucking long time. Right now if you roll a good star unit like Nowi or Effie you can pretty much say oh might as well use her in  months shame I didnt get a star. Theres something wrong with a gacha game when all you care about is the absolute highest rarity and everything below is meh. In every other gacha game I played you could farm a promotion in a reasonable timeframe ranging from a couple hours to a few days. The arena is already infested with whales so much that I face fucking Hector in nearly  of my matches even though he wasnt even a focus unit yet. If IS doesnt provide good ways to farm feathers in the near future this will only get worse.

All you need is a hone attack and youll be able to oneshot every nongreen unit in the game except for Ephraim Donnel Ephraim and Gwendolyn. And youll still oneround Ephraim Donnel and Gwenyoull just eat a counterattack doing so. All this comes to show that speed is irrelevant for her. You dont need speed for defense since shes not a defensive unit. If youre expecting her to tank any nonred hits youre using her wrong.Without Brave Lance shes shit.

Things like Kagero or Cecille have to get hit by him first before being able to kill him on the next turn albeit being left with very low HP afterwards. Robin pretty much doesnt give a damn about him. Setsuna would also destroy him although she doesnt come as a  and promoting her only for Takumer seems like a bad investment.

Most of the time best strategy is to let them come to you while your units stay together sticking buffs not going out of your way to kill someone risking being killed first. Being cavalry in arena isnt that big of a deal due to forest map and fliers are generally better for flanking.Ryoma is better because his stats is a lot better than Xander. He has better speed and attack which means he rarely gets double. Normal linde cant  turn him is an example while Xander would definitely die. Hone Speed is also better than Spur Def because many allies can get TKO range with a speed buff i.e Takumi.Distant Counter got really overrated in this sub because many people dont know how to counter TakumiHector in Defense while in offense most of the time DistantClose Counter doesnt really matter that much because its a  shot fest,FireEmblemHeroes,de7by0e,10,t5_3imv0

He is very tanky when he goes against takumi if takumi hits him first he can hit back and then finish him off on your turn without dying. Same cant be said about a lot of other mages. He also counters flying and blue of course anytime you have a unit that counters two thingslike lucina and robin it covers up a lot of ur weaknesses. His weakness is the lack of resistance and crappy special. But since you have a great front line in effie he can just hide behind the back.

10966078,0,t1_deb0pco,Your Sharena is also  star but doesnt get her best support power until  star with her weapon and final defense buff skill. Meanwhile Nowi functions great with her magical damage counter utility and Threaten Res which can help her out and Robin. If both were at  star Id have a hard time choosing between the two. Regardless you still have Eirika to support already. Olivias really dependent on who she refreshes and if they can muscle through an opponent and stay safe. Takumis great maybe Lyn but thats about itnone of your team is really geared towards absolutely wrecking the opponent twice over like Lucina Linde Nino etc. and staying safe.  NinoOliviaSharena or Eirika would work great together for a Nino team. It should be mentioned that Olivia at  stars will lower your stat totals so fewer  arena points and K feathers doesnt really give her that much more oomph for such a large investment. Lyn starts getting her power once shes below half health but survivability is the name of the game in the arena. I figured Eirika would be more flexible between support and attack. Reinhardt has a low base stat total and crippling speed. Hes not terrible but Robin fulfills the role of blue mage better has advantage against colorless and can tank a hit without getting doubledand possibly doubling in turn with support thanks to Eirikas speed buff and Takumis Threaten Speed. Robin also provides a  Def buff so whoever hes hiding behind can take a hit better. ,FireEmblemHeroes,deb2nug,1,t5_3imv0

10972744,0,t1_debq30s,So in the end I dont really think that someone who uses mods to max out their units cant go back to playing this game normally again as heshe would have enough units maxed to be able to survive the postgame content. But perhaps some would feel so and they would quit. True.WhalesSpenders would feel like wasting their money when i saw that one thread where someone spent k for average  units and one  Camille and eventually quit because of frustration.Many FP people would tend to turn slowly but eventually into mod users too. Everyone wants to be as lazy as possible. To do the most efficient thing in a given time i guess. E.g. me as a FP i feel somehow very demotivated if i know that i spend a few hours a day leveling up my units when others snap their fingers and instantly max something out which i dont really see the meaning of since you dont really have a sense of accomplishment when modding these stats while i micro my units using my precious time which i could spend on studying for exams. If you know what i mean To sum it up...somehowI agree with you. If this doesnt get fixed soon this game is done before releasing game changing and fun bringing features.I dont know if making everything serversided would be a possible solution tho this would give us long ass loading time...Atleast and LUCKILY feathers and orbs are.Edited Actually nevermind only orbs are.

Its important as consumers to hold a companys feet to the fire when they mess up or when the user experience turns into something you dislike  but its also important to remember that solutions take time technical limitations are a thing and its very difficult to just flip the script on whats handled client side versus server side.

11019978,0,t1_deh1vqb,Thats it. Im done with you. You exist solely to regurgitate everything youve said before without offering any new input so Ill respond one final time.No I am not saying that every nonprotagonist has to be  dimensional. More often than naught though they are with the good stories having characters who have  dimensional traits being fleshed out for realism Aka what Fire Emblem usually does and even did with some characters in Awakening and Fates despite what your insane tunnel vision leads you to believe. Also Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show primarily known for its tremendously trashy characters and story plot. Honestly this lost you a lot of credibility as a person who cares about story and character design.Whats wrong with a jokish character? Comic relief exists in the real world too its called comedians andor morale boosters. Arthur is basically that. And hes a wonderfully done version of that. So you can fuck straight off if you think hes a dud character. And Elise is not just little sister fodder. If you want a good example of that play FE where Tiki is moreso like that. Telling someone what they like is wrong is belittling someone. Its telling them Oh you can have your opinion just know its inferior and you have the brain of a dead skunk for thinking it. This is how you sound and you dont even realize it. We get it you passionately despise these characters stop being a piece of shit about it.EVERY FEMALE CAN BE A WAIFU YOU DENSE SHIT. A waifu is a female character a person has affection for based around their design both appearance and personality wise. You act like everyone who has a waifu likes them solely based off looks. Believe it or not real people are not usually that  dimensional either.Youve never even heard of morale have you? She doesnt wish to kill anyone. None of them do! Thats the entire fucking point of the plot to show that they dont have dreams of conquest like their corrupted douchebag of a dad. I dont give a shit how Birthright portrayed Elise to you because of course it fucking portrayed them as bad people to the people of Birthright they were! People say they like Takumi so much and hes the biggest piece of shit alive even when you side with him he takes ages to finally accept that you arent a backstabbing asshole. And of fucking course you have no issue with the one genuine easily understandable problem of Fates the introduction of children in a game that held no relevance to the plot. Not every fucking character is a harem character I dont give a shit how much your retarded brain cant see that. But you dont either. Youre gonna go on and on about how design and not being caked in armor is ruining the integrity of a character and that if each character doesnt have a god damn light novel explaining their relevance backstory and what they eat for dinner every night you wont like them. Fuck off. You are nothing but a god damn instigator at this point picking fights over stupid shit because you dont like it. Know what now I hope the next game IS like Fates so asshats like you can just bother another series with your constant whining.Now then thank you for being the receptor of my anger cause now I can go on my merry way not fucking ever talking to your stupid ass again,FireEmblemHeroes,deh316l,6,t5_3imv0

Then its a matter of very careful sniping of the armoured knight with the Robins while keeping them out of range of the ninja using Olivias dance only  Robin can attack each round and then Olivia dances them back to safety on the far left of the map. Then after the armoured knight is down send Frederick up to whack the top ninja and finish him off with M!Robin. Draw back use M!Robin to kill the red calvary and he tanks one hit from the bottom ninja. Draw back again and let Frederick tank the bottom ninja with the help of M!Robins defense boost. Finally kill the last ninja with a combination of Frederick and either Robin. Everyone had like lt health left by the time of the battle but just barely scraped through!

11116723,0,t3_5ylr08, Caeda   Olivia  Nino   PeriI baited the AI into doing dumb things with drawback and reciprocal aid by intentionally letting Ursula survive her first encounter with Nino by not speeding Nino to double attack range to let Nino kill everything except one ninja which Peri tanked up in the top corner to charge her special for a shot to end it. I tanked  turns due to being speed but  should be enough. Neutral Olivia survived with  HP after taking splash damage then tanking and crippling the Cavalier. Caeda only buffed people but she can survive some ninja stars and not get doubled. Nino got a quadra but I think with Peri not being Glimmery you could dance Nino on the last turn instead to give her the Penta!I think a lot of horses would be able to substitute for Peri she really only has to tank one round of ninja and be able to round or weaken it for Nino at the end Im pretty sure.

We cant fix Robins speed but we can make him hit harder with triangle adept. Since he has WTA on reds and colorless from his weapon he is actually one of the few units that can benefit greatly from adept doing  increased dmg to colorless and reds. The extra damage boost on adept is just enough for him to one round some reds and takumi which is nice. Quick riposte is there so he can double when attacked by ranged units above  hp. Unfortunately adept means greens will one shot him even harder but the benefit it brings more dmg to colorless and reds out weigh that con. ,FireEmblemHeroes,detckha,1,t5_3imv0

Im pretty sure that SPDRES is her ideal nature. DEF is substantially worse than RES because of aforementioned killedbyTakumi problem. DEF is better against Klein as expected since he carries a Brave weapon but youre forgetting Deathblow. Klein initiating on Linde even if he is ATK  base   on intiate and Linde is DEF  will still kill her. Id rather split the difference and pick up the extra effective health versus enemy Blue Mages while still being able to check Takumi who is far far more common than Klein on defending teams.

Growths have set values so certain units have a higher chance of getting a certain stat on level up. For example Sain has a  strength growth which will let him reach his cap very quickly.IVs just add another layer of gacha to the game. Dont get me wrong I like the game but they just dont add anything constructive to the arena. It penalizes those that arent rerolling or arent spending money since they cant get the best IVs possible unless theyre very lucky.Also I dont mean to nitpick but you got the cavaliers mixed up. Sain has high strength and defense while Kent has higher speed and skill.,FireEmblemHeroes,df080mw,2,t5_3imv0

Just let the AI come towards you and Est will shot most of the blues and all the reds while Cherche shot most of the greens and all the blues. So you could possibly kill all  units in  turn with the  dancers.CharacterBoonBane|Base Atk  Weapon|With Death Blow |With Hone Attack |Total|With Skill up Which gets added after all calculations|||||EstAtk not Res|||||ChercheAtk not Def|||||Neutral attack Cherche can even kill Fury  LucinaDef with her skill up and Hone Attack and your skill goes off on the nd person you attack.Hector can survive Cherche and Draug might survive Est but shouldnt be killing them back.Edit Should mention if it wasnt obvious you cant get the bonus score in Arena unless one of them are bonus. Can always try with tiny replacements Est  CordeliaHinokaEphaimDonnel Cherce  BartreFrederickRaven Dancers can be any dancer Could try only  of the Brave fliers and Dancers and  others but might be harder to win with no deaths.

11202865,0,t3_5zvdoz,Im fp and my rank in arena is currently .Actually skill inheritance made it easier to counter  guys since you can go for hardcounters like breakers slap fury on people get buffs for the team. Since this game is about baiting and abusing AI skill inheritance works in fp players favour because it gives them more tactical options. I can now get top tier places in arena without frustrating over whales I absolutely couldnt hardcounter before the patch. I also think skill inheritance is quite balanced since distantclose counter skills leave such units out of fury which in turn leaves the ability for player to catch up in stats. Every socalled broken build is going to have perfectly viable hardcounter. Theres also a pack of nice skills on completely free units.The last stratum missions are perfectly doable by fp players. We have free Gunter who gives amazing Hone Cavalry so anyone who tried to keep diverse cast and tinker with all unit type  teams should be able to do these missions. Theyre a challenge but thats what theyre for. Im not interested in breezing thorugh everything and these last stratum missions are going to bring actual enjoyment for me since I have to plan both startegically which units to bring forward and tactically. Its awesome. It is the very thing tht hardcore fire emblem veterans like me want. ,FireEmblemHeroes,df1twh8,1,t5_3imv0

11205493,0,t3_5zxhfs,I have k feather and Im so unsure on what to do.    Initially I wanted to upgrade my Nowi to  Star but I already have Linde Spd IV Ephraim Spd IV Effie Spd nature Cordelia and Hinoka for the blues so it sounds pretty overkill to AGAIN get another Star blue unit. My green slot is covered by Hector and my red is usually Eirika but now I have no idea what to do with those k Feathers. All my neutral are garbage tiers no archers and only ninja is Saizo and all other reds I have are mediocre and works better as Skill food Hinata  Lonqu.    So I was wondering if you guys had any cool set for some unused Star units that could be great at Star?

11205721,0,t1_df255rv,I would go with Iceberg. The reduced charge time doesnt matter as much with a brave weapon. Say you attack someone and you have Iceberg. Your charge is down to  at the end of the encounter. If someone then attacks you youll have Iceberg activate on your counter attack. The exact same thing would happen with moonbow except you would do less damage. If you dont get attacked by anyone then Iceberg will activate on the second strike of the next encounter you initiate. Once again your special is activating at the same time but doing less damage. The difference between a charge of  and charge of  is mitigated by brave weapons. I opted to give my Raven luna over moonbow for this reason,FireEmblemHeroes,df25kdw,2,t5_3imv0

11208767,0,t1_df189m7,Classic and oft hyped vantageclose counter might work well here. Jaffar is unique in that he already comes with a speed debuff and a weapon fit for vantage abuse. The idea is tried and true except Jaffar has the unique ability to soften up targets like no one else. If you can get a hp one and trigger vantage with an ardent sacrifice if necessary you can then initiate on any lone target. That target will receive your damage possibly counter if ranged then receive defres followed by a flat  damage. And  speed for their troubles. Next turn target runs into Jaffar with less hp and less def and vantage ruins their day. Id have to do the math but Jaffar has great potential with vantage if only because of his weapon. Initiating and leaving targets that softened up and with less speed makes for a great way to kill them when they try to attack him.,FireEmblemHeroes,df2i1qr,2,t5_3imv0

11223856,0,t1_df46cdz,My main gripe is that when its your turn and Vantage is up I noticed a lot of times you want to play defensively anyways so you pull back to pick off that guy you didnt hit twice. Otherwise you might be in range of Julias etc afterwards. With QR you get your kill before its your turn so you dont need to worry about finishing them off with Nowi or another one of your units  which can be a positioning headache i.e. try to finish that unit off but youre in range of other enemy stuff now.Also Ive been running an unmerrged Nowi so a lot of those clean one shots arent as common. IMO as you reach higher arena even a breaker skill gives more value. The reds you do face will be  and QR will be better than vantage.,FireEmblemHeroes,df47ku2,2,t5_3imv0

11242676,0,t1_df11yhi,Fates was far worse than Awakening at least the latter had a tangible story. Splitting the game up into three parts did not help the cohesion of Fates story at all and to be honest most of the characters were bland anyway. So were a lot of Awakening Characters but... the same can be said of every FE. Awakening did not fail in any way that other FEs before it hadnt failed so I get really confused when I see people pretending like it was bad. You liked the other games and Awakening is the same concept evolved and tweaked to reach a wider audience. Thus the only possible explanation is Elitism. They changed it and it succeeded so now it sucks. Depressing really.Awakening is nowhere close to the worst game Shadow Dragon still exists. ,FireEmblemHeroes,df6ca0i,1,t5_3imv0
11242747,0,t3_60g8lx,This list is pretty good but something I see a lot of people completely neglecting in their tier lists is the importance of BST. Four of the seven total heroes that you rate  are pretty unusable if you want to get a reasonably high score. Like dancers are nice and all but there is pretty much zero reason to run one solely because the advantage they give you is more or less not worth the  SP drop. You could argue that running a single mage could be worth it because it actually makes deathless runs much much easier but that again is just another part of the fact that this games Arena system isnt about using the best heroes to win its about using the highest BST heroes to win.Editing to add that this isnt a problem unique to your list or a problem I have with your list in particular just with how people are deciding these tier lists in general. A team with a single sub  BST hero will never match my Arena scores using Effie Y Tiki and Nowi. If I am able to beat the same heroes or similar heroes with Nowi there is zero reason to play Linde even if she is slightly better in terms of overall usability.,FireEmblemHeroes,df6ckfp,1,t5_3imv0

11251770,0,t1_df7bu1v,Yeah I was expecting Fliers to be really hard but the  weapon advantage in combination with stat buffs and even brave weapons is just too good.I didnt even recycle the stratums due to there being an archer unless the other units were also unfavourable. Camilla and Cordelia were great at killing archers with the  atkspd Brave weapons. Buffed Camilla even with her low base  attack was able to do some massive damage with  speed from skills to get to  and  attack to get to  plus Draconic Aura. There was one map where she onerounded a Female Corrin who I think had  def. Thats more than her base attack! Buffed Narcian even as a  star just bulldozed lances. Reds didnt stand a chance against Cordelia buffed up like Camilla but with  WTA.Im still leveling the armors one Draug is still at  and Gwen at  but I just saw a favourable matchup in Stratum  and the team worked really well three of the enemy units died without being able to do any damage. The last one being a healer that got some minor pokes off. Watching Ryoma suicide into Sapphire lance Quick Riposte Gwendolyn was fun.Id really love to give them some damage specials once I get some more SP there are a lot of chances to tank  damage hits to charge up big shots. ,FireEmblemHeroes,df7ddut,2,t5_3imv0

11252032,0,t1_df7br8k,If you really want to have Ninian attacking as an option Id say you want to go all the way and specialize hard on a certain kind of enemy.  Preferably a niche that your team has trouble dealing with otherwise.  Nowi has a whole  points of Atk over Ninian which is huge if you try to have Ninian cover a bunch of different targets its going to be very inefficient.  I know from playing th Stratum of the Training Tower a lot that when you hit the enemy with weak attacks it just feeds the enemys Special attack count and makes it harder for your stronger party members to attack safely.  As an aside it can make Lightning Breath a doubleedged sword yes it can charge Escutcheon faster but itll also charge whatever the enemys got fasterSo I would say Triangle Adept is a good choice and then Quick Riposte or Swordbreaker.  If using Quick Riposte I guess Lightning Breath could be an option if you want to get red mages though theres only a few red mages of note.,FireEmblemHeroes,df7eg9s,1,t5_3imv0

Ive thought of a few sets but cant determine which one is better.Silver Sword   Fury   Swordbreaker with Noontime sounds like a decent tank who should be able to go head to head with other Red lords while ORKO Hector so thats decent if nothing special. Noontime can be subsitutued with Moonbow  Ignis  whatever but sustain is kinda cool. Wo Dao could actually be used tooBrave Sword   Death Blow  ... Renewal maybe ? puts to good use his great attack stat  attack with attack boon is preeeetty decent.

QR is not that bad on her but I feel she is a more offensive unit rather than tankdefensive unit.Other option like Wings of Mercy can really expand her mobility. Threaten defence is also far weaker than a buff skill honespur. Since if enemy is in range of debuff generally it means they fought your units already and taken damage. Which means regardless of debuff or not they should die in next hit.She is also not tanky enough to be always left on front line.

11289370,0,t1_dfbl7cc,She was really popular preSI due to a mix of memes and one person on the sub showing how to use her well and everyone jumping on that. Shes far outclassed by Cecilia with her weapon though because it takes buffs like honefortify to boost the weapon damage. Nino can get at most a  boost from her blade tome Spur skills dont count only buffs a.k.a. honesfortifiesralliesanything that gives you blue number stats which is really  because the attack boost counts twice. However she needs a mix of start of turn honefortifies and rallies to get to that point. Horse Emblem lets you do the same thing but the riders have specialty skills that give  to two stats rather than  to one this translates to Cecilia OlwenUrsulaReinhardt or Leo being far superior with blade tomes. They get  stats translates to  damage and only need two units and no rallies to do it whereas Nino needs either  units with complementary Cskill boosts and rallies or three units with only one with a rally or a substitute like Eirika. Horsemages also benefit from additional movement but pay with lower base stats.

However I think Olwen has pretty good IVs and like rein she is best with her brave tome due to her low speedi think although it might be workableAbout composition as long as you have fortify and hone calvary on your team the blade tomes will clear house. Compositions can have tanksmelee fighters but I have also seen pictures on reddit with people who have gone full tome horse emblem.From what you listed I would try out Eldigan Olwen Cecilia and Leo but you might need to play around with SI before they work out.Good luck and hope this helped ,FireEmblemHeroes,dfg1fku,1,t5_3imv0

IIRC both of the playable dark mages can only be recruited from your nd playthrough on and one of the two has some obscure recruitment requirements on top of that.    They also both join super late into the game... and of the two the one that you can get a few chapters earlier is at best a mediocre unit he joins really underleveled and his stats arent great.

11332710,0,t1_dfcauvl,So after many struggles I finally adapted the Subaki strategy from   in video to win without having a huge tank like Hinata and my Nino at . Initial setup is similar subaki at bottom of unpassable wall right of mountain  Olivia to the right of Subaki and Nino and Eirika abovebelow Olivia respectively. First player phase Nino attacks the lance flier gets danced and drags back olivia out of danger range. Enemy phase Lance flier moves  to the right chasing Olivia while Sword flier and Michalis both move  down to chase Subaki. Lance fighter chases around top of map and red sword cavalry also chases after Olivia.Second player phase Eirika buffs Nino with Sieglinde and Hone Speed. Move Eirika one to the left out of her corner. Olivia moves into the corner. Nino finishes the lance flier. Subaki swaps with Nino to tank the red cavalry.Enemy phase Red cavalry attacks Subaki. Michalis moves to bottom right mountain square not in range to hit anything. Red flier moves to one space above Michalis. Lance fighter keeps chasing on top.Third player phase Nino hits Michalis twice danced by Olivia Eirika KOs him without taking damage. Subaki KOs the red cavalry.Enemy phase Red flier trades with Eirika and doubles her. She has x  HP left. Blue fighter is slow.Finish the blue lance by positioning Eirika next to Nino double buffs while waiting for him to get in range. Nino shots him with Olivias dance and the double buffs from Eirika.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfgjkfv,1,t5_3imv0

11333254,0,t3_61qq1t,Very good. Ive been throwing a build around the skill inheritance discord.Weapon | Assist | Special | Skill A | Skill B | Skill C  ||||| Brave Lance | Reposition | Galeforce | Fury | Escape Route | Threaten DefHoneThe idea is to pair her with a Hone Speed dancer if she has a SPD boon or a Hone Attack dancer with neutral or ATK boon. The first combination is intended to allow her to get quads by reaching  SPD. Somewhat iffy but if properly calculated she can guarantee killing two units with the help of a dancer iffy because she has to be countered once then use Galeforce to kill a third unit or Escape Route to the dancer on whom she can use Reposition to get everyone out safely. Ideally shed be able to quad a ranged unit that doesnt die within two hits to safely get an extra charge without taking damage but still be able to use Fury to proc Escape Route just as Galeforce is fully charged. If that wouldnt work out shed still be able to get danced after a single kill to Reposition the dancer out of the way assuming a ranged unit isnt close enough to be in range immediately after. Deathblow might be more reliable but I quite like the speed. The latter combination is good at killing things.

11341423,0,t1_dfgp2bu,Speaking as someone who got my  version to  before I promoted him and then did the same after... Hes a totally different unit at  than before. Before he kinda did small damage and doubled axes. After he takes such a huge chunk out of HP except blues that he is almost a powerhouse. In my horse emblem team hes one of my main attackers. Gave him Glacies. Occasionally oneshots more than just Camillas. Dragon Fang or Aura might be ok too.I asked on the reddit and everyone said to promote Nino or Robin.

11343561,0,t3_61qmro,Just as a sample here are some Genealogy units from each generation.FE First GenSigurd  Red Sword Cav. wielding Tyrfing. Cmon give us best lord already. I know cavalry get a base stat penalty but I really just want this guy to be good. And preferably easily workable into a Cavalry Emblem team.Levin  Green Tome Inf. wielding Forseti. Dude better be the fastest unit in the game base given how he is in FE. Strong ATK absurd SPD middling DEFRES with a higherthanmost mages HP to balance it out. Ayra  Red Sword Inf. wielding Brave Sword with an option for Killing Edge or Wo Dao both which would fit aesthetically. I only bring up Brave Sword because she gets it an event in FE. Hopefully a stupidly strong offensive character with high speed even for a Braveuser but squishy. Undoubtedly should come out of the box with Astra as she introduced it to the series even if it is kinda weak in FEHLex  Green Axe Cav. wielding Brave Axe. Again had an event giving him this weapon ingame so think it fits. He had the best DEF growth in st gen should be a tank on a horse to reflect it and deal decent damage as well. SPD and RES probably low to balance it out. Vantage maybe? He had it ingame.Azel  Red Tome Cav. wielding who cares itll be Raudrblade eventually Bolganone. Leo needs some competition in the red tome cavalry so here it is. ATK should be his strongest stat as it was in  with SPD being decent and generally fairly squishy otherwise.Jamke  Gray Bow Inf. wielding Killer Bow. Started with this weapon in game. Maybe give him Moonbow so that we have a bow wielder naturally wielding Moonbow. b Would definitely reflect his high damage output in his game. Thinking high ATK decent HPSPDDEF pathetic RES given how he is in game.FE Second GenOifaye  Red Sword Cav. wielding Armorslayer. Probably not optimal by any stretch but he does start out with one in Ch. . Probably generally balanced? Maybe ATK but weaker elsewhere see if he can get a niche as a outofthebox Hector counter.Arthur  Green Tome Cav. wielding Rexcalibur. Despite his thunder heritage he starts with a Wind tome in his game and his substitute was an out and out Wind Mage wonder if theyll ever get a glance in FEH. Thatd be interesting so hell be green here. Vengeance or Reprisal as a special to reflect that he always inherited Wrath. Hopefully wont be confused with Fates Arthur. Or FE Artur. Fee  Red Sword Peg. or Blue Lance Peg.  Im not sure where to put her  she tended to get the majority of cool lances from her mother but later games will probably keep throwing lance pegasi at us and unlike others she actually wields swords from base in her game. So for the sake of argument well make her a Sword Pegasus though she doesnt necessarily match any of the Swords in game so probably Silver. Should be really fast as shes canonically Levins kid but maybe not quite as high on the attack stat as she didnt have much of a strength growth and Levin didnt help her there. Altenna  Blue Lance Wyv. wielding Gae Bolg. Lancewielding wyvern woo! I mean what else would you do take Gae Bolg from her? Thats nuts! Anyways probably strong ATKDEF decent SPD meh but not awful RES is probably the best way to transfer her from Genealogy.Alvis  Red Tome Arm. wielding Valflame. Thats right a magic slinging armor unit to reflect his endgame Emperor status. Would also allow him to have sky high stats like he was ingame   in every stat! because of armors better BST. Fantastic ATK he had  MT in  good if not great SPD strong DEF and RES. They could even pull a reference and give him  in all his nonHP stats though thatd make him weaker offensively comparatively. For a special maybe Ignis since hes an armor and will have high DEF because it reflects his affinity for Fire and all.Ishtar  Blue Tome Inf. wielding Mjolnir. Why not another enemy unit she was an awesome character. She had great stats overall in her game because she was a boss but Id bring over her Vantage and give a really high attack sort of like Lilina and Sanaki so that she can threaten nuking people out of existence on counter when shes weakened.Id include Leaf and Finn but they seem more like to get FE love.So there you go. I totally didnt make Azel and Arthur mage knights purely for better units than Leo and Cecilia in Cavalry Emblem,FireEmblemHeroes,dfhrtzj,1,t5_3imv0

11345802,0,t1_dfhyp95,For most people who play below lt rankings arena which is most people at least  of the playerbase Takumi is still relevant and always has been. And I say this as someone who doesnt run into Takumi anymore. Beating him without losing any casualties was nigh impossible without certain units and as far as specific counters go the only extant ones are Hector who is extremely rare and is also another metagame defining unit RobinM buffed brave users in particular Cordelia Ogma Donnel and Hinoka have a high enough atk to one shot him with hone Henry who is otherwise pretty useless and a honed Cecilia. Thats about it.Hes better on defense but youre kidding if you think hes not at least a hightier threat on offense. Being able to bait out units with close counter is a huge boon which has always afforded him leagues more flexibility than any other ranged unit. Hes still really powerful even on offense.If Takumi is or was not a metagame defining unit then I dont know who is by your definition of a metagame defining unit. In the early days he was seen as nigh invincible. Even today for players playing under a ish threshold they will need to equip their team with at least some way of dealing with him or else run the risk of facing imperfect arena runs. Thats not metagamedefining? Inheritance significantly reduced his power but if were talking about most powerful units at neutral then there is no unit in the game who is stronger than Takumi. ,FireEmblemHeroes,dfi0yum,19,t5_3imv0

11346884,0,t1_dfi3lfu,Oh indeed it does! Thanks for reminding me  Ill edit it into the original post.    However accounting for the debuff only changes things marginally. The  defence lets spd Kagero kill so long as shes buffed as danced by Olivia. It still wont let  atk Kagero kill but it leaves Robin with  HP instead of  which lets a  Kagero kill him so long as Robin doesnt kill them first.    So the player controlling TA Robin will just have to be especially careful with positioning around spd  Kagero and a little less careful with atk Kagero. Otherwise its still mostly a wash for him.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfi5dh6,2,t5_3imv0

Female here been a longtime fan since FE who had stellar female character portrayalinteraction Lyn is prime example of struggling with societys expectation of female nobles and her own tomboy heart. I dont feel uncomfortable personally because Im quite jaded at this point FE isnt exactly the first to do this and bigtittiedfetishized anime girls are a dime a dozen in the weeb media field whether it comes to animes or video games. For better or worse FE as a whole went deep down the fanservice hole since Awakening and... well I shrug because hey my favorite SRPG series is now more popular than ever Ive gotten pretty good at ignoring content that would otherwise irk me which doesnt include fanservice generally though it did annoy me that Tharja placed th on the female side in the Legends poll.Myself aside there is definitely a sizable demographic of female FE players. I dont have the source on hand but I do believe they ran a poll not long ago and results showed that there are more girls playing FE than dudes I think that was conducted in JP. Back in  the friends who introduced me to FE were girls too.

11383833,0,t1_dfm9cwj,Palla is better than Caeda in every way so use her. Kills Hector just as well with Ruby Sword which is Caedas only strength pretty much. Your team seems good however Id put Fortify Fliers on Camilla instead not sure she has a default C let me know if she does. This is because Catria is your main tank so having Fortify on her doesnt benefit the one that needs it the most. On the other hand you usually dont want Camilla to take a hit anyway and she can stay in the back to keep buffing.If youre willing to promote a unit just for SI another Goad Flyer on Catria is great since they stack. Otherwise any Hone buff or even Threaten could be good since she is tanky.Cordelia and Cherche are fun and bursty units but I think Palla being your only way to deal with Hector as well as her Goad Fliers is invaluable to a flier team. Though a case could be made since you have the mage Camilla now. Youll have to test if you can beat Hector with her.As always I recommend RepositionSwap on fliers to take maximum advantage of their mobility.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfmc6nb,2,t5_3imv0

I have a few  blue units that are very powerful and I cant decide between them.My current team comp is Linde F!Corrin Olivia  and CatriaBUT!I have that  Catria and I also have a  Cordelia. And I cant decide between the two!Cordelia is much more of a nuke and can snipe enemies but with Triangle Adept she also exacerbates my teams overwhelming weakness to greens. Catria can handle herself pretty well in duels with her skills and combined with F!Corrins debuffs can duel with greens decently too so she makes a good offtank.I didnt know about IVs before I started training but I think my Catria is neutral and I think Cordelia is spd atkPreferably Id pull a strong red frontliner and replace F!Corrin and then Id run Cordelia since I wouldnt get steamrolled by greens but until then Id like any advice people would have.

11424354,0,t3_6308hx,I am still not convinced. He can have a niche use but his stats are still screwy. He is still a  star unit so he can do general blue things but he is cavalry and spread too thin across Def Spd and Res. He doesnt reach significant thresholds to make use of the Spd or the Res. That low Atk is atrocious. A special lets him actually kill something but you get less from him for putting a lot of effort into him than you would from another character. Mages can have a similar issue with stat distribution but low Res is generally more common than low Def. The low Def units generally attack from a distance and still pose a significant threat.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfqxtd0,1,t5_3imv0

11428811,0,t3_6356zl,If theyre having separate quests each round then that means one can gun for top spot in the first round and still put up a substantial fight in the next.Since the only way to get top spot in the final round is to save all the flags again as usual I dont think theyre changing the rewards except for the middle pack if theyre planning to do so The further rounds are more likely for you to earn better rewards. You can see that the basics go. Use all flags each round or a  share. Ranking Top R Middle R Bottom R.. Go for a  share. Theyll rank Bottom R Middle R Upper R.. Go for a  share. Theyll rank Bottom R Top R Lower R.. Or just go allin at the last. Ranking Bottom R and R and Top R.That said its likely that they are trying to balance out spending like this so that people earn the same set of rewards at the end as long as they use their flags.EDIT  I see that they actually have the rewards listed now in the ingame news didnt before. I feel this inherently discourages spending flags in the second round then youd be better off spending all your flags you get in the first round right there and then saving the rest of your flags from the later rounds for the last.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfrfzbm,1,t5_3imv0

Thats why the max box space in that game is I believe  currently.In this game you dont nearly get things as fast and what you do get some will be used for inherits at least. Therefore you always have enough space unless you summon like mad which I guess you did lol.Anyway I dont mind  box space currently since Im not near  even but int he future when more units are available and more people are near the cap Im sure theyll increase box size to  at least.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfspqa4,3,t5_3imv0

11443985,0,t1_dft190x,I did Lunatic with  Kagero  Minerva  Nowi and a lvl   Priscilla. What I did is to take out the dagger guy first the one near the healer with Kagero take note that I have to make sure that Kagero is out of the axe wielders range. I put Priscilla beside Kagero at all times to ensure that the ninja is healthy and well while Nowi and Minerva take the flank so that they can take a hit when necessary without dying of course.I let Nowi and Kagero again deal with Navarre. Nowi takes the brunt of Navarre while damaging him and I let Kagero pick up the kill on Navarre. The axe knight in my playthrough apparently stayed beside their healer most of the time allowing me to keep him in check. After taking care of the three I lure the axe knight towards Nowi Minerva and Kagero in the forest tiles on the lower right of the map. This can allow me to hurt the axe wielder with ease.Priscilla heals the team when needed. Minerva took care of the axe knight and I let Kagero pick up the final kill on the enemy cleric.I am seriously not good in explaining things but hey its the thought that counts right?Right?!?!?

Adding fury to lucina makes her live with hp so any buff or prechip will still let TA Nowi come out unscathed while swordbreaker build leaves Nowi at hp. Thats all ignorng the fact that the B slot is the strongest slot for skills. So do you want to use a stronger slot to do worse?

11457248,0,t1_dftoowl,Is there anything in particular that you struggle against?Without thinking of your team Camilla is stronger than Hawkeye. The only reason that I wouldnt user her in your case is that it makes you very susceptible to archers.From what you said it sounds like Hawkeye doesnt contribute very much to the beginning of a battle. Thats kind of a big deal. Does he do any tanking? Does he help counter any big threats? e.g. Hector? Ephraim?Camillas crippling weakness is that she can be very very bad against high def units. Camilla can dive on mages but so can Catria. They might have synergy together maybe Savage Blow gt Catria finishes or Seal Atk gt Camilla finishes.Considering what you have Id play with swapping in Klein for Hawkeye the idea is just to contribute to the early numbers advantage.

In fact to get an additional  you must fight  battles or  hours worth. If you fought every battle without sleep you get an extra  to your score more than someone who simply used up their flag bonuses.,FireEmblemHeroes,dfwer1m,9,t5_3imv0

Elises is about wanting to be like Camilla Leos is about being jealous of her affections toward the Avatar and Xanders is about their relationship with their other siblings. Camillas supports with Ryoma tackle her obsessiveness towards Corrin pretty well.Her supports with Hinoka are also pretty nice if you want something where she doesnt bring up Corrin technically its Hinoka who brings Corrin up and its only a mention. Im sure Camilla has other supports that dont mention Corrin but this is the one I remember haha. Also some people might wonder about the context of the Camilla character cutscene.

As it approached evening however Beruka started taking the lead back.The difference stayed around the same widening and shortening as both sides use their flags until after todays reset time when Subakis lead started to increase again. There is a definitive pattern over here. Oh and apart from evening yesterday Beruka also came close to leveling the score at  midnight. Which is when the round ends tomorrow. A premonition perhaps?

11475852,0,t3_63sx92,Frankly summoning is half the game right now thanks to skill inheritance. Limiting half the game is not entirely the wisest choice. Now if they had an interesting way to play the game without eating your stamina like crazy or using arena swords or being time gated there would be a lot more replay ability and more reasons to try less useful heroes. But for the foreseeable future with arena and training tower being  of your gameplay summoning will remain a huge part of the games enjoyment. I gotta say though Id love a challenge mode that spat out random  versions of heroes from every possible hero in the game could be repeated for badges of that type and didnt force neutral stats. Make it moderately hard maybe different difficulties give different heroes and you have a hell of a fun way to try for heroes without needing orbs but would require a large investment to get something to .,FireEmblemHeroes,dfws7tj,3,t5_3imv0

As Olivia is mainly going to be used to dance other units anyways its unlikely she will be found on the front lines.I would however recommend ruby on her instead of armorslayer. AS is situational and shell be of more use as a green killer with Ruby as it gives  atk  via triangle adeptness.If your end goal is a green killer than axebreaker is fine. If you have an extra WoM handy you should consider sticking that on her instead. a teleporting dancer can be very useful if you are in a sticky situation,FireEmblemHeroes,dfze0s1,2,t5_3imv0

11522578,0,t3_64gyje,Possibly.  I could see it having some tactical use in giving your team more coverage i.e. if you have a lot of reds and very poor greens give a Lancereaver to one of your reds to counter any blues you come across.  Ultimately I dont see it having much use in serious arena teams or anything except to catch some enemies offguard and maybe get some defense wins.However itd be a great skill for jokememe teams.  For example you could run a triple Lucina team.  One with Triangle Adept for greens one with triangle reversal for blues and one with swordbreaker for reds.  Thatd give you pretty good coverage.  Then throw Wrys in the last slot for maximum meme.  Call it team waifu.EDIT I suppose with Lucinas speed Swordbreaker isnt really necessary except maybe to stop other swordbreaker users?.

11540461,0,t3_64pcgq,Im being horribly indecisive about two of the skills Im putting on my Kagero SPD DEF despite some good suggestions from a guide or two Ive found. Right now she has Fury  and Savage Blow  but Im dragging my feet on the Special and B slot. I was thinking her default Reprisal was good enough especially since she murders almost everything without it anyway and the Fury selfdamage adds a little bit to it. I still wonder if Moonbow might be a more stable source of damage but I actually didnt see a damage comparison between the two. Either way thats not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.The real cause of conflict for me is the B slot. Im torn between Vantage and Desperation but Im slightly leaning towards Vantage since by the time shes lost enough health to be able to use it shes probably in a situation where shes more likely to be initiated upon and Desperation wont mean much there if shes dead before she can counter and its entirely possible if not probable with her low defense and Fury causing selfdamage beforehand. Then again I pair her with Azura and do my best to keep her from being attacked so Desperation could give her the opportunity to initiate on someone who she may not onehit and still take them out before they can counterattack. Id like some input that I could consider a tiebreaker here because Im likely never going to decide on my own at this rate. ,FireEmblemHeroes,dg44309,1,t5_3imv0

You might want to give Ninian and Marth hone spedatk to buff Nino.Or you could go with Olivia Nowi and Camilla.Alternatively you could replace any of those units with Kagero. Most of the game is infantry so she makes arena runs easy.In terms of color needs blue is the most important unit to have as there are a lot of reds in the game. Green is also useful in order to take out the blues that people leave on defense. I find red not as necessary since people dont run many greens on defense other than Hector and my own green units can take him out.,FireEmblemHeroes,dg4kyeh,2,t5_3imv0

I.e. you make experiments inside the game and collect data.Furthermore even if it is correct for matchmaking it doesnt mean that the formula used for calculating how much points you get follows the same formula as matchmaking.

11585537,0,t1_dg97x0u,By HP dependent skills I mean things like wary fighter or Vantage that activate based on HP. Lets say a unit has Vantage and to use it you need to be under half HP. If that unit has  HP then itll activate at  but if the unit has  itll activate at  so its useful longer. Hope this clears up what HP dependant skills are,FireEmblemHeroes,dg987io,1,t5_3imv0
11585714,0,t1_dg8yevv,Yeah the translated descriptions for everything are confusing sometimes lol no probQR only activates if youre attacked doesnt do anything on offense. I think QR and sometimes just QR is good enough. QR still has to maintain HP to keep using it so its still somewhat hard to get more than  trigger out of it. A common build is to pair up Triangle Adept with QR so that your defender can take  hits easily in case the enemy doubles.Good luck with orb saving lol,FireEmblemHeroes,dg98xku,1,t5_3imv0

With wary fighter and disadvantage that is   .  .? Or is it ? gtIf effie has  res plus fort plus spur that would be . She needs to have  hp.

You mention Lukas but hes far from average def. Otherwise average HP is somewhere around ? with average def sitting at . With Fury thats . And the threshold for QR is  at QR budget players probably wont  just to get QR. Meaning they need to keep  HP to keep QR up. Lets say an average atk stat is somewhere around  weve got legendaries going up to  with weaker units around low s. Youre still taking around  damage on average and dropping to  HP.

You arent an artist in a professional mindset otherwise you wouldnt say that. You didnt put in the hours of work for this. You didnt make the conscious decision to draw this way three more times and send it in as a final product. Therefore the original artist wants it to look that way and wouldnt if they thought it looked bad. Obviously its a matter of taste so opinions are subjective on its reception but to say the art is straight up bad is wrong. And you know that.

If youll use her for a very long time lifeampdeath makes sense because shell go in kill a unit run out with her B slot.

Id rather run RyomaNowiNino but Im not sure how high you merged Nowi and how much that would affect what you run into on advanced.  BST is a pretty minor factor in score now so pulling hector out wont hurt you too much. The main ways to boost score are through adding more skills to your characters and merges.  But a slightly lower score range that you can clear with no deaths is a much better score then a higher range with some deaths. ,FireEmblemHeroes,dgnxzj6,1,t5_3imv0
11715259,0,t3_673o7y,Skills like this are interesting. Basically to get value out of it you have to be unable to kill the target in one attack. With and without Poison Strike assuming you can deal damage you will always weaken your enemy.Often if you are able to wound the enemy you can follow up on them for the kill without Poison Strikes aid. Often but not always. The best use case are tanks be they physical or magical as well as our new WindsweepFiresweep users.It would certainly be more attractive if damage creep wasnt so insane.,FireEmblemHeroes,dgnycgm,2,t5_3imv0

11749614,0,t1_dgrmm2a,In what world is  speed not worth it. I think people are really exaggerating how slow his speed is. The only neutral speed unit you get doubled by is LonQu.A few more units can double  speed if you count speed nature or fury but over half of them are sword units like Hana and Lucina. Most people arent running Swordbreaker on these units due their fast natural speed and therefore will die to Ikes Swordbreaker.And out of the green spd units like Nino that can double Ike they all die on the counter so they cant even get their second hit in.The only units that can double  speed against Ike where it will actually matter is Linde and S Lucina. IMO that still makes  a solid speed to be at to avoid getting doubled.,FireEmblemHeroes,dgrujkf,2,t5_3imv0

The damage you take after combat is nonfatal and can push you into desperation range allowing you to swap ardent sacrifice for a useful movement skill I like draw back Not to mention your Nino looks to be spd so  of the time you wont notice the difference when having her speed honed.Also...life and death Nino gets ORKOd by most Julias Takumis and Reinhardts if they initiate whereas most Fury builds do not.

11765222,0,t1_dgp4jux,I feel Reposition is the best movement skill simply because it allows you to move other characters so that they can secure forward positions they normally couldnt achive.  Many times a the start of the game I need to safely get Sanaki in range of JuliaNinoCecilia for the easy counter kill.  Reposition allows me to use another unit to move her forward  squares then use her turn to move her into position.

11765256,0,t1_dgt57td,Well I may not uninstall the game over BoonsBanes but youre right that its an actively negative feature that nearly everyday makes me question whether Im actually enjoying the game or not. I seem to have worse luck than most and out of my   units  are them are either ATK or SPD.I am perfectly capable of spending money on this game a lot of it in fact but the fact that natures exist mean that even if I get lucky and pull the characters I want my purchases will never be worth the investment due to the extra layer of fuck you that they implemented. Thanks to that I will never buy orbs unless they add some way to change natures to the game. Multiple layers of this garbage is too much.Im sure there are many other people that are capable of paying but that extra layer of RNG on top of the publicized character pull RNG makes us completely unwilling to spend until some sort of mitigating factor is added. There is such a thing as a middleground between spending nothing and ruining your life over gambling.

Thanks!Speaking of this Voting Gauntlet just for a little rant though I never liked the idea of putting Tharja and Henry in this Voting Gauntlet. This is not because they are popular characters in Fire Emblem mostly from the fact that Awakening is one of the recent FE games like in the cases of Lucina and Camilla in the previous gauntlet. But because those two are clearly out of place considering the other characters involved here Julia is the Princess of Grannvale Empire Robin is the son of the leader of Grimleal Leo is the second Prince of Nohr... Henry and Tharja are... well they are mages from Plegia. It could be better if LilinaSophia and OdinSoren replaced those two. Just saying.Well whatever...

11799918,0,t1_dgxjwsh,Im not overestimating myself. Im just saying that while the OHKO meta is the most efficient it doesnt mean that others arent efficient at all. Ive seen people that can make it work easily so yeah. I play around high mobility and OHKO myself because that is the direction my team I enjoyed playing was better at but even then defensive play is legit. Im just saying For you because you mentioned you tried it and you call it a worse approach yourself. I havent tried it. Others have. It works for them quite well. Thats just it. I didnt mean offense in any way by saying it if that is what you understood then I apologize by all means. ,FireEmblemHeroes,dgxk813,7,t5_3imv0
