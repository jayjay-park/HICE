1084491,0,t1_chrjoyx,Definitely.  I started doing it as a source of income at the beginning of last summer.  Back then it was just buying  common vampire lords and making a couple bucks on them.  But now its buying  of the hand cards last sunday for  bucks each buying collections and this all in one week.  Its fun and you make money.  Too badI missed out on the traptrix trap holes though.  I actually wanted to build a traptrix deck for fun too.  Oh  and what do you think of Darklight?  I picked up  for  bucks and am hoping they will someday hit about  a piece. ,YugiohEconomy,chrk4jf,2,t5_2yr70
1770297,0,t1_ck29r4b,Vanity I think is short print though and is more universally useful. It is also possible to rule Summoners art not usable for pendulums too.But I aint taking that risk ,YugiohEconomy,ck2av6k,2,t5_2yr70
1798802,0,t3_2f4fu2,It is at a height in price definitely a time to sell from looking at market graphs. Jump on the hype train and sell it will probably only fall unless a SHWS deck tops with it. ,YugiohEconomy,ck5w3vn,1,t5_2yr70
1957677,0,t1_ckoyy6q,It could be ok as a side card. And it can be great in Burning Abyss if they have trouble against Pendulums. Its a bit slow since you will most likely have to give up a normal summon and by the time you get the chance to play him they will most likely have already Pendulum Summoned and caused damage. I wouldnt bother with it but if you can get them for  each then youre not missing much.,YugiohEconomy,ckp3pjb,1,t5_2yr70

3614135,0,t1_cq487j4,In the US to the right person you can get a bit more over the normal secret rare price Italian cards are the most expensive foreign ones in the US if I recall correctly. Thats all I can tell you though. ,YugiohEconomy,cq48k2k,2,t5_2yr70
4003431,0,t3_36alv9,Normally Ive been told  more than the original price but thats for the title just being slightly misplaced or something small or unnoticeable like that. But for something as interesting like this I would agree with everyone else when they say people would pay GOOD money for that. Theres really no set price. They would pay for whatever you so decide to set it at within reason of course. ESPECIALLY since its in German. Really good find man.,YugiohEconomy,crcmez6,1,t5_2yr70
