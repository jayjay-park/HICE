9927743,0,t3_5ho1iq,My first batch was so well received so I decided to keep going and make some more. Still mostly American patches partly because Im American and party because most British regiments used much more complex symbols than the simple American icons.Ive now included two variations of the Rainbow Division because they ended up cutting their rainbow in half out of memorial for their fallen brothers during the course of the war. The full rainbow looks much nicer ingame than the half. Ive also included the nd Division simply because so many people made NaziSwastika jokes in my first thread... so I figured Id highlight the fact that preHitler the swastika was actually innocuous and worn by AMERICAN soldiers that were fighting AGAINST Germany...Anyway enjoy. A lot of these were born out of request so if you have any more requests feel free to message me and Ill see if I can come up with something.
