8468495,0,t3_4vmt68,Outside of a rapidash I have noticed a decrease in pokemon. A small spot that used to spawn magikarp and occasionally other water pokemon seems completely dead. A few other spots known to occasionally have uncommon spawns have been dry. Even pidgeys and weedles are barely spawning. Im mostly finding the occasional ratatata. Im ready to give up on the game at this point. I was also late to discover some of the best pokemon spots and now theyve all changed. Its a long drive to the zoo and its starting to feel like its not worth it when everything near me is dead.,MadisonWIPokemonGo,d603n34,1,t5_3fcfd

8609978,0,t3_4xrh63,Chansey is mostly defensive like wigglytuf. I wouldnt use it much in battle with that cp but chansey wigglytuff and clefable all have a move called pound and its the highest DPS move in the game so keep a look out for that. Just got a wigglytuff with pound and Im looking to dominate some gyms.,MadisonWIPokemonGo,d6hudmw,2,t5_3fcfd
8613799,0,t3_4xqc8m,I caught my first one randomly one morning a block from my house when walking my dog. I caught my biggest one  CP when walking around the outside of the capitol building a week ago Sunday afternoon.

8636091,0,t3_4y23mu,Heres one way to look at it at least with the pokassistant IV calculator pokmon with higher possible IVs generally cost less stardust to power up for any given CP. If the possible IVs are lowish or if the range of possibilities is so big that its not informative but the CP and move set are great thats a great pokmon. Also if youre choosing between two nearly identical pokmon of the same type to evolve you can use IV calculators my favorite being pokassistant to decide which one to evolve if their range of possible IVs without doing any power ups dont overlap very much. If they overlap a lot it wont really help and generally isnt worth the stardust and candy to get more exact results.Almost every time that Ive had pokmon with IVs in the upper s and s the only possible IVs on pokassistant were in the s and s not something like  possible IVs between  and .Im level  if that lends any credibility.I hope this helps! Pardon typos Im typing this on my phone.EDIT Just to be clear I mean the pokassistant website is my favorite. I think there are some less than trustworthy apps with the same name and I definitely do not mean those.,MadisonWIPokemonGo,d6l4ams,2,t5_3fcfd

Theyre not always in the parking lot but if you walk south youll usually see at least two before hitting the gym on Cross Country.

9835700,0,t1_danlifn,This company is so fucking retarded. Ive given up any expectation that they will do something right for once. My mind is blown that the game gets worse with every update. They knew these problems existed because they said they were gathering player feedback. Now it will take about a month or two just to get an additional sightings tab if we get one at all. ,MadisonWIPokemonGo,dapm4c8,1,t5_3fcfd
