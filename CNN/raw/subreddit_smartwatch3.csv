8779957,0,t3_5062wg,Ive never had a problem with the GPS unless its been raining and I run twice a week.That said its not as accurate as a Garmin. When i did a few runs wearing both watches the total distance and total time would be near enough exactly the same on both watches. However the Sw had me doing a much more uneven pace with lots of peaks and troughs. This was throwing my segment times off so in the end i stuck with the Garmin for GPS.,smartwatch3,d735xzg,1,t5_355mq
