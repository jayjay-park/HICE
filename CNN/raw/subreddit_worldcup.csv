Stay on popular busy streets ask your hotel if there are areas nearby you should not walk around at night.  If you play with fire you might get burnt  meaning if you mess around with a mulher do programa or try to buy drugs you are exposing yourself to risk.  Brazilian cops give no fucks about you and will ruin your day.Also to avoid police beatings  murder stay completely out of range of demonstrations which will be everywhere. Do not leave your hotel at night except to get into a marked taxi. When you are safely in the taxi take a picture of the license with your phone. Do not go to night clubs or restaurants. Usually criminals will come in and just rob everyone there. Same with public transport. Stay in your hotel. gt Food  per kilo restaurants are very common.  They arent allyoucaneat you pay by the kilo.  Most I have eaten in are very good and good values.You can get a marmitex really cheap those are very good. gt Be ready for pushy high pressure sales tactics.  People will insist you take a tour get in their taxi go in their restaurant pay them to watch your car.  This is common in South America.  Dont get flustered a simple and confident nao obrigado while you walk away is enough.Dangerous advice. If you dont let him watch your car he will fuck up your car. Pay him after when you get back. gt South Americans will often pass off counterfeit bills on unsuspecting tourists beware.  Also you could have problems if you dont have small bills.  Often times vendors and stores cant change large bills.Double this. They NEVER have change. The lowest denomination bill you should be carrying is a .gt A complete cheeseburger usually features a fried egg piece of ham little fried potatoes and maybe corn or peas.  Great drunk food at  am.Of course you should not be out at am drunk. You will be robbed. gt Dont take any valuables with you when you go to the beach but take money and keep it on you.Take a maximum of  to the beach. Mass robberies are very common where  or more kids will come in and swarm the beach with sacks and just take everything. Dont fight  they will just beat you half to death and youll have to go to a public hospital. They wont go to jail either because you cant put kids in jail in Brazil. Dont bring a phone you dont intend to lose anywhere. gt Aa is pronounced asighee and is delicious.Prepared aa is delicious. Aa without sugar is vile and tastes like dirt.

But for them to be truly mean something they would need to be in the top four of many countries to assume this.It would be much more impressive to say that you produce the best soccer cricket field hockey and volleyball players rather than in those four listed sports. EDITBecause to list yourself as the best at a sport which is only truly popular in your own country and a few others is not overly impressive in comparison to sports that are very popular on a world scale.,worldcup,ciacm0b,-1,t5_2rdrs

1269071,0,t1_cic5gn6,Oh really!!? thanks a lot!! Im always worried about my skills its hard for me trying to deliver the semantics...and Im a lazy bum in grammar D...Yes you right in the past decades some clubs pressed the refs for injuries also at the time at least in Europe the gameplay was a little different. the tackles were more hard a lot more Im talking about broken legs see Montolivo is only one of the last..PL and some other central Europe leagues have the worst player when it comes to this...IMO so clubs asked for more whistling as you said for investments and for the players themselves security. But dont know where you from for understanding refs calls we need to put another ingredient in the recipe the crowd.As the time we are speaking  years ago the supporters were a big problem and I mean hooligansultras so referees had to take in count also the reaction of the crowd at their decisions on the field. If I remember right a couple of years ago in Canada after an hockey team won the Stanley Cup an entire city  I guess Toronto or Vancouver has been set on fire for all night long riots people hurted damages to properties all the range of acts of a civil war...So this scenario was the standard on Sundays game in Italy Serie A games are usually played on Sunday can you imagine? think about the refs when was on the point of whistling for this or that team a PK or a yellow card it was called psychological subjection. I know that maybe for a nonfootballer this sound simply crazy but if you ever been to a live football match preferibly a derby lets say RomaLazio youll be shocked to see . individuals screaming and chanting and insulting. Its absolutely amazing and scaring at the same time. In the years after clubs and federations did giant steps to fix theirs ultras first of all England did a perfect job they had the bloodiest hooligans in Europe and basically now seems all disappeared and this gave some reliefs to the refs they are now more comfortable in the calls.As I said to the user up here I like that U.S have this kind of supporters with that attitude if as I hope for them soccer will grow in the U.S they must be ready to face the problems related to cheers cheering could become a drug could really change people and also is the raw crowd that take control and all the social inequality are poured in a single closed space filled with like .. individuals.,worldcup,cicdy06,1,t5_2rdrs

1377629,0,t3_29vreq,It may just help to explain why some teams are stronger than others. But I agree that just some random stats may not tell the whole truth like while some teams in Africa or Asia have never beaten a team from South America. Part of the reason may be that they just have not played against one another that much.As can be seen at the world cup though the competition is very short and the players come with great physical strength. Based just on fitness alone other teams would have deserved to win more. But then you add experience malicious play and so on some teams just cant seem to have a break.The greatest history of all comes from playing at home. Its a huge advantage favored in statistics. European countries tend to win the world cups in Europe I think. Brazil is unique in that Brazil may have won a world cup in every continent out there. And like Germany Brazil is always advancing to the round of  and so on.In the world cup if you want to make history you need to start early. There is not enough chance to redo and to grow strength during a world cup. You either bring it or you go home. It doesnt last much but its intense.,worldcup,cioyzu7,2,t5_2rdrs

That is to say that the American TV is not trustworthy regarding the quality of the sports that they show.There are soccer games to be shown all year long.  minutes here  hour there  hours elsewhere. It adds up. Also once the result has been decided say a team has scored  or  goals the audience could switch channel and make showing the remainder of the match kind of pointless the longer it took with breaks.,worldcup,ciqvd1e,1,t5_2rdrs

1424210,0,t1_ciusdf5,Its kind of hard for the workers to buy the materials as you pointed out as a worker we tend to live much closer to paychecktopaycheck than business owners when every place that they would go to gather the raw materials is also owned by someone similar to the person who owns the factory. Its not like the workers can just go chop down trees for lumber or go mine an iron mine for materials because property rights stand squarely in their way. Its the exact same barrier that prevent peasants from owning the products of their labor in the feudal era. It doesnt exactly feel like weve made much progress for workers over the course of  years now does it? This is why Im not a big fan of private property its ultimately preventing people from working for themselves.EDIT I just realized that without context my opposition to private property may sound like I dont want people to have claims to their own homes. I dont oppose the kind of property that people occupy. I oppose the kind of property that prevents other people from being productive so in this case a forest that is used for lumber or an iron mine would be examples of harmful private property.,worldcup,ciusw0o,0,t5_2rdrs

1430892,0,t1_civjjq1,I think Brazil played pretty terrible that whole game. Much before the German goals started Brazil had already been forced to retreat the ball to the keeper  or  times because they couldnt pass the ball forward because they couldnt handle the pressure. End of first half they had about  shoots on goal we had literally zero. Second half they retreated to defense only then we finally got some opportunities and even then they scored  more.So yea Im pretty sure.

The  yard box is your house you are allowed to protect it as long as you make contact with the ball. As a striker one of the first things I learned the hard way is that the keeper owns the  yard box. You do not challenge him without expecting to get legally wrecked. If he has a fair challenge on the ball you ARE going to get hurt. In the event that you come out on top expect to have a target painted on your back for the rest of the match. Teams look out for their keepers. You WILL get your comuppance. As it should be.

Id just like to see more accessible games for people around the world and take less focus off of corrupt hosting decisions while seeing greater national team development.But yearly tournaments wouldnt be realistic with qualifiers and I guess national team development is the responsibility of each team.,worldcup,cns95n7,3,t5_2rdrs

3541910,0,t3_30tvxj,Just reinforces my thinking we need post game review and cards.If the camera caught him being stomped on he should get a red card applied at the th minute.  Sure in a friendly like this it might not mean much but if this kind of thing was standard it would change attitude and tactics in the field.  Things like deliberate injuries would not be an option to be made in the heat of their moment like what Neymar accuses.,worldcup,cpw00m7,10,t5_2rdrs
