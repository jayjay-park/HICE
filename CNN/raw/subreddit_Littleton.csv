5707504,0,t3_3tagtp,My wife and I moved from Austin to Littleton last year. We were certain wed spend a couple of years here and then head back to the Hill Country. It took about two weeks before we decided that this is where we want to spend the rest of our lives. We dont think either Austin or Littleton is better or worse than the other but theyre different fits for different people. If you like live entertainment festivals hot weather and cheaperlarger housing Austin is the way to go I think the same holds for San Antonio. If you enjoy the outdoors and all of the activities varied seasons a strong sense of community and value experience over materials I think Littleton fits better.As far as entertainment goes theres an Alamo Drafthouse here! We were thrilled to find the only Drafthouse for a thousand miles is in Littleton and we love to go to special events. Honestly though we dont go too often because theres so much to do outside. Theres these things called Open Spaces that are like state parks run by the county and without entrance fees. There must be a dozen Open Spaces in and around Littleton as well as  state parks. Your dog and son will be thrilled. Downtown Littleton is also super charming like Fredericksburg but not touristy. Theres two train lines to downtown Denver if you need a dose of city.Theres an general aversion to people from out of state moving here but we havent experienced any unfriendly behavior from being out of state. I think its because people feel like they found something special in this state and some people but far from even most feel protective of it. Honestly if youre excited about Colorado for what it is and not saying things like why isnt there an X here? where X is your favorite TexasCaliforniawherever thing no one cares where youre from. And we still say yall without getting weird looks. In general weve found that people are friendlier and more likely to start up a genuine nonsuperficial conversation here than in Texas. When asked what do you do? in Colorado people are happier to hear about the activities you do than who your employer is. ,Littleton,cx4kkyc,2,t5_2t1a8
