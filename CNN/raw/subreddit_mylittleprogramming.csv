This is done both to enhance efficiency and to make the function more ponylike by the addition of a tail causing it to be automatically optimized by Lisp as tailrecursive function.The version of this code which prints Pinkie Pie includes an argument not found in the normal version which acts to limit the number of times Pinkie Pie is printed. This is because while you can never have too many ponies it is possible to have Too Many Pinkie Pies    defun printpinkiepie n print PINKIE PIE if   n  printpinkiepie  n     printpinkiepie Reverting to C and a sort of goto we also have     Emulates Pinkie Pie just being Pinkie Pie.    static jmpbuf justbeingpinkiepie     Includes pointer to Pinkie Pie as multiple     instances of Pinkie Pie are possible if not     recommended.    void getpinkiepielocation  void pinkiepie                                     void callerlocation              If Pinkie Pie is foalsitting the Cakes foals her         location is clearly right where she is.        if  pinkiepiegtisfoalsitting              return pinkiepiegthereiam          If Pinkie Pie is not foalsitting her location is not         really defined.

3599982,0,t1_cq2b7r9,gt Judging from your explanation it works out as I expected in terms of how to implement it.Ok gotcha.  It was your using some generalization of the Chinese remainder theorem which made me think maybe you werent totally sure how it would flesh out but apparently I misinterpreted that.  Good job on figuring out how to solve it in polynomial time!Its actually really simple to implement a proofofconcept of this idea.  My proof of concept version is about  lines of python and theyre short lines.gt It is more surprising to me and interesting that just the technique of using modular arithmetic and linear algebra method  doesnt scale Yeah I know right?  Thats part of the reason that I like actually implementing things like this.  If I were just doing the math I would have come up with method  and called it a day.  If was only after I implemented and ran a few things I realized that Id need to come up with something like method .gt  Im sure you realize that although we call these things programming puzzles they have more to do with analysis of algorithms than the nuts and bolts of programming.Yeah thats sort of inevitable since I want the puzzle to be languageagnostic.  That said if you want to solve this one for really large grids you do have to worry about the nuts and bolts.  My C implementation isnt very sophisticated but still uses a few tricks which I suspect give a substantial performance boost.  I was hoping to get to talk about this sort of thing with people in relation to their own solutions but the lack of any actual code for other peoples solutions nixed that idea.gt Maybe this will have to change for Rogue TV but hopefully not. Im not exactly writing Dwarf Fortress here.Cool!  Ive occasionally been tempted to write a roguelike but I know Id get too carried away in adding sophisticated features to ever finish it.  What made you decide to write one?,mylittleprogramming,cq2mh0t,2,t5_2sw5z
