Its not a book I plan to reread anytime soon but it had such an emotional impact on me that I cant see it as anything other than excellent.I dont really agree with the messages about perseverance and hope to me its more about the human desire to survive even if there isnt really any point.Well the film felt more hopeful Im not sure why... I just know I felt like there was a tiny glimmer of hope at the end which I didnt feel when reading it.,calvinandhobbes,ceqly5n,2,t5_2qtxs

1588790,0,t3_2ch7o3,I was able to make it down today before the show wraps tomorrow. Going to snag a summary for this I made in another thread in the subgt Was really cool today see the original art. You had to sort of mentally force yourself to take it in more as art than just walk around and read the strips.gt Noticed some little things that you would had realized as a regular fan. Saw where Watterson penciled is Calvins head in the rough sketch in one strip to see where to draw the hair but made it light enough that it didnt show in print.gt They also showed how he would use two pages for the color prints  one for the ink but then a second page for the water color. Along those lines the would water color the colors and backgrounds for some of the book covers but they put acetate over it for the ink. gt It was really cool to see in person and one of the things my Dad and I really enjoyed together when I was younger. Glad we got to see it together.Hope you all enjoy Apologies for some of the potatolevel shots but I was using my point and shoot and they didnt allow flash.Edit Removed a blip about another piece flipping using paper inkacetate paint process as I cant remember if that was the case or if I am remembering it wrong. I do remember it not being as crisp as the acetate inkpaper paint works but that may have been something I misread or didnt notice fully.,calvinandhobbes,cjffsdr,2,t5_2qtxs

Bill at first they think its a great idea but then Calvins unit is called up to go to Afghanistan.Calvin is able to take some classes on his base in the mountains and sends emails reporting his progress to his parents Mom and Dad are of course worried but then they receive an email from Calvin that hes coming home and is done with the Army Reserve.At first they are relived but after waiting a few months Calvin shows up missing part of his left leg from the Knee down he will receive disability money from the Army for the rest of his life and begins to attend regular classes at the local college mostly paid for by the G.I. Bill and he is able to apply all the credits for the classes he took earlier.One day he asks Suzie out to a local sports bar for beer and hot wings once there he runs into Moe who laughs at Calvins missing leg Moe tries to take Calvins prosthetic leg only to be trounced swiftly by Calvin who knows how to fight due to his training much better than Moe who was also slowed down by his beer belly.Moe is humiliated and his friends accuse him of being unpatriotic by attacking a disabled war veteran Moe leaves and his friends buy a few rounds for Calvin and Suzie.Calvin walks Suzie back to her dorm room whereupon Suzie initiates a kiss and things continue on from there.Calvin and Suzie start to form a very close relationship and her influence inspires Calvin to gravitate toward art although he has already obtained a Bachelors in Business Administration he also dabbles in drawing cartoons with social relevance he creates a site to promote his pseudophilisophical cartoons which becomes immensely popular.To provide an income Calvin and Suzie tie the site to promote the dropshipping of various and sundry items from cellphone accessories to clothing it becomes immensely popular especially when Calvin jumps into animation.Calvin and Suzie marry and buy a house a few blocks away from their parents homes Suzie becomes pregnant and all seems right with the world Calvin and his Dad spend a great deal of time together his Dad being quite amused that one of the characters in Calvins comicsanimated cartoons is based on him.Unfortunately there are complications with the pregnancy due to a downturn in Suzies health resulting in the tragic death of their infant son Calvin Jr. shortly after his birth.Overwhelmed by the loss of their son postpartum depression and a diagnosis of Leukemia Suzie decides to end her pain with a couple of handfulls of pills followed by a bottle of Grey Goose Vodka.Devastated Calvin suspends all of his comicsanimation indefinitely.He remains in the house where he and Suzie once had much joy  with the blinds always down on the windows.His fans condolences flood his inbox followed by request after request to resume his creative endeavors but he gives them no reply.Calvins parents try to comfort him he placates them saying hell be ok all the while believing that he doesnt deserve to be ok that if he had just done something different Suzie would be alive today.Subreddits are created dedicated to Calvins brilliant work praising how so many were delighted and inspired by it after several years of being a virtual hermit Calvins mother persuades him to address his fanbase and he agrees to an AMA on Reddit.Calvin is brought to tears by how supportive his fans are and spends twelve solid hours on his AMA.His final reply to Reddit I didnt know quite what to expect but all the support and wellwishes have really helped me this day far more than you can know please know that as of today I am going to move on with life and resume my comic strips  and I have you to thank. ,calvinandhobbes,d09tf7l,15,t5_2qtxs

10518117,0,t1_dd0c61b,Well this is your problem that Watterson never approved the rights to market his comic strip characters and any dolls on the market are handmade personal projects that Etsy lets users sell. You are going to have to make compromises on your idea of what you want this Hobbes doll to look like. The likelihood of you finding a doll to your exact specifications are slim. Perhaps request a custom doll by a professional. ,calvinandhobbes,dd0cbu8,7,t5_2qtxs
