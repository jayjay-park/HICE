4721844,0,t3_3flenb,First build the hull of the ship for a frigate you probably want it to be around  blocks long. After confirming that it floats decided upon what weapons you want i often put a rotating turret on the front. For the turret itself you want to use azi. only turet for the connection between the turret and the ship. and if you want add some vertical barrel peices after the fireing peice.Things you could also add include missile pods torpedoes missile defense systems  im not quite sure how they work and some laser weapons.,FromTheDepths,ctpq7kj,1,t5_30aa4

Combine that with the fact that your hull is V shaped and you end up with a ton of armor and very little air space. You should reduce all that mass by either replacing some metal with alloy outter alloy means a huge boost in buoyancy and by shaving off some metal where unecessary is it really necessary to have  layers of metal armor protecting the bottom?Now if you dont want to do any of this the only ways are to do active stabilization either with a ton of propellers on the bottom front or with heliblades.,FromTheDepths,df9cuen,1,t5_30aa4

11354856,0,t1_dficix2,Like the others have said there is no best design because everything has some kind of counter. Yeah if you set two players loose in sandbox mode they can theoretically build two ridiculously large ships with superweapons and countermeasures galore and end up in a stalemate. In almost all cases however that will not be the case. There will be a resource limit imposed by the holder of the tournament if this is a community thing or you will only have so many resources available to build with in the campaign. Then you will have to build specialized ships.So as general rules Submarines are usually the slowest due to drag and the toughest due to water protecting them from shells and lasers. They are very vulnerable to torpedoes however. Ships are the most common and versatile craft and often need the least amount of power since they can rely on flotation alone but this is entirely dependent on the craft. Fliers are usually the fastest and they can be tough but they are difficult to build and usually need a lot of power big engines to maintain flight. Fuel engines are smaller and more efficient than steam engines and they rev up much faster than steam engines but steam engines produce a lot more power. Lasers do the best damage at range but they are very powerintensive and they can be inaccurate. They are countered by laser shields and smoke. Advanced Cannons are the most versatile weapon type. They can really be made to do anything you want but they are usually best at smallercaliber high fire rate guns. These are good against small fast targets. They are countered by shields. CRAM Cannons are the big bullies on the block. They are best at firing huge slow shells with low firerate and extreme damage. These are good against large slow targets and against shields. They are countered by LAMS and CIWS because of how slow the shells are. Missiles are also versatile. You can make anything from huge cruise missiles with a range rivalling lasers and a lot of damage to small shortrange missiles to intercept fliers and even other missiles. They cost a lot in ammunition however and they are easily countered by LAMS and CWIS.When I design a ship I start with the armaments I want it to carry. I design all the weapons first then I build the hull around them. This is kind of the reverse of what most people do on this sub but I like to think that a ship is an engine and an array of weapons and the hull is just there to carry them and protect them. I find it easier that way.,FromTheDepths,dfj1vq4,4,t5_30aa4

11578105,0,t3_6510li,Decided not to armour the engines. Though I did move the AI down elsewhere and armoured it. Also realised I didnt need THAT much general cards which meant more space for MORE armour. Now the AI has a layer of metal AND a layer of wood underneath that.

Link updated.,FromTheDepths,dg8dumy,2,t5_30aa4

Imagine the rumored Plasma Cannons with how fragile things are now.The balance changes are seriously something to get hyped for. Everything is becoming more durable crams are getting a projectile speed buff a total rework of shields. Etc.I dont know about you but I think itd be nice to not see heavy armor and full metal multilayered ships absolutely melt to one advanced cannon.We might even get the missile update crosses fingers,FromTheDepths,dgrt6g7,4,t5_30aa4
