My daughter however went nd  th and was bullied horribly and the school would do nothing about it because Im not an important person.  My brothers son had a great experience up to middle school and his daughter loves lower school there.  They get very fundamentalist about their bible teachings  almost to Bible Baptist levels.  St. Vincents is Catholic based but is accepting of all religions and teaches about religions around the world  Im pretty sure BC would be a lot like that.  I would never send my kids to SCD  not only because of the overly inflated tuition but also for the elitism that goes with it.  Savannah Christian was leaning too much that way when we left it.  St. Andrews is amazing but try The Sanctuary for prek  Ive heard really great things about it.  Garrison Elementary is great for the Arts for lower grades.   The best thing is to visit each school and talk to parents both current and former to get a feel for what is going to be the best fit for your family. ,savannah,csd09ve,1,t5_2qpx0

5156341,0,t1_cv7cpom,Perhaps you are uninformed as to the conditions. The local government schools perpetuates a substandard learning doing pomp and posing until they release their charges into the wild. The evidence is the long term castebased results. Georgia is among the public education armpits in the United States and Savannah is below average in Georgia. Not just below average but long term enforced below average. That is what I mean by rip off. The wonder of it is that the managers have the nerve to keep a straight face and give each other awards. And that local paper is as much a player in enforcing the status quo as the school management. This is certainly nothing new but it is like We have a sewer and we are PROUD of it is the local operational mode.Why so mad? You should read the worker comments at Glassdoor.com It really tells it to make the managing caste look like cocky rooster ha ha ha. Well if you have one foot in the modern world this type cynical exploit of tax monies is not acceptable.Allow me to add several local stories of even children from capable selfsufficient noncharity families with their needs met many stories of their kids going off to college and failing out in the first year.

Ive had employers pay me hr for skilled experienced labor and I took it because it was all I could find.

Basically a guy with tax problems who owned a house on the island and several cars told me there wasnt enough money to pay me a living wage for the work that was literally keeping his business afloat.

Drive back and forth from Richmond Hill to Tybee Island about ten times and then drive from Coffee Bluff to Rincon and back about ten times and then tell me about downtown and the southside like you think you are talking about Savannah. And dont forget to fork off to Johnny Mercer and get a serving of the Islands. Go in the evening and get yourself a golf cart and gin and tonic. They do not need to go downtown.

Not sure how long you plan to be here but if you have a block of time in the morning or the afternoon theres the Tybee Island lighthouse where you can take a tour of the grounds and climb the lighthouse stairs for an impressive view. Its in very easy walking distance to the beach too and admission to the lighthouse gives you admission to the museum in between. The beach has lots of shells to comb through and when I was last there I saw dolphins. It made for a really nice sunset experience.Theres the SCAD Museum of Art on MLK and... another place often displaying art right next to the Jen Library on Broughton whose name I cant remember. Theres a ghost tour which goes around in a hearse. There are tour buses for history buffs. Theres Forsyth Park which is scenic and has historical landmarks. Basically you could probably Google for interesting historical points around Savannah add a search for significant haunted houses and build your own walking tour for free. There are plaques fucking everywhere telling you why something is important Girl Scouts got started here! So did the first Jewish synagogue in the US! And the first church dedicated to a moor saint of some nature! so you can probably learn a lot with a smartphone Google search and a good pair of shoes.Also dress in layers because it will be cold when you step outside but walking will warm you up way more than youd expect but as soon as you stand still or go inside you will either be freezing or overheating.

10184377,0,t1_dbyaepe,I guess the reason I go to reddit on top of doing my own Google searches is to get personal opinions of what specific peoples favorites are. I know user reviews are kind of like that but not on the same level. If you are a redditor thats one connection we already have and if youre inclined to be browsing this subreddit you have some personal connection to the city.

10720506,0,t3_5t8zy2,Theres a group that has been riding Wednesday nights at GT savannah. They do a . mile loop a bunch of times not particularly scenic but it is mostly free from cars. As far as routes starting from the Pooler Lowes you could ride towards Savannah and after crossing I turn right onto the four lane road that goes by the the Mitsubishi plant.  For a longer ride you could then hop on Dean Forest and turn into Southbridge.,savannah,ddlqoln,3,t5_2qpx0

11502508,0,t1_dfzdyap,We are only here for two days yesterday and today. Yesterday we went to Moon River Brewing Co for lunch and it was really good and a great atmosphere in the outside beer garden. We walked over to Leopolds Ice Cream after and loved it. Its basically an old fashioned ice cream shoppe with a fun history! and the ice cream was phenomenal. Savannah Bee Company on River St. was awesome. You get to taste tons of honey and do a mead tasting if you want. For dinner we went down to the restaurant at our hotel Pacci and it was delicious. Today we are heading to the Pirate House for lunch which is supposed to be great. We were going to go to Vics for dinner but think we may do something else. And then probably going to try to get over to Forsyth Park. Maybe try Peaches and Cream another ice cream place and Chocolat a chocolate shop. Ill keep you updated on those places if theyre worth it  ,savannah,dfzt5bs,1,t5_2qpx0
