7387065,0,t1_d2hrooa,I cant speak for others but heres why I think this sub is worthwhileMany unsuspecting redditors figure that a name like rCatholicism would belong to a mainstream Catholic community.  In reality it does not and since corrective voices arent allowed to say so within the rCatholicism community subs like this show it for what it is.And thats a community... dominated by reactionary zealots who take themselves or perhaps Ludwig Ott as their supreme authority on matters theological who are openly hostile not only toward Pope Francis but toward other recent popes whose teachings dont conform to their own ideas who consistently mock and sometimes explicitly reject the teachings of the last ecumenical council who long for a false and an idealized past pining for the reinstitution of some of the ugliest parts of Church history including capital punishment as a fitting punishment for gay sex.I think that your sub does a lot of damage when it comes to how Catholics are perceived at least on reddit.  I post here not to disparage Catholicism but the very opposite  to show that the backwards views consistently upvoted on your sub are a distortion of it.,ShitRCatholicismSays,d2hux3r,8,t5_37t7d
