5439877,0,t1_cw6omun,Oops didnt realize your title said that your mom died I am so sorry about your loss. I dont know how you feel with this but there are people with church organizations that would drive your sister home from school.  Also for the Gofundme account you could talk about the fact that you are in need of money for FOOD for your sister.  People can donate gift cards to Publix or Walmart too I am pretty sure.  Although it stinks that your husband doesnt see your point of view try to see his too as this time is probably also hard for him.  Either way I would look into getting Medicaid or food stamps even if you cant get as much as you would otherwise.  If you dont work for a large corporation you could see if they would occasionally pay you in W form tax free which would reduce your income in the eyes of the people awarding you the subsidy.  I am sure you know this but just a reminder that getting a cash advance is the worst possible thing to do to screw up your credit.  Use this as a LAST resort.  I wish you the best of luck and tell me if you would like help setting up GoFundMe Id be happy to! ,care,cw6zx8a,1,t5_2rpws
