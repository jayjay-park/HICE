3502795,0,t1_cprhnyy,I dont like your tone and the way youre talking with me.  We are not friends or mates youre just the guy from the internet who I never talked more than  minutes with. Please talk to me the same way that I talk with you  with respect without stating your opinions as facts telling me that if I dont listen to you my project is gonna die on its bottom. Especially when you dont seem to have any experience with it seem to miss the basic concepts like inventory limitations friendslist size or  hours in a day and the ideas you throw like adding people are just ridiculous and impossible to execute. Additionally the things you say about the current state of this show that you have no idea about how it works like now which is somewhat surprising considering you seem to know so much and the whole project is open sourced how it can be shady then?.TLDR I am not going to add thousands of people will you give ALL clients of the company you work for your private phone number so they dont have to follow basic steps? and I am not going to implement internal currency as long as I or users are the ones paying for backpack expanders. I already stated this but since it went past your head Ill repeat myself I cannot afford to provide unlimited space for items for every user and I dont have time to do everything by a hand.If Im sending users payouts by the hand I can just as well run the whole thing in my notebook ,saloontf,cprjkqw,4,t5_32xax
