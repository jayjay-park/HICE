4237668,0,t1_cs39vjf,Bullshit.SRS doxed and harassed Destiny until he lost sponsors and reddit admins did fuckall about it.  The mods fucking editted their CSS in order to help the harassment spreading nude photos of him around amongst other things.That subreddit has been doing shit like that for ages and hasnt been touched.  However because they claim to be defending the oppressed they get a pass.  Because FPH attacked people that are a valuable advertising demographic they got shut down.You can buyin on the bull the admins are feeding you but Id look at actual facts rather than just the spoon fed garbage.,Koans,cs3aau4,2,t5_2sv2y
4237688,0,t1_cs37t2a,Because if we dont rally behind the worst were sending the message that theres a line beyond which propriety trumps freedom.By intentionally defending the worst example were saying that freedom always trumps propriety without exception.By defending those like the Westboro Baptists and the KKK we show that freedom trumps all in a way that we wouldnt show if we only explicitly defended the unjustly disliked.Thus the old maximgt I despise what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.,Koans,cs3adsn,20,t5_2sv2y

4239864,0,t1_cs3gtqt,Except bestof uses np.reddit. Brigading can be harassment as exemplified by the multiple times SRS has gone after individual commenters on post they ridicule. Brigading is also against reddit rules another thing the admins have the ability to show authority over which obviously they havent. Admins shouldnt  cherry pick subreddits to ban just because a subreddit fatpeoplehate could interfere with Reddits finances.,Koans,cs3jbi9,4,t5_2sv2y
