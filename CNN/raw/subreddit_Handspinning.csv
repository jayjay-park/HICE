762761,0,t1_cgqxxqg,Thanks!I feel like the ends are so loose... What join do you use? Im typically a russian join kind of gal. Do you think thatd work out?,Handspinning,cgqzcx8,1,t5_2rx72
763566,0,t3_22w42l,What you should be doing is making your singles longer as it is easy to keep adding to them.  Once you start plying it becomes yarn and a  ply is hard to hide a join into.                      If your determined to do short batches Splicing the singles to the ends of your plys should work it might leave the section of splice a little thicker then the rest but not nearly as noticeable as knots,Handspinning,cgr2nfv,5,t5_2rx72

3083663,0,t1_cohm55q,How about finger knitting? Ive never done it though so I have no idea how it would workhow it would show off the yarn.  Maybe its time to commit to a pair of needles or two. ,Handspinning,cohmc7u,2,t5_2rx72

4226554,0,t3_399wwk,I like browsing etsy for sellers who put their stock on sale.  If you dont mind surprises some suppliers not on etsy will sell big bags of Ashfrod mill ends for a very good price.  I bought one for  cdn and it was  kilos.  There was quite a bit of Corriedale in it not a fan of personally but there was also lots of merino and merinosilk blends.  Lots of colours I can blend myself or spin straight one of the merinosilk pieces was over ozs.  I figure the Corriedale will make a great learner fiber should grandkids or nieces show an interest.  I even got some unprocessed locks in there so one day I can try my hand at washing it myself.  I had a fiber club membership too for  months which has really given me the chance to spin things I would have never thought to buy myself yaksilk.  I let the membership lapse because Im sitting on a huge amount of fiber at the moment but I will definitely go back to it when I can put a dent in what Ive got.  ,Handspinning,cs205nn,3,t5_2rx72

6380872,0,t3_431wie,I got a set for christmas and watched lots of different YouTube videos in preparation. Just search for drop spindle spinning or something like that and youll find lots. I bought the book Respect the Spindle that was recommended in some threads here and it was also really helpful. Finally just practise practise practise. I found shorter sessions to be better than longer. I just stop when something goes wrong and I am frustrated. Just sit down for  minutes each day and you will get better. But accept that it will take time and practise. Edit Also keep in mind that a lot of people post their first projects and in the end they say it was their first realcompleted yarn or something like that. Most peoples real first attempts dont look great they just dont share those. So a lot of first projects you see there arent real first tries.,Handspinning,czexqk3,1,t5_2rx72

7965984,0,t3_4oc34c,Yes you can spin her fluff!  It might be easier on a lighter spindle or mixed but neither of those are  nessesary.  On the grooming all I can recommend is keep at it.  If they are not trained to be OK with allover touching it can be a struggle to groom but you are right.  Just leaving it will make mats that have to be cut out which sucks.  Maybe do belly first so you are not tempted to skip and the rest of the grooming can act as a treat for letting you touch her belly?,Handspinning,d4bgach,2,t5_2rx72
9440692,0,t1_d9ci4uw,It is MerinoBambooNylon It was from a fiber box so I dont know the proportions. I spin worsted as I understand it which allows for the fine length.,Handspinning,d9coabs,1,t5_2rx72
9873071,0,t1_dat9slu,Well   odd yards two plyplus singles took two sessionsafternoons and plying was really fast. Considering that the wheel is new to me  it was comparable if not faster than on my big saxon production wheel ,Handspinning,dauhgfv,1,t5_2rx72
10387268,0,t3_5ju5aa,Most comfortable so far was my desk chair with a pillow to keep me from slouching. The arm rests and adjustable height make it easy for my to rest my arm on something while spinning as well as adjust my height to the wheel. In a quick pinch Ive used a dining table chair with lots of pillows for my back. Stretching frequently while spinning will alleviate the back pain some plus its always good to take breaks so you dont burn out too quickly while spinning ,Handspinning,dclgmmr,1,t5_2rx72
10649779,0,t1_dddengd,I wear my socks a few times before washing and I find that the merinonylon  commercial sock yarn ones feel a bit clammy after the first couple wears whereas the wool ones do not. I do use a commercial woolnylon yarn for my partners socks.The other reason for mohair is that one of the reasons I spin is the animal factorthat is I am very interested and emotionally invested in using sustainable natural resources. This is also why I often buy from fiber festivals or farm storesetsy. Mohair is oft recommended as an additive to wool blends to add strength. Silk is recommended too but I like goats. Also I think yarn twist and knit gauge contribute at least equally to durability in socks. I knit at least the gauges recommended in Clara Parkes Knitters Book of Socks if you havent read that you really should and so far so good. ,Handspinning,ddefxyl,2,t5_2rx72
