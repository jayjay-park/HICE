10453420,0,t3_5pm3ph,Well theres two schools of thought behind picking a school. On one hand Purdue has an excellent Industrial Engineering program. Theyre very well renown in the industry and if youre looking for which one has the better program I would go with them all the way.On the other hand in college you grow and develop as a person more than anything. So at the same time its very important to find an environment that allows you to do that at a comfortable pace. You may find that Wisconsin is more appropriate for that reason being a big state university.I would recommend visiting both schools talking to professors talking to some students and shadowing a student. You need to find where youll get the appropriate worklife balance. You dont want to be able to party all the time because then when you actually have to do something you have no motivation to do it. You also dont want to go somewhere that you are constantly working. Your stress level will be much too high and your productivity will suffer because of it. That mix is different for everybody and its probably the most important thing to consider. I would avoid attending things that are put on by university recruitment. Ive always found that you get a false sense of what the program actually is. They get the nicest people with the biggest smiles to take you around campus and make you feel good about it but thats not representative of your daytoday life there.,industrialengineering,dcszxbr,7,t5_2s7m6
11546357,0,t3_64rc8h,You arent screwed. Dont come at it with a neged pov. First thing first you need to land a job. Did you apply only within one industry ie manufacturing finance etc? If so start looking in others the beauty of the degree is that it can be applied in almost any sector. If you have exhausted that pool turn to your professors. Explain them your situation and how desperate you are to land some experience. Professors are almost always involved in so research and even if it isnt within the department they can probably hook you up.  Last but not least revise your resume  times if your resume looks bad ppl wont consider you for the next step. Reach out either to your schools career center a professor or a success friend and ask them to critique your resume and then improve it according to their suggestions. If you are comfortable enough with it you can PM it to me and Ill be happy to help. ,industrialengineering,dg4s5qw,5,t5_2s7m6
