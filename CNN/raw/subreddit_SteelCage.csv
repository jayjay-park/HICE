2975050,0,t3_2u7pb7,Fun and I love NXT but there just arent any heels right now in NXT. It basically doesnt matter but it would be cool to have some legit heels. I actually wouldnt be all that surprised to see Owens win at Takeover though his merch sales are huge and people seem to get it. It would also further the sympathy for Sami deal. Think Sami retains but I could also see whatever face emerges from the tournament Im thinking Finn taking on Owens.,SteelCage,co6a1pr,1,t5_3661b
3325686,0,t3_2y8uu6,I agree. And when you tell those that are upset to stop watching they come up with excuses like But I love Ziggler and Cesaro I have to watch!! They like to complain saying But it feels so forced Reigns shouldnt be there! I honestly feel that in the storyline Bryan is more forced. Last year he had months of Authority build up. It made sense. This year he came back at the Rumble after a career threatening injury. There was no build up for him. Meanwhile Reigns has been here putting in work to earn his spot. Yes Reigns was out too. For like two months. Bryan was out for . I get that Bryan is the most popular wrestler. I love the guy. But the entitlement of his fans and the forcing of him into the Mania main event has made me hate him a little. I was rooting for Reigns at Fastlane because of that. Should WWE be pushing the most popular guy? Yes. But they arent and the amount of complaining and lack of actual action by the smarks isnt gonna change anything.TLDR Bryan was being forced more than Reigns Smarks arent gonna change anything if they keep watching and buying stuff Im starting to hate Bryan because of smarks.,SteelCage,cp7ctt4,11,t5_3661b
3358342,0,t3_2yn21v,The only thing that Im not super keen on is the Divas TagMatch. The fact that the championship isnt on the line is kind of a bummer. But outside of that I really dig it. I dont see predictibility being a problem so much as long as the show itself is good. Look at REvolution. We knew the ending to those matches before they were even offically booked and they were still awesome,SteelCage,cpb2qpg,7,t5_3661b
3378293,0,t3_2yuvy9,Wondering if Rusev will do anything fun Im really digging the buildup to his match with Cena. Whats going on between him and Lana in characters been pretty fun to watch.,SteelCage,cpdcn1f,3,t5_3661b

3397175,0,t3_2z0tuv,Orton great look and persona best theme in the business right now.Adam Rose his goofy party gimmick made me laugh I wish he would get a decent run.Dean  because reasons.Roman same. Dude has an aura about him hes getting better and better.Mark Henry not sure why I just really like him and his music.,SteelCage,cpfi5ta,1,t5_3661b
3404697,0,t3_2z6xri,Good to see wrestling journalism is still shit.There is literally nothing wrong with saying journeymen. Hell its probably a badge of honour to most. There is nothing to see here but a poorlywritten piece written by someone with a clear agenda.Reigns does need to stop doing these interviews though. Fucking hell. Just let his actions do the talking.,SteelCage,cpgczy9,8,t5_3661b
3428808,0,t3_2zhjc8,I like the male centric soap opera of the whole thing.  Dont really care about the in ring ability as long as they can tell a story.  ,SteelCage,cpj3ypt,2,t5_3661b
3435487,0,t3_2zjmdi,If I was to bet my own money on a winner I would put it on The Undertaker.  Id be pretty surprised if Wyatt beats him.  I dont necessarily think its the wrong decision to have Taker win but a Wyatt win would be more interesting going forward I believe.,SteelCage,cpjvdab,1,t5_3661b

4028401,0,t1_crc321k,Yeah. Just go destroy people. Once upon a time there was something called managers who were perfect for guys like this.  ,SteelCage,crfgujs,1,t5_3661b
