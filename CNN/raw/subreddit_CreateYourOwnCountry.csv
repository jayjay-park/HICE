550202,0,t1_cg2sxkp,To explain further the fear comes not specifically from the actual actions of the USC but from the possibilities. If one or two nations in Europe become too powerful they could if they so chose eliminate all smaller nations in the region and take total control. While the USC has not shown any behavior that would cause Europe to worry about this the potential still exists and the balance of power in Europe which is an important political creation dating back to the Peace of Westphalia may still be upset.,CreateYourOwnCountry,cg2tbl1,1,t5_30vp3

651493,0,t1_cgdzctp,The Republic of Shanghai reminds the UTSC that it would have been more inclined to accept the offer of the UTSC had it not made it clear that the offer was not a choice.gtWe will also not target and mistreat civilians.The Republics official responsegtExcept for those starving to death because of your blockade. Have you forgotten about them? One admirable trait of the New Han Empire is that though they were excessively forceful against Taiwan there were no illusions created about their intentions. They did not approach Taiwan with a compromise and attempt to fool the Taiwanese into thinking there was a choice Taiwan was fully aware that the NHE was going to attack. The UTSC on the other hand did create an illusion of choice they are no better than any other belligerent nation but they would like us to believe that they are. We have many allies and we warn that an encroachment upon our sovereignty will not be as simple and swift as you so arrogantly seem to expect.,CreateYourOwnCountry,cgebp8h,1,t5_30vp3

893408,0,t1_ch5hhcq,Welll thats because it really depends on the person and the country. Fooorr example in my time playing this game on multiple sites I have seen A massive  player nation conglomerate with complicated internal politics but little roleplay.An aloof superpower with a cabbage fetish. A chronic inactive who had no official land but lots and lots of nukes. He would pop in every couple of months to nuke whoever was close to Siberia.A nation comprised of one man and a handful of hilbilly slaves based in a shack in Montana.So yeah the reason it is confusing is because there really isnt a standard. Everyone has a different level of involvement and you can do basically whatever you want.,CreateYourOwnCountry,ch5u20c,1,t5_30vp3
899675,0,t1_ch6ip1k,Its very fun to start fresh so to speak and experience CYOC in a setup where no one country or group of countries is dramatically more advanced techwise than others. The three superpowers in our game have caused a relatively stagnant environment for the older nations war is frowned upon when most of your effective weapons involve the destruction of the world as is dunking noobs and the discovery of clonespies in your territory who have replaced your political candidates is just as likely to lead to closer diplomatic relations than it is to lead to war yes this is a real example. Nowadays tech research diplomacy and exploration is the most fun bit in the game my current pet project is heading back from the center of the Milky Way.  New nations have it a bit better there they can go to war without breaking anything big. I may actually go a tiny bit less active here next week there is a war brewing over there right now that I need to judge.The situation is a bit worse for other simulations though most of them are older and their superpowershyperpowers have armies of trillions and fleets of trillions of ships and some nations own entire galaxies. To give perspective this CYOCs tech level compared to the one we came from is about the same as ours compared to NC or Runescape CYOC.,CreateYourOwnCountry,ch6jqjq,1,t5_30vp3

They have nuked and completely obliterated Buenos Aires our former capital in an attempt to make us surrender Brazil. Watch yourself as their interest may turn to Columbia as it along with Brazil and Venezuela was formerly the territory of Atlas close ally the Technocratic States of Columbia and Atlas has expressed an... obsessive interest in reclaiming these territories but mostly Brazil so maybe youll be fineMay you find fortune and peace.,CreateYourOwnCountry,cha0u4d,3,t5_30vp3
