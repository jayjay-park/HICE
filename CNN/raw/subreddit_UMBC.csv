105481,0,t1_ceqbkoo,This was my experience as well . There was no instruction and I dont recall even reporting my scores. I did carpool with people from campus to the facility so that was nice.,UMBC,ceqfv06,1,t5_2rggg

781009,0,t3_232f5w,It really depends on your major however many of the gateway classes and  level classes will probably be filled. Hopefully you wont need to take too many of them and get the ones you need. Good luck and welcome to UMBC though!,UMBC,cgt1z1g,1,t5_2rggg

2265734,0,t1_clrpc2v,Im going to slightly correct this and say its not actually entirely professor based. As I mentioned there could be restrictions from the department or elsewhere. So even if the professor is completely for letting you in it is sometimes out of their control so dont expect them to solve your problems even if they want to.Otherwise I totally agree its worth an email.,UMBC,clrrj8i,2,t5_2rggg

3002856,0,t3_2ukcb2,Most of my classes arent that bad. There is one easy class that I have once a week and two classes that probably require some work. In my other two classes its the usual read and takes notes to do well on exams. ,UMBC,co98smm,1,t5_2rggg
3769800,0,t3_33kcc1,If you get your associates from AACC UMBC will pretty much automatically accept you.  I had a...lets say troubled...academic background before getting my shit together and getting my associates.  Multiple starts and stops lots of withdrawals and failures.  Went back to AACC pulled some decent grades for two semesters to graduate and then transferred.  I will be graduating this semester with my computer science degree from UMBC.  If your aid is frozen I would suggest taking all the classes you can at AACC as its orders of magnitude cheaper than UMBC.  Im not sure what math you need for cyber security but I unfortunately had maxed out my transferable credits before I had to take calc  and linear algebra.  If you can take the math at a community college its cheaper and easy easier.  I had friends who took the same classes at AACC at the same time I was taking them at UMBC and it was ridiculous how easy their class was compared to mine. ,UMBC,cqlzgjy,2,t5_2rggg

7064003,0,t3_4cai57,Team based genetics is definitely a pain because of the set up but it is not too hard of a class materialwise. The most important thing to do is to read the material before the relevant discussions thats pretty much all. Most of the learning you will have to do on your own and the discussions are more of a supplement.Also Wagner and Miller are both really great to work with and are very open to helping students.Sorry I cant be more specific as I think it has been almost three years since I took the class so I dont remember much but that is the big picture stuff that I do remember.,UMBC,d1h2e94,2,t5_2rggg

8939774,0,t1_d7eljys,Please dont do this. Adding your own access point will only make things worse. You are still sharing the same air space with the existing infrastructure but your equipment will not coordinate with it so you will cause significant interference. The WiFi is slow because of the physics of the situation not a poor implementation of the network. If you need speed plug in. That will improve things for everyone.Also not broadcasting the SSID will not hide your network. The Cisco WAP controller generates a list of every rouge access point in the area broadcast or not. It is really easy to track you down. ,UMBC,d7mfg7a,1,t5_2rggg
