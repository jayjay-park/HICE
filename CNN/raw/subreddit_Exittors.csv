9,0,t3_1u2x2p,Living in a Muslim country i.e. Kuwait government and religion are almost synonymous. To hate one is to hate the other.Muslims dont hate America or the US Govt. on religious grounds. They hate US foreign policies as it relates to them. Even as an exmuslim I too despise US foreign policies. ,Exittors,ceefud5,5,t5_2zdp4

99924,0,t3_1v7q27,In Islam Aishas age she was one of Prophet Mohammads wives apparently his favorite brings forth a lot of apologetic. They argue that Aisha was at least in her teens when Mohammad married her and consummated the marriage. They do this in an attempt to protect their Prophet from accusation of being a pedophile. I personally wouldnt call him a pedophile because he did something that was perfectly acceptable at the time  years ago. However one of the threads on which Islam hangs on is the claim that Mohammad was directly guided by Allah an allpowerful allknowing being and that he was sent to earth as the perfect example for all mankind for all time. If this is true then Mohammad would be labelled as a pedophile because he was supposed to be the perfect example for all mankind sent down to earth by an allpowerful allknowing being...surely this allknowing being knew Mohammad would be considered a pedophile by todays standard? Why didnt he forbid Mohammad from marrying her? Particularly since he had a number of wives and did not need to marry Aisha for any practical reason? If muslims accept this they have to concede that Mohammad got something very serious wrong therefore they have to concede that Allah set a bad example for mankind...The perfect religion would not seem so perfect after all...Islam all kind of falls apart it actually takes very little for Islam to fall apart which is why muslims so passionately defend every facet of the religion no matter how ridiculous they end up sounding.Since apologetics know that if Allah is real Mohammads marriage to a  year old makes no sense they vehemently argue that Aisha was at least in her teens at the time of consummations which is still a little weird by todays standard since Mohammad was in his s. If they could they would go higher still but if there is little authentic sources saying Aisha was a teenager there is nothing that even hints at her being older.The fact of the matter is she was  when she was married to Mohammad and approximately  when he had sexual intercourse with her.  ,Exittors,cept20p,8,t5_2zdp4

159468,0,t1_cewfh5h,gt  I wonder how they are going to square this circle in the light of external evidence.The same way they and the Mormons and Jehovahs Witnesses have always done it by instructing their followers that it is verboten to look at non church sanctioned sources. That those sources are unfairly biassed and incorrect.And as we already know some people will be curious and look anyway. And those curious people will become the new ex members.,Exittors,cewlhgz,2,t5_2zdp4

590619,0,t3_20uosb,I hate it because I believe at its core it is harmful.It teaches you to make decisions based on emotions which it claims are a holy spirit. It teaches paranoia. The world is evil and trying to destroy you.My parents have a lot of financial troubles but they give a church  of their money so it can teach them to be good people. They dont need a church to be good people.,Exittors,cg7eo5v,3,t5_2zdp4

998991,0,t1_chhm2zw,I didnt realize that SDA doctrine included OT stuff. Its one of my usual arguments with christians when they make arguments based on any OT laws. I say I thought all OT stuff was invalidated by Jesus? and they say it was...and their argument is gone. If a christian followed ALL of the OT stuff Id be more willing to say that their argument made sense within the context of their beliefs...but there are a LOT of OT rules that it sounds like SDA doesnt follow some as simple as putting tzittzit on the corners of your clothing. ,Exittors,chhucs5,2,t5_2zdp4

2232777,0,t1_cln9i4e,Im not on reddit because I expect to find my answer here. I thought Id ask what others have done  Ive reached out to all the atheists and theists in my life I thought Id reach out to those who have similar experiences with religion as myself. Ive only been able to find those people on this subreddit. Im not sitting on my computer all day. I think Im a very active person.I dont think you should feel sorry for me but damn cant you at least empathize? How do you live your life without feeling compassion for others? Of course Im sensitive  I would think most people reconstructing their entire view of the world after leaving their religious community would be sensitive.Once again Im not going to apologize for feeling depressed alone sad sensitive etc. Im not going to apologize because I think its completely natural to feel this way right now and also because I get up every day and fight it.I just thought Id try to tap into a community of other people who I assumed were also fighting. Im sorry that I was wrong.,Exittors,clnn0z6,1,t5_2zdp4

8628428,0,t1_d6k329m,Perhaps not unlike the Amish though scaled back as in all other things mainstream Mennonites present a kindlier aspect to the outside world than they deserve IMO. When I visit my parents talk is a high percentage of judgmental gossip about church people and their neighbors. Last I knew they were still Trump voters even though policywise hed do almost everything they personally disapprove of what matters most is that he feeds their sense of distrust and conspiracy.Take Southern Baptists reduce the testosterone by about  and you have the people who spawned me. Theyve become a little less culty over the last few decades settling into an unremarkable variety of American fundamentalism  still plugging their ears denying science and culture waiting patiently to die or be raptured whichever comes first.,Exittors,d6k5oyo,4,t5_2zdp4
