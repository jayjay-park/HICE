2565859,0,t3_2p4zn2,Like they said before NXT is the way in. If you get hooked on that then youll probably follow your favs to the big show then be hooked if not then NXT is the best place and easiest to learn what wrestling is about. Storylines characters and awesome entrancesAlso even if you ar ein and out while he is watching on Mondays just have a look in. Eventually youll find someone you like and latch on from there. You definitely dont need to know all the storylines up front. ,SCBackstage,cmthvkv,2,t5_321r8
