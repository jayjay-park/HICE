11079895,0,t1_denvxsz,Maybe I am misunderstanding the concept of the starwarsccg.org downloads. Are they not designed to be downloaded and printed to be played with because of the scarcity or cost of various cards? For example the intro demo decks can be downloaded printed and fully played with. Whereas the other downloads only have partial cards like the bottom half or are missing the images. How can I play with those? The instructions on the site are not quite clear to me.Now if these are not intended to be printed and played or doing so is illegal than I will have no intention of doing so.,starwarsccg,denw9px,1,t5_2sf73
11597979,0,t3_65gqtr,About two years ago I picked up my collection and started building some decks reintroduced myself to the eBay market. Luke Jedi Knight had jumped to around  however Theed and Coruscant were much cheaper than I remember.I think the Force Awakens hype got people back into the collecting and it brought out the remaining sellers and it appears theyve dumped out there remaining inventory. You can only try and sell boxes and sets for  before you just drop the price and take advantage of the increased demand.,starwarsccg,dgan11z,1,t5_2sf73
