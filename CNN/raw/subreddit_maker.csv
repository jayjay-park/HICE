290287,0,t3_1xe4u8,Have a look at Luminet FLORA Fabrick.it and LilyPad Also heres a few keywords to start off your search wearables esewingAll of the things you describe are generally possible with current tech and a lot of things are happening on this field. To put it all together and have it work flawlessly enough to work through a night of dancing and also be robust might be a challenge but i think it should be possible depending on how much time you plan to put into this. Good Luck!,maker,cfaupkv,1,t5_2r35r

6032463,0,t3_3x0wzk,This only sounds sarcastic but my mind always wants to spout something like rDIY is the new rOldSchoolCool. As a mostlymetamaker in that I currently talk about it more than I actually practice the art I usually tell people its a lot like DIY but often with more tech and fewer reasons.

7484068,0,t3_4hv3an,Hello Mr. Savage huge fan of the show. But I am a bigger fan of the model and hobby work you do. Your garden maze from the shining was amazing! But I do have a question. Are you aware of model based war gaming? IE miniature wargaming historical gaming and the like If so have you ever done any models for any of the games in these settings?,maker,d2swb2g,1,t5_2r35r
7485694,0,t3_4hv3an,So Ive recently bought an arduino and have become obsessed with this new hobby of programming different motors.  This was all sparked by your video making the auto popcorn feeder.  So thank you for that.As a beginner I have been feeling a little overwhelmed with all the circuit information.  Knowing when to use transistors relays resistors etc.  My question to you is if you have any good references or advice for someone trying to learn circuits?,maker,d2t2zdz,1,t5_2r35r
7488032,0,t1_d2tcdwm,Yeah thats fucked up for sure but Id argue that mocking someone for anything is still rude. What does effective even mean in this context?

7619408,0,t3_4jmfa6,It would be an easier project if you picked a mic that was dynamic or at least self powered via battery or something.  Then it would be a simple job of wiring on a two conductor cable with audioground.  This unit needs power usb power would work but you would have to hack the cabling to send the audio to the audio in and get power from usb.  I say try a different approach.,maker,d38acia,1,t5_2r35r

It was way outside of my field of study... But it payed the bills.I later found my passion through some volunteer work but the company dissolved before I could turn it into a paying job.Life has recently afforded me a second chance at defining myself and I havent been able to pull the trigger to pursue any of the things that make me happy... until now. I really appreciate your and everyones words of advice!Im going to see if I can make this happen!!,maker,d3yxkfj,1,t5_2r35r

8004506,0,t3_4ot0xx,I would recommend that you also try to bootstrap the effort so it stays on a solid foundation even if initial funding sources dry up. So many things like this fail because they invest in resources and business models that arent actually stable in the long run. Start in a space that you can get for free like a high school classroom. Source the parts for kits and offer them for sale on your website dont make them required for the class but make them available for interested kids. Once you have space invest twice as much into laser cutters as D printers since they always end up the workhorses of maker spaces. Find cheapfree sources of art supplies and building materials and make them available for free in the space to members. Charge a reasonable amount for membership but dont charge for training. Parents are going to be the bread and butter of membership fees so make sure they think theyre getting their moneys worth. Offer coding classes after school programming summer camps and college admission counseling for STEAM programs. Who wouldnt want to be able to have extra time to get home after work while their kid works in an awesome STEAM space that will help them find their passions and get into a college where they can do that?Marketing yourself will be one of the most important things you can do. Have pages and pages of member project pictures programming materials etc. Put great projects on display in the space to inspire others to come in every day and make. ,maker,d4fs61p,1,t5_2r35r

9639849,0,t3_5cxty2,for laser cutting find a maker space near you they probably have one. if not there are services you pay and give a cad file and they will ship you back plasma cut  laser cut parts.for soldering hakko makes amazing soldering irons that wont break the bank. i would get a  dollar amazon iron at first and see how much use you are going to get out of it... but they make you pull your hair out. I have a hakko  but the newer pre school looking irons are just as good and have digital controls which is nice.for wood working... do you have a space to cut stuff? wood working is a huge mess and not something you can do in your apartment. the tool i use most is a table saw and a coping saw. however that will change based on what you are trying to do. buy what you need when you need to... and then just kinda collect as you go. I dont have a workshop and live in an apartment so i rent a storage garage and work out of that,maker,da1b5vn,1,t5_2r35r

10238279,0,t1_dc4enfd,I think its based on a variety of factors. You need to have good equipment and the like but the people that come regularly can really have an impact too. At our TechShop the staff and members are constantly making all kinds of things to make the shop easier to use and staff are usually the people maintaining  repairing the equipment. If you employ makers who love to fix stuff that could save a lot on the cost of maintenance. Assuming they do a good job which they do at our TechShop ,maker,dc4ke2b,1,t5_2r35r
