With your real life experience you could probably plow through it in  days. If you have more time I would recommend the TESOL cert program on Coursera.  Its administered through Arizona State University and I think it is highly worth it.  I am learning far more and more deeply than I did in OnTesols program. ,TESL,d54fek4,1,t5_2qo9q
