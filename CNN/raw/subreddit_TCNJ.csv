1588545,0,t3_21v0ld,Join clubs play sports... do shit. Im on my way to being a fifthyear senior and have done nothing. Dont get me wrong I totally love this school and my major! But I really think my experience would have been way better if I was more active. Also get close with your professors specifically the ones in your major. You are going to need those connections for recommendations and they can help you get jobs because of their own connections. PM if you have any other questions! I love giving advice to freshies!,TCNJ,cjfeodb,1,t5_2scdi

3893651,0,t3_350r2c,Just take the hit and go with the random. I ended being better friends with my random freshman year roommate than I was with the guy I initially wanted to room with. ,TCNJ,cr03z3z,1,t5_2scdi
4115709,0,t3_37o6hz,If they offer Making Sense of Life for Life I would highly recommend it. There hasnt been a more meaningful learning experience in my entire life. That class was immensely life changing. That class broke open my head and picked my brain more than anything else could. Pedro the professor is incredible. My roommate and  of my floor took American Supernaturalism and loved it. Only heard good things from that class.,TCNJ,crpf0i8,2,t5_2scdi
4143593,0,t3_385rhk,If your friend isnt in the Honors program regardless of the FSP you both have chosen you still may not be rooming with him unless TCNJ Res Life have fulfilled a roommate request you submitted. Since you still are in the Honors program you still may be housed in the Honors dorm idk which building theyre using as the Honors building this year.In terms of your classes I dont actually know if you need an Honors class this semester. Email your advisor or the head of the Honors program and see if you can just take and Honors class in the spring.,TCNJ,crsl54r,4,t5_2scdi
4143646,0,t3_385rhk,Also dont worry about rooming with a stranger. You can always visit your friend easily and with a stranger you can make a nice connection for the rest of the college career. Focus on your academic and if anything you can choose your friend as a roommate sophomore year. ,TCNJ,crslcxj,6,t5_2scdi
