The only thing that might speak against your CB is the lack of ABS.  Having ABS reduces your likelihood of crashing around  which IMHO is worth it.  However that aside the CB will likely be nice and cheap.  ,NewRiders,dc4axhy,2,t5_3hdbs

11354582,0,t1_dfisro1,Yeah I wouldnt buy a helmet online that I havent tried on before especially from a brand that Ive never owned. Once youve zeroed in on what fits you though you can have a pretty good idea. For me personally I know anything Shoei has made for the last  years fits me like a glove in size L so I wouldnt have any problem just ordering online even if its a new model. ,NewRiders,dfj0rfz,1,t5_3hdbs
