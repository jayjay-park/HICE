5087913,0,t3_3kmoor,This message was the first time I have ever heard of Voat.  Its quite interesting.  Im not sure I would agree with what theyre doing but Ive only just looked at it.In generalDo you think there should be  strikes rules? Either here or there and permanent banning if the user is generally agreeable and either actively or proactively attempts to mitigate their own behavior?Should there be banning for harassment if the legal definition of harassment is not met?Should there be permanent banning at all assuming some cooperation on the part of the user Wouldnt a point system as motor vehicle departments have make more sense?Should moderators not have ultimate authority unto themselves? Wouldnt it be decent and kind and right to have a reasoned tribunal where evidence can be presented and considered and arguments made instead of if we decide to reverse our decision well get back to you?,WatchVoatDie,cuzab3b,1,t5_39ven
