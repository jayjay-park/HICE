209788,0,t1_cf2by0t,I just typed out two paragraphs explaining why this bot used to suck. Then I looked at the post I had complained about to verify that my complaints were still valid... what do you know its practically fixed. With the addition of the image to the comment it no longer completely ruins it. However the title text should be removed from the comment and made to come up when you mouse over the image. The title text is supposed to be read after the comic.,xkcd_transcriber,cf2c7gt,2,t5_2z4yk
