187432,0,t1_cezrkrw,Ahhh thats right.Well first I went into some forests near the southern coast of England spent some time with some self described hermits there learned the old art of longbow shooting.   Stayed there for a few months than I went to North Africa and traveled with a band of freelance mercenaries for a bit stayed there for the rest of that year and one more before the leader died under certain circumstances and I left.Then I went to the Chinese Federation where I met a man who took me in at my lowest and taught me things that no Western mind could teach.  For four years that man was the closest thing I had to a father again but we departed on less than friendly terms.  For a few months after that I lost myself in a brutal Thanix addiction until I was rescued by another mentor this time a replacement mother figure named Madame Akari.Despite being a woman Madame Akari was well learned in the ancient code of the Samurai.  She ran a school that taught bodyguards and manservants for the elite of the world but despite her obvious wealth she lived like a hermit in the beautiful Japanese countryside.  I found peace there and a purpose to help those I could.  I spent the rest of my time there until finally I went to Tokyo walked into the local Sawyer HQ and calmly told them who I was.,IAmAFiction,cezscwj,1,t5_2su77

247588,0,t1_cf5yuyq,Technically that is not correct the Blargonians had an inkling of our existence long before I was born. The Arecibo radio broadcast from Puerto Rico shot into space on November  had first alerted them to our presence. On my second trip into space my first trip being an unprecedented disaster I had discovered that the Blargonians had erected a small outpost on our moon quite some years ago. It is true that their aggression towards the human race was spurred by my initial presence and by my actions. Shortly after my initial presence I discovered that the Blargonians had been in the process of abducting various humans and other lifeforms for study. I use the word study with a heavy dose of sarcasm as their socalled experiments tested the individuals might and prowress in handtohand combat and how palatable human organs were to their highly developed almost epicurean sense of taste. In short while it my fault and I take full responsibility for my actions my only crime is the curiosity and bravery that comes from being a child who believes himself a hero. I have spent the past  years since then striving to correct them.

My own personal sword is easy to explain its a Tollan style katana that a fallen angel reforged for me before he infused me with the demon blooddont ask me how was able to access a Hellforge and reforge a weapon with infernal iron without dying he didnt say.Since Ive got the blood I can touch infernal iron weapons just fine. My guns arent an issue because there is nothing divine about them.  Hell even normal devil hunter sanctified weaponsbullets arent a problem even if the enchantments are derived from spells taught by fallen Angels to early humansor so my buddy Anubis claims theyve evolved so much that theyre no longer divine in nature.The really weird thing?  I can wield High Steel weapons.  As in Angel weapons.  The whole being able to lift them thing isnt weird Im strong enough now to that.  But the demon blood isnt reacting the way it should.It should burn me the way infernal iron burns humans and angelsMy angel friends have no answer.Now heres the first question.  For a while I avoided this.  It wasnt difficult in terms of physical demand.  But mentally and emotionally ohhh yes.Twenty years after I came back.  I was saved by three Angels named Izanagi Thor and Amaterasu.  Izanagi had been disgraced by something a few thousand years back.  Dont ask me why he picked methe chance of their being a lot of demons and me now being specifically bred to kill demons may have played into it but he wanted me to help him find some artifact crafted by Angels a Prison of The Void.  Apparently this particular prison was buried but found by known reclusive nutjob Peter West who promptly stored it into his private collection.  Then he died a year after finding it.  Izanagi saw retrieving this as being the way to get his status back.At first it seemed easy.  Izanagi had a habit of hanging around the mortal realm so he blessed a random person and his family every so often and disguised himself as them when he needed to hang about in public.  He used this to get into a private party being held by old man Wests nephew Cullen at the old mans house in the sleepy village of Haven. The rest of us posed as servants.  Met a couple of interesting people like noted demonologist H.P. Fearcroft and the Sovereign of the nearby city state Tollan. Cullen had a game he wanted to play.  Apparently the house was haunted.  So he told us before he had it turned into a museum if we could last a weekend there without running scared for our lives we could pick one artifact out of his collection.  It was perfect we could search the house for the Prison and if there were ghosts we were scarier than any of them.We thought it was the easiest job in the world.  We were wrong.  Very very wrong.That house wasnt just a house.  Whatever was in the Prison had turned it into something else something made of pure evil something that had caused Peter West to kill himself.  Then there was Cullen.To this day I have yet to truly figure out what he was. It was obviously not human but it wasnt demonic or divine either.  It was almost as if there was nothing there at all.  Thats it just pure emptiness no heart no soul not even a bloody body.  At first I thought it could have been a ghost a figment created out of the old mans memories but as youll see below I found out that was wrong. It started out okay Cullen showed us to our rooms and he acted perfectly normal.  The first night was also uneventful.The next morning everyone explored the house.  It was the biggest mansion in all of Purgatora and Peter West had made some very intriguing choices in designing ithe had made his fortune in architecture. so it was a blast to explore.  At first I went off alone but then I bumped into Fearcrofts assistantThats me! Lucia and then later Izanagi.  I developed something of a friendly lovehate relationship with the disgraced Angel he had known pain similar to mine so I felt a kinshipthis love hate relationship would later become full on man love. Lucia with him.But Im getting off topic.  The morning was uneventful until we found this old bat in one of the many smoking lounges dead from a heart attack.  At first we thought she had spooked but a few minutes later one of the Sovereigns aides was found obviously murdered and the only people not present when we found the body were Cullen and Fearcroft.Izanagi wanted everyone to stay together but the Sovereign had a very everyman for himself kind of mentality and we stayed splintered.  Except for us three Lucia and this Karnakian sheik named Anpu.  We decided to find Fearcroft.That was when...they attacked.I dont know how to describe them just that they were these otherworldly tentacled horrors.  We found them chasing Fearcroft but were able to dispatch them.  It was at this point that we discovered that Anpu was really a fallen Angel named Anubis something that Thor didnt like.  We also discovered that Fearcroft was a vampireLucia was his living blood bag at the time and that he had seen those things in his dreams.  The Angels also seemed quite familiar to them but I didnt press the subject.The rest of the weekend everyone else but our group was picked off one by one.  Then there was also West.  He approached me several times talked about things he couldnt possibly know.  He really got into my head made me remember the things I was guilty for.  Made me think I was a monster.In the end we found the Prison but at cost.  Fearcroft turned Lucia as his final gift to her and then stayed behind stating that he was the source of those creatures and that they would follow him forever if he didnt do the sacrifice.  So he used his vampire powers to move quickly around the house setting several fires at once and stayed behind.By the time we made it to the entrance it was already ablaze.  Everyone else got out and I took one last one look I had too....Cullen was there.  Just standing in the middle of the room no expression. The flames didnt even burn him or his clothes.  Then before I turned away there was only one change.He smiled.  It was just this smug expression that said only one thing.  I win.  Then the house started collapsing and I got the hell out of there.I didnt mention this but those doubts.  They really messed with me.  I also saw some messed up stuff upon touching the Prison stuff that caused me to distrust Izanagi and believe that what West said about me was the truth.  I punched him in the face and then went off on a hedonistic rampage for nearly two hundred years.  Until Lucia found me again and saved me.Like I said not exactly physically difficult and we were only there for the weekend.   But I still refuse to go within five hundred miles of Haven.  In fact the real reason I consider this my hardest hunt is the aftermath.  That smug thing calling itself Cullen West did what no demon or fellow man had ever done before or since.  It cost me to just give up and forget controlling the anger and hate that control my powers.  Also as for what Cullen was the truth of the matter is that I dont have a single fucking clue.  After my rageguilt bender I looked into it.  In order for ghosts to manifest a physical shape specifically a person that person had to have actually been a part of their victims memories.  Which did make sense since Cullen claimed to be the old mans nephew and his old mans memories would have been the source of the manifestation.That it is until I discovered that Peter West was an only child.  As in no brothers or sisters.  Which means that Cullen West did not even exist.  Which means that whatever that thing that stalked us that weekend was it definitely wasnt a ghost.,IAmAFiction,cklezt3,1,t5_2su77

In doing so I am inevitably going to come across as long winded. Which I can assure you I certainly am not. But since you asked here it goes.Within the walls of the colonies there are several factories that produce the necessary resources for life such as food water materials and then some. While these output mechanism operate on fairly run of the mill mechanics meets biotics technology it is their input mechanisms that represent the largest gap in the mystery that is life on Earth.

Ill separate my reply into sections so that its easier to comprehend.How did the world react to a city suddenly having a population of people with magical powers? Or does the rest of the world not know yet?They dont seem to concerned most of our stories get pushed into the tabloids and anything that could be blown out of proportion is maintained by me and my friends. I dont think the rest of the world is actually aware of us for the most part weve had people come through who freak out but they dont seem to want to verify what theyve seen with the outside world.Any main bad guys? Like ones you have to fight over and over again because theyre really strong?Yes. My nemesis is a person who calls himself The Antagonist. They have no defining features save for a handlebar mustache they constantly wreak havoc with overcomplicated pointless schemes meant to make our lives hell. Our other enemies include Santa Claus Death a deadly duo named Arrow and Ace and Trolls. They all constantly slip away from us or out of jail or are just too clever sometimes. Death is only our enemy sometimes on occasion they aid us. It all depends.Did the majority of the citizens carry about their lives as normal after the storm or has the whole city gone nuts?Most did all of the powers are somehow related to what the person is or needs or wants. I for example have two distinct personalities due to my mental condition and I feel like I exist in two different worlds. With my power I kind of do I guess. So most people have powers that magnify elements of their personality or their careers some however have powers that can be used for personal gain with malicious intent... and those are the ones who must be stopped.Do you like your power or are there any you wouldve rather gotten instead?At first I thought Id been cheated but then I realized that my power is actually really badass.

3806529,0,t1_cqq5d4n,My favourite part? That is a tricky one... But if I had to choose... my first ever successful role holds a special place in my heart. Bolka Tra was a truly fascinating character to immerse myself within  first and foremost because I was playing a woman. The love interest to the vigilante hero of I Repara Redemption Bolka spends her time throughout the play attempting to convert our protagonist from his slavetrading ways tragically losing her life in the attempt. It is this final act of hers that drives our hero Evero to better himself serving for a wonderfully profound conclusion. Bolka is likely my favourite part due to her tenacity throughout the play. It allowed me to bring a lot of energy to the stage  much to the admiration of my audience  and paved the way for my success as an actor.Ah Winter on the Ocean was something truly special. In short this tale followed the skeleton crew of a merchant vessel traversing the northwestern seas crossing from Homasia to Lichenforre. We join the crew moments before a disastrous storm lays waste to their sails leaving them adrift between two continents for the last few months of the year. Its a very meaningful play focusing on our will to survive and the fragility of our social constructs. My character  the aforementioned Freyjo Remaros  serves as an ambiguous villain in the story slowly disposing of unnecessary crew members to preserve the vessels food supply for as long as possible. This play has it all a terrifying survival situation a tragic love story a fantastic villain if I do say so myself and brutal social commentary. The play concludes with Freyjo and the ships captain  Oxfarios  battling to the death aboard the deck with the corpses of their crew surrounding them. After a pulsepounding piece of stage combat Freyjo ultimately succumbs having his eponymous hand cut from his body and left to bleed to death. As a fellow vessel approaches to rescue the two the crew witness Oxfarios brutality toward Freyjo and assume the corpses to be his doing also. Fearing for their lives they turn and flee leaving the captain to his fate. The play concludes with Oxfario on his knees with the mutilated Remaros before him and snow beginning to fall upon the deck. I must say if I ever get the opportunity to return to theatre I will most surely take it.,IAmAFiction,cqq6ah0,1,t5_2su77
3873852,0,t1_cqvow41,We have representatives all over the continent. A person who is willing to join us shows what talents they have to them and if the representative finds them worthy he sends them to our fortress where he is put into some kind of test. If he passes it we make a small ceremony where we read his memories to know him better and to make sure that he has no bad intentions. In one case a man was sent here with the intention of killing as many as our brothers. He had made a pact with a demon. If everything is allright we assign him to the division where his talents fit in best.As our enemies are diverse our method of eliminating them varies too. The blade staff is our traditional weapon but usually our fighters go with their own favorite weapons. Of course sometimes you need a specific weapon. A sword wont do anything against a stone golem but a hammer can change things. Crossbow is mostly the choice when it comes to ranged weaponry. We have special teams whose members are individuals who have somehow formed a pact with a spirit or some astral being granting themselves useful powers such as the ability to turn invisible or throw fireballs. We use those teams for assassination reconaissance artillery and so on.We the nightmare eaters have our own minds as weapons attacking our opponents brain with our wildly flowing psychic powers. I have to admit though we are unreliable on the battlefield as we require deep concentration for our powers to be undisturbed and effective.

As a result of action from the Feds an independence movement was formed. However the governor of Hawaii decided to silence it and deployed the National Guard. One day the National Guard opened fire upon protestors killing at least a thousand. The Muteki Daitai PMC caught wind of this and sent a massive contingent of troops to invade Hawaii.

5611271,0,t1_cwrw42a,gt We work with all sorts of companiesInteresting!  Youre the middle man with a scoop of value on top.gt I think also because they wanted it to be true.Isnt there a tenet of Christianity that forbids worshipping other gods?  Has that as far as you can remember affected them?  I find it interesting that they chose their truth which then requires faith to further.  Theres a larger topic Im trying to dig at here but Im not sure how to phrase it.What do you mean by the secret?gt So youre older than Wicca...Theres little that puts your age in perspective than being told you are older than religion even if its not that old.  Id need quite a large cake to fit the appropriate amount of candles.  If anyone made me a cake.  If I ate.Its fairly similar.  Given the similarities and order of their evolution I suspect Wicca is a child of what I follow.  I call it Wicca for ease of explanation not that it makes it easier to explain but I find eyebrows arch closer to the ceiling when I say Im practice Witchcraft vs I practice Wicca.  I suppose its a moot point given both words are used in Wicca but.. Anyway.I believe in the duality of the mother and father  lord and lady  Goddess and Horned God but I was taught to focus on closer spiritsgods to us.  In that sense it is hybridized paganism and witchcraft I suppose.  I say spiritsgods as one item because theyre a fairly close concept.  Every living being has a spirit.  Or soul.  Different term for the same item.  I believe that certain spirits are stronger than others and the very strongest might be considered gods.  In that sense there can be more than one god of churned butter if butter had a soul.  When I pray and practice I invoke these gods if my goals are related to their domain.  I invoke the motherfather in more rare scenarios when praying FOR something.  If Im simply paying a thanks its fine.  They arent vengeful but I believe its selfish rude and frankly out of place for me to ask directly of the highest gods unless the need is dire. Maybe thats why I am what I am.  I wasnt exactly nice when I asked for my mothers health over and over.  Demanded really.  Rule number one of everything know your place.Or maybe Im now considered one if those special souls.  Huh. Theres a new thought.  If I dont answer you tomorrow I was smote for my hubris. Well that was a mouthful.  Did I explain it well? Happy to answer more!For all you said about my thousand questions about Christianity thank you! the Christian deity sounds scary.  I would fear doing wrong whereas my father appears more..fatherly?  He is stern when it is required but for the most part its a very respect the other creatures and you have my respect sort of relationship.  God forbid I had premarital sex and was christian.  Pun  intended. A curious thought just came to mind.  You said you once believed that the pagan gods had been relatively inactive for a thousand years and that the christian god was very active.  Christianity is around two thousand years old.  How do you console the fact that the world and her creatures are significantly older?  An even larger question given that you said you felt the pagan gods were inactive and you felt this while a devout christian did you believe that both your god and their gods existed and that one cared for us more than the others pagans?gt but is woefully immoral by modern standards.Im surprised religion hasnt evolved to accommodate this.  Perhaps Im being reactionary and short sighted but isnt devout following of iron age standards how we get chaos such as what is currently going on in Israel?  I have seen many more attacks between locals in the last few months than in a long time.  I suppose the general terror climate would be another example.I have heard if Bahai!  They leave room for improvement so to speak and I think that is the most insightful thing a religion has ever done.  Buddhism has philosophies that align well with how I choose to live my life.  Im not familiar with Sikhism.Jovian? TlDr? gt Perhaps we all just assumed that of course you drizzle the blood of babies into your morning coffee and moved onto the interesting stuff. Im glad that at least one person looked beyond the monster and into the human soul behind the eyes.  It means a lot.gt Chaos TheoryIts so hard to predict what can happen.  As you illustrated positive actions can beget negative effects good even if unintended and vice versa.  I like to think that theyre somewhat correlated though.  Youll never know if holding a door for someone ends up with a ten car pile up but you can feel relatively safe assuming it will add a small spark of brightness to their day.  Speaking of unintended consequences.. Will tell you this after answering the rest of this. gt Is that healthy for you? Does life from those who are dying or want to die not sustain you as well?I wouldnt go so far as to say its unhealthy but the quality does correlate with the life and emotion of the host.  When I feed some of who I take from enters me.  Some lore has dabbled in the transfer of memories knowledge or vision.  My reality isnt quite so advanced but I can feel twinges of what theyre feeling emotionally.  I took from an elderly man last week.  He was a child during World War II and one of his biggest regrets was the not being old enough to contribute.  The guilt stemmed from the loss of his father who was taken from this world about a year before the end.  I had known and been talking with this man for weeks.  He had a good life a wife kids decent income.  He was happy overall but you could see the shadow of this regret in his face through it all.  Do you ever blame yourself for something you couldnt physically have changed?Well when I took from him you know what I felt?  At first bits of that guilt.  As his life began to wane as was part of our agreement he transitioned more and more toward peace.  He made his peace with God he was catholic.The effect feels more profound with those who know they will die soon.  Perhaps its a psychological effect on my part or perhaps its due to the usually quiet setting those people are in.  I like to think that the stories they tell set the mood and it helps me attune more closely to them but Im a romantic at heart.When someone dies while under my embrace I personally dislike the term but it fits I really feel it because it is all I feel.  Imagine being powerfully connected to someone  a parent a lover a child  and then theyre gone.  I feel frigid and begin to shiver.  I feel a void in my chest that feels like I was kicked and had my heart removed.  Its like half of my own soul just vanishes.  The only thing I can do is cry and wait for it to stop and yet I intentionally do it every time I help someone pass.  I need to feel their departure.  I even mourn.  Maybe that need is because I actually begin to care after hearing their stories  and I really do care for them.  Maybe Im lying to myself and I need to validate my own humanity.  Maybe you can analyze the heartdump I just gave you and give me your honest perspective.  Did I answer your question?  I started out that way but I got a bit emotional and entered story telling mode.Okay.. Sorry if that got a bit depressing.  Time for a happy story!  Would you believe Im out of the country for a few days?!  A few paragraphs ago I mentioned unintended consequences.  Well one happened to me!  My roommate was intended to go away with his girlfriend but TLDR they had a large falling out and he was then saddled with two tickets airfare and a spot in the tropics.  He offered me her half of the deal for the price of the airfare and I took it!  In all my life I have never been on a plane and Ive never been here! It was such an amazing experience to be miles above the earths surface watching people and eventually houses turn into tiny dots then reappear as we got closer.  It really felt a bit of what we were talking about around the Blue Marble and how petty we all seem from so high.I may not be bursting into flame but I was a little worried about the sun making me uncomfortable.  It isnt so bad so far!  I have become a natural shade hunter.  Part of it feels as if Ive been launched back in time.  You know I have seen this many stars at night in so so so long.  Its such a humbling experience to see them in all their unlightpolluted glory.  I even made a new friend!  Well four really.  Apparently stray cats are fairly common on the island.  When I looked down from the stars I noticed one sitting on the sand a few feet away  a kitten that couldnt have been more than three months old.  A few more wandered over in the next few minutes.  There were four in total but no mother.  My roommate  lets make him human by give him a name Matt  thought I was crazy for handling them.  Rabies etc.  He doesnt know I dont need to worry about that but thats our secret.  I may be rambling on about things that seem pretty common but it has been such an incredible humbling experience and I am so grateful.  I hope you dont mind my off topic stories.  Youre becoming more a penpal than AMA participant.I wasnt able to prefeed for the trip as it was last minute so well see how that gets handled.

I suppose a lot of teens are too young to know that movie.  Thats too bad to hear about the kittens mom but Im glad theyre old enough to make their own way now. gt More of a garden fence really but still enough that I realize I never had a real conversation with him until that night. He has been upgraded to friendapplicant.Do you think Matt feels the same way? Was he satisfied with it being just a casual roommate acquaintance before? If hes coming off a breakup into a pleasant vacation with you where a friendship has become to blossom do you think he might start looking for a further relationship?gt Isnt it funny how things come full circle?! I was looking through some of their videos and this  is a cover of this ! I was in tears watching this .Thats funny. When I saw the link was for Hysteria for a brief moment I was expecting this instead. Earlier when you linked me to the Cello Song I briefly expected this  I suppose were all a product of our times to some degree. gt but that Cello D string...Im not enough of a musician to be sure but is that the low note? The one that gets you right in the gut and makes it vibrate sympathetically? If so I agree!gt Laugh at me all you want for sending you a vampire movie to watchI havent seen Byzantium! Ive fallen badly off the bandwagon of watching all the vampire movies. Somewhere around Let the Right One In I think I knew I was never going to catch up again. The soundtrack to the movie is lovely and kind of ominous. Ill have to see if I can sort it into my towatch list somehow. That just keeps on getting longer and longer and it seems like nothing every comes off of it. I look forward to hearing how you enjoyed it!gt Its a mix of what I can only describe as a rattlesnakes tail and flowing sand and the mere sound makes my throat hurt. Okay this was a bad idea while Im actually thirsty.Why does that sound in particular set you off?gt It sexualizes one vampire but it is the only piece of art I have ever seen that does it without offending me in some fashionWhat is it about sexualizing them that bothers you? I have my own feelings on the matter but Ill hold off on expressing those so as not to muddy the water.gt Have you ever seen Pans Labrynth?I have seen it actually. I even have the DVD even though its never been opened. I think about it fairly often and a lot of the film was wonderful but there were parts that were a bit too gory for me. Im okay with blood and gore in the real world well not okay with them but I can manage them and in written work and conceptually but theres this place that movies sometimes take it to and oddly its not the actual gore or blood but some sort of body integrity thing that can make me really unhappily queasy or even pass out. Pans Labyrinth is definitely in that category. I find myself strangely fascinated to that kind of thing  body horror anatomyphysiology predation... all aspects of it!  but at the same time its too much for me.gt let me know what you thought of the story a childs dream or a fantasy come to life?I think this may touch on one of our earlier conversations a bit I suspect that the intention in the movie or at least by del Toro was that there is no difference between the two. The line between dream and real life is not strictly defined like an impassable ravine but the fuzzy boundary of an empty field that is just conventionally considered a nomans land. So it both simultaneously did and didnt happen. It couldnt happen because its impossible and it must have happened because of the effects it had on the protagonist. If that makes any sense.gt However Im not sure she knows what shes trying to be  because she seems like shes trying to be everything. At one point I watched what appeared to be twerking in a metal bikini while flailing her pink ponytail around and in other scenes shes completely different. Maybe you can explain it to me.Oh definitely. I read her Wikipedia entry once and I think at least when that song was produced she was still a precocious teenager. Id be more suspicious of a teenager who wasnt that way to be honest.   I attribute it to an open mind that is ignoring boundaries that she believes to be mere social constructs. gt I love music and movies and stories that rip my heart in various directions and can evoke tears happy or sad. Perhaps you have a more exciting emotional life than I do. I suspect you might be in the majority there. Or at least I know my wife and several of my sisters feel the same way and they certainly havent had a less dramatic life than I. Perhaps their emotions are just better stretched than mine.gt On a similar vein I love being frightened.For the most part so do they where once again I avoid it. My fight or flight mechanism is pretty feisty. Even silly horrorthriller movies  obvious movies  I cant really watch in the theater because if I get too involved in it I start becoming combatitive.  Jumping from a plane is something Id really love to do and swimming with the sharks sounds really fun. I love haunted houses too  but I dont really think of those things as scary really. Perhaps they are and Im just mislabeling them. I guess theyre not scary because I know that theyre relatively safe or they wouldnt be offered as an activity? Obviously theres danger involved but just driving down the street is dangerous  its an acceptable insurable in the box danger. Somehow a movie is scarier because if I really get into it I suspend disbelief and that safety net isnt there. gt have you heard of McKamey Manor?I dont know to be honest if Ive heard of that one or not  Ive read about a few of the noholdsbarred terrifying ones. They might cross that line into the suspension of disbelief so as fun as it might be to find out it would probably be stupid for me to ever try. Id hateregret forever to be one of those guys who goes into a haunted house and ends up punching someone. I probably wouldnt  its not like I have some lengthy history of getting into brawls or anything  but at least in part thats because I try to avoid circumstances where that could happen. I love the costumes though the sets the characters people get into and the lengths people go to suspend disbelief. I love love love that sort of thing. Its whats best about Halloween in my opinion.gt MUSIC!Okay so thats not really a quote but Im supposed to give a few back right? More of the soundtrack theme!Everybodys watched Fifth Element right? and so everyone probably remembers the Diva Dance  which apparently features music from Lucia di Lammermoor. But the whole soundtrack is filled with little gems which admittedly might be colored by my feelings toward the movie and Ive always been really fond of the little pop song in the end credits that the composer snuck in Little Light of LoveAnd of course you have the really famous soundtrack songs like this  or this  but what about Liza Gerrard I love her  she was the best in Dead can dance too with Broken from The Insider  or Elysium from Gladiator  Peter Gabriels entire soundtrack to Passion of the Christ is worth a listen but especially Different Drum  And this is a weird one because even though I have it as an MP I can never find it as an isolated soundtrack to share but SantiU from Macross Plus  is a song Im always excited to hear come up in rotation.Okay now where were we...gt All that being said I can smell a little stronger than in my human years. In fact most senses are a different. Ive explained taste and I can get into the others if youd like.Sure Id love to hear about it. Are they stronger more acute or different? Many creatures can see into different ranges of color or see different qualities of color in the same range we can same with hearing. But smell and taste are a different beast arent they?

Once I did pass I woke up in an alleyway in the city belonging to the Vale what people called the afterlife down there Black Vale the Damned CityVale the Condemned ValeLand. There was no pain when I woke up. gtDo you remember everything from before you died?Yeah my memory stayed the same.gtDid you come back or were you brought back?I dont know. I think it was just me. I came back with a woman named Evelyn. She was entrusted with the gate back to guard it. She didnt know she was just told of the possible consequences should anyone try to come back. She had been the guardian for hundreds of years since you dont age down there so shes learned a good bit in her time down there. She told me that no one had left in the hundreds of years shed spent down there and that I had been the first to do it. She told me this after the fact after she tried to stop me after we fought but since I had been the first according to her knowledge she believes a higher power helped me. My ego might be getting in the way but I dont believe it. ,IAmAFiction,ddgvzlh,1,t5_2su77
