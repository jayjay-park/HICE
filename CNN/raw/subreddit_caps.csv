653884,0,t1_cgel5sz,Wow. Take a step back from the internet and calm down man. Maybe take a few days off. Looking at the bright side and hoping the team loses are two different concepts that you have completely mixed together. I would never wish or hope that the players were intentionally losing games. All I said was that some people try to look on the bright side of losing which is the FACT that your draft position is improved the lower your team finishes.There are franchises in every major sport in the US that are stuck in mediocrity because they are bubble playoff teams that cant acquire the necessary talent because thyre too close to the cap. The only chance those teams have of improving is to either A fire sale the team and rebuild or B Get a lowcost gem in the draft.Another thing to consider as far as the Caps are concerned is the defense. Clearly either Calle is not doing a good job or the talent is not there. If the Caps make the playoffs this season its highly unlikely any changes will be made to the coaching staff. It also becomes more unlikely they are able to get the talent needed on defense because they will be drafting below most of the instant impact type players. You can get all worked up and make retarded dares to strangers on the internet all youd like but its perfectly okay for FANS to see the bright side of acquiring a higher draft choice should the players fall short. And FWIW there were thousands of very vocal Avs fans who were all over HFBoardsRedditetc talking about how bad they hoped to keep losing to lock of Mackinnon. And their other top prospects.,caps,cgelh7x,1,t5_2rouz

1087751,0,t1_chrx1dz,Ill see if I can dig up some hard numbers on it  but I specifically paired them because of how well they actually played together at the beginning of the season. Schmidt and Green had great chemistry and as a pairing directed more shots for than against. While actual offensive stats and things like  yuck dont reflect posession numbers stuff like Corsi For does and as a pairing they did very very well. EDIT I totally understand if this is hard to read but the gist of it is that when Mike Green and Nate Schmidt were paired together of all shots taken between us and the opposition Corsi For  of them were by the Caps. Of all goals scored by either us or the opposition  were scored by the Caps. When Mike Green and Nate Schmidt are together the puck is usually traveling in the right direction. Greens next best partner was Dmitry Orlov with a Corsi For of  but only  of Goals Scored. All of this is at Even Strength which in my opinion was the Caps biggest weakness this year. ,caps,chrxhn8,1,t5_2rouz

Did he get traded off someplace? Hes a great and skilled player for his price tag and still has a lot more to offer imo. Hes also our bruin killer and has been consistently clutch in OT.  Oleksy gt Komisarek imo. Oleksy Not only comes dam cheap but hes home grown and has more drive to be in the big leagues that just about anyone we could trade for. The kid has does and will BLEED for the Caps. No reason to trade for what we already have. Hes also a fan favorite. You cant ask for a more loyal and willing player.  Theres also no need to send beagle down because because is a GREAT C. Hes hard on the puck plays with grit and rarely if ever makes noteworthy mistakes on the th line. Hes just about the perfect defensive C. No reason to replace him. If we waive him to Hershey someone else pitts etc will grab him in an instant. Why risk losing him just to bring in someone who does his job the same or not even as well as he does?   Downie is an interesting signing and would indeed provide what you mentioned but i dont know that we really need a glove dropper. If you keep Fehr he can easily replace Downie with better scoring upside. And if we bring up Oleksy that gives us Oleksy Wilson and chimmers as our facepunchers.  is plenty for any team.  Waiving Volpatti is a must and whether someone claims him or not hes dead weight and needs to go. ,caps,chv582j,4,t5_2rouz

1355716,0,t1_cim6omv,Like I said earlier we dont have a very good history of supporting offensive defenseman.  Green was asked to handle too much responsibility too soon in his career.  For a guy like Green to continue to be successful we need to have a skullcrusher or a true shutdown guy backing him up on the blue line.Elite defenseman take  or more solid NHL years to truly develop and Carlson shows some serious potential.  Dont get me wrong I am sick of seeing All Star Dmen leaving this city and winning Cups with other teams.I like the aggressiveness the front office is showing however this is a money year all around the league due to the potential cap raise next year.The Caps are still in a very unfriendly spot.  We waited way too long on resolving the Defense issue we are once again working with a new head coach we have a superstar that deserves support by getting players that alleviate some pressure a goalie that is hopefully maturing and not going to be consistently erratic a new GM that wants to prove he means business a delusional owner so on and so on. ,caps,cim8a49,1,t5_2rouz
1359913,0,t3_29m3k5,I think theyll continue to develop and I think this is part of what GMBM had in mind when he said we needed to recommit to player development and the farm team.

1361274,0,t1_cimm20o,Right I know we cant just make assumptions. I actually think we wont have a st nd rd pair or whatnot. Trotz liked to balance things on the forwards and defence in Nash other than Weber of course. I think the minutes will be distributed more along the lines of A B and then the last  defenceman with  mins less.But from what I know about Orpik hed be better off not leading Dmen in minutes. Hes getting old we need to pace him.,caps,cimxbs1,1,t5_2rouz
1383427,0,t1_cipnn0k,Ironically I think Bleacher Report actually nailed it this time.  It is a risky pick up.  He is old and the contract is long and expensive we all agree that those are obvious negatives.  However when it comes to Orpik himself and his talent level I am not convinced that it is that obvious that he is a good or bad pick up.  If we needed him to step in and be a dominant first pairing dman then I think we would be disappointed.  However I think there is a decent chance he could competently fill a hole weve had on our second pairing for years.,caps,cipp2gv,3,t5_2rouz

You then went on to start this reply with Im not saying the team doesnt have bigger issues but... followed later by the big issue here is that we dont have a good backup goalie so now Im just confused since youre saying the same thing just wording it differently. Either way this has nothing to do with the other things that you mentioned which I believe are far far more important to the playoff success of this team  which is all that matters at the end of the day right?Barry Trotz knows what hes doing and he is not going to run Holtby into the ground. Thats exactly why hes starting our weak backup for a big Sunday game against a very strong opponent. Oddly enough most of the people that are on this rah rah its all Peters fault bandwagon right now are screaming for Holtby to start every game so its refreshing that someone understands this is not practical or smart. We just disagree on how big of a problem this is  Im not denying that we need an upgrade at that position. Im just not losing sleep over it and I have faith in Trotzs decision making.

3034155,0,t3_2ux62q,. Stubhub. Plenty of fastfood or sitdown places around the Verizon Center. Chinatown has plenty to offer you in that aspect. Just google restaurants around Verizon Center and that could give you a better idea than me naming off places. . Best stop is Gallery PlaceChinatown because its literally right next to the Verizon Center. Chinatown is a really cool place to hang around if you have hours to spare before the game. I would really recommend going into the VC at  pm because you can go down to the  level area and watch players warm up or catch Holtby doing his pregame routine.

3759150,0,t1_cqkrgbp,Your opinion on ice hockey officiating speaks for itself.  However if it makes you happy to imagine a world where the referees just call the rulebook well who am I to judge?  After all I wouldnt deny a kitten that is happy playing with a ball of string.    Heres my suggestion Early next fall go see a mite game officiated by a rookie official.  There are more than a dozen rinks in the greater Washington DC area and each has a set of teams.  Keep an eye on The CBHL website and when you see games scheduled go see one.  Youll see what happens when a brandnew official gets on the ice with little kids and does his best to call every little thing he sees.  If hes lucky it only takes him or her a few more games to figure out that these little players arent out to rule the world and maybe he should back off and let the game call itself.    Officials have to learn to adapt to each level of game and call only the penalties that the game requires.    I would have suggested you go and try out to be a SHOA ref yourself but I doubt you could pass the question openbook test.,caps,cqkrr3t,-27,t5_2rouz

Rangers are up  goals at this point Backstrom couldve blasted him into the parking lot and chopped his head off Caps still wouldve only had  goal.  Never understood the mentality of teams that drop a game or an OT game  goal or something similar and blame that one call that couldve changed it all.  No because you didnt execute like  times prior so no that just happened to be a call that didnt go your way.  How many chances in that nd and rd period did they have?  There had to be like  plays where pucks were just laying in the crease and they couldnt pop one.  But nope it was that hit.  Right there. ,caps,cqv3tjo,6,t5_2rouz

3958670,0,t1_cr5437a,gt Lets talk about our positives our rd period was pretty stellar towards the end. No doubt if we played  minutes of that its a different game.If you want some intel from NYR keep reading.  If not you can go on your way.The Penguins subreddit was saying the same thing for a lot of their series too.  Its a common theme of teams playing against NYR which should tell you it has more to do with NYR than with your particular squads effort.  Our defense is predicated on puck control and territorial control.  They focus on stopping the puck carrier from gaining the zone andor recovering the dumpin.  If you do beat NYR to the dumpin youre going to get double teamed which means youll probably lose the puck.  And Lundqvist has good rebound control so putting a shot on net without having established in NYRs zone isnt going to do you much good.  Thats why a lot of breakins to NYRs zone are oneanddone.NYRs biggest weakness and its glaring is that we dont do well against an aggressive forecheck.  At all.  Normally when teams ramp up the pressure when theyre down late they look better than the team theyre trying to tie up.  When teams do this against the Rangers they look like an NHL squad playing a farm team.  Its not even close.  Add in that Lundqvists biggest problem is playing through traffic and you can see why the last  minutes of the game looked different from the first .  Its how you look against NYR when you exploit their main weakness versus when youre playing any other way.If the footspeed that the Caps played with in the final  minutes of Game  can be maintained for a full  then theres no question about the outcome of Game .  Itll be a blowout for the record books.  But if they could maintain that kind of footspeed for  minutes I doubt theyd be arbitrarily holding back.  Your teams not lazy and finishing us off in four games would have given you a full week to rest up.  Of course I generally believe that the notion of always giving  sounds nice at leadership conferences at a Holiday Inn meeting room but is ludicrously unrealistic in the real world.  Sixty minutes of hockey is a marathon.  Marathoners dont sprint as did the Caps in the last  of Game .  If any team comes out of the gate at maximum throttle and tries to maintain that the entire game half the squad will be in cardiac arrest by the second intermission.If Im Trotz what Im seeing is how effective the aggressive forecheck with footspeed was and changing up the script.  Come out of the gate like that and build up a  goal lead in the first.  That forces NYR into a more aggressive game which isnt our forte and opens the game more up for you.Anyway thanks for stopping by.,caps,cr7isxk,2,t5_2rouz

It drives me nuts that we have the leagues best goal scorer but havent been able to get past the nd round in forever. Its frustrating and sad to see another early exit especially because it felt like the style we were playing was the style that beat us in the Boudreau era. What do we have to do to catch a break?

Probably home since I love being able to rewind plays on DVRgt Whats your favorite ice cream flavor and why does it remind you of Jay Beagle?Chocolate  its not fancy its not going to make anyones jaw drop but it gets the job done dammit. also its our lord and savior... praise Jaysusgt What do you think the keys to the game are going to be?special teams especially the PP needs to step up. Holtby needs help in front  no more  shot periods. Get the puck through the neutral zone and maintain Ozone time we couldnt put together any kind of sustained attack against SJ.

Then we could get two linesmen off the ice so theyre not constantly interfering with play.

7138618,0,t3_4dbyxo,No hes still young. I think his perception as a bust is largely driven by the fact that he was taken four spots behind Forsberg. The Caps came away from that draft looking like huge winners and we were all excited about the future. Then GMGM went and did that awful thing he never ever should have done and all of that optimism turned to disappointment. Wilson has to play in the shadow of that disappointment. Hes always under a microscope and nothing good he ever does short of becoming a superstar will ever erase the bitter memory of the Forsberg trade which he is a constant reminder of. ,caps,d1pl0jy,5,t5_2rouz

I just think that theres more doom and gloomers than blindly optimistic people.I think its wrong to just claim that were still number  were the best at everything were going to the cups. I understand that.  I honestly think that there are people who only look at standings. I mean you can use that argument for a few of the games. But everything we lose you cant just proclaim that the other team was fighting for a playoff spot so its okay that we lost. I think you make a valid point.The last game we played against the Islanders we should won that game. My personal contention is that Holtby is the reason we lost. I think an elite goaltender needs to make those two savesplay the puck correctly on the first  goals. I think its definitely possible that we win  out of the  next games especially since we usually follow up a loss with a win. I mean I want Holtby to break that record. But Im not going to cry myself to sleep if he doesnt especially since he squandered a chance to tie last night. I think youre right. Were the best team in the league that has recent struggles that need to be figured out quickly. ,caps,d1sffa1,1,t5_2rouz

Hes an upgrade over Chimera in my mind but he wont turn the rd line into the offensive line BMac wants.

Our gameplay was stale for the better half of the last part of the season and he waited until the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs to sit guys for missed assignments poor play etc. Im no NHL coach and I get we were handcuffed by Orpiks suspension and Pitts speed but adjustments made to play or sit ChorneyWeberOrpikOrlov never worked in our favor.

Varlamov Neuvirth Holtby and Grubauer are all examples of excellent in house development. At the time when the Caps drafted Samsonov I wasnt happy with using a first round pick on a goalie but I trust whoever is scouting goalies to make the right decision. Combine that with Vanecek playing fairly well I think the Caps will be set in goal for quite sometime. Plus Copley was used to finagle Oshie over to DC too so thats another bright spot.

10653367,0,t1_ddeseps,First off what Caps money woes are you talking about?He will make the same money and get the same contract basically no matter where he signs whether its this offseason or next even as a UFA. As a UFA he still needs to sign an ELC. Hell get the chance to start one year earlier if he signs this offseason with a nice fat signing bonus to boot. And the Caps will offer that to him. Look what they did for Sanford and Gersich is very similar to Sanford. Theyll do the same for him. Its to his advantage to sign with the Caps and his stock likely only gets hurt by returning for a Senior Year. This isnt a Jimmy Vesey caliber player. ,caps,ddet9ss,8,t5_2rouz

As always the playoff results will be how we judge the season. If it means Ovi has a down year and we win it all who cares? But if we are struggling and we cant get him rolling when the time comes then of course we need to fix something. But I agree something seems off with him this season.

The Rangers have repeatedly come back from  deficits...and before you mention it was against the Caps dont forget they did it against the Penguins too. Flyers came back from  over the Bruins Kings  over the Sharks the list goes on and on. So  isnt anything to cry about. Hockey is a funny game like that. You can trail in a series and storm back and retake momentum. And thats exactly what has to be done Wednesday. Blank slate. Take control Wednesday. And play D please! If you can take a  win tomorrow all the worrying and freaking out goes away. The Caps have a favorable situation going into game  at home. This series can change in a heartbeat in the Caps favor.

11774927,0,t1_dgupe96,. Chorney is slightly better. Hes slightly faster doesnt take a ton of chances and has better positioning. Perfect partner for Shatty who can take risks and create chances.. I wish we could too but youre right they arent ready.. I honestly dont think Trotz has pumped the guys up. I give Trotz a C  so far. My main issues are that he continues to play Orpik and give him a lot of ice time that he deploys OrpikShatty with the st line thus creating sustained defensive zone time and that he wont bench veteran players no matter how many mistakes they make or how many times they lose us a game.. I love the effort of the team. Our forwards played great. The st and nd pairings played great. Holtby made great save. Orpik did nothing positive for the team once. Not fucking once.,caps,dguq1hp,2,t5_2rouz
11775078,0,t3_680c4i,I know Holts had some big saves but goals  and  went through him and goal  was in his glove and then back out into the low slot. Obviously the d hung him out to dry but in this series we need him to make those saves. Shitt is just too opportunistic and we need him to bail us out,caps,dguqnui,4,t5_2rouz
