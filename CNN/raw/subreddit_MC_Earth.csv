1560099,0,t1_cjbmkt0,No not really. I do not want to be very involved since i dont have the time to spare. If i had the time to spare id rather work on refining my own version   Ultimately im also sceptical about team based earth creation. Maybe if you were to cut up the projects in continents and give one person the responsibility to make one continent you might be able to achieve intracontinental coherence. Youll notice that the further you go in detail converting the earth to minecraft will require a lot of creative decisions. Based on my experiences with teams amp communication in such teams this would be a butthurt. Far to much data to communicate and inadvertently revisions which will halt meaningful progress.    Id be interesting to see if you can carry such an ambitious project. It would be really great if you can i really wish you the best of luck. But im sceptical by nature which is only amplified by my educational and profesional experience. If you dig around you might find other  initiatives try to analyse what they got stuck on and dont make their mistakes ,MC_Earth,cjbty1c,1,t5_32skx
