Next time someone tells you you just need more faith  ask them if faith will help keep their cholesterol low or replace insulin or any number of other things we commonly take medication for.,CMH,ci10npt,5,t5_31ubo

2940810,0,t3_2ttnw8,I feel like I complain about it a lot but the urge to cut is just ridiculous today. Its all I can think about. Its been so long since Ive given in and done it but I think today Im going to blow it. I keep trying to find distractions for myself but nothing is working. Im just exhausted in every way and have very little energy to fight against it.,CMH,co2dsm4,3,t5_31ubo

You are suffering and you should absolutely not go through this alone. You did not mention a church or campus ministry for yourself. If you were a partof a church there should be a pastor you could speak with. Secondly sty connected to the means of grace. God has provided prayer and His Word as ways of strengthening our faith and deepening our relationship with him. Thirdly biblical counseling is absolutely helpful! Consider cognitive behaviour therapy used by many psychiatrists  mine did!  years and am MUCH healthier!. It requires you to replace false beliefs with true ones. Well you know what? Memorizing Gods Word can change our mind and our behaviour. How many times does God tell us to trust him? Not be afraid? Not be anxious? Pretty much anytime God speaks. You dont need a Christian counselor if you put in the work yourself. But if you are not ready for the above steps I really recommend scary close by Donald Miller also I think you might benefit from his book  Searching for God Knows What. Also look up a man named Paul David Tripp. His Christian counseling material has really changed me. His blog is excellent. PM for more help if you need it. God bless.,CMH,cve85ii,1,t5_31ubo
