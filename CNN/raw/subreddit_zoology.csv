207420,0,t1_cf225ua,I would imagine its something along those lines.  Based on the way the lip curls on both sides of that wall between the inner and outer cavities I have to assume it was a tumor of some sort.  I dont think it grew from the outside in so I assume the tumor originated in the sinus cavity and just slowly bored its way to the surface eating everything it came across along the way.   Something had to be occupying the space in that inner hole and putting constant pressure on the surrounding bone to make the edges of the hole flatten out and develop that curved ridge.  Its like it was pried open very slowly.Maybe theres some clues that suggest a particular disease.  Id love to be able to name it instead of just saying Im no expert but it looks like face cancer.,zoology,cf22h79,2,t5_2sn8c

1079843,0,t3_25jp3e,Very interesting and good concept. But I think it needs a little more work and maybe some more known animals. Not like cow and pigs but like wolverine As you had antelope or jaguar. Like to know the different between our cats. I think that would target a bigger audience. You could also make the map like ecosystems. Just my thought tho. ,zoology,chr14pt,1,t5_2sn8c

5111373,0,t3_3kmgi7,Heres some perspective. I work with rattlesnakes in the wild and otherwise. I get several requests each week sometimes more than once per day for someone to come along on a field trip or to come see the collection help with this or that etc. I imagine that a lot of these people have the same sort of situation. Dont misinterpret busy for being a jerk ... sometimes Ill have only a single day or two to get gear together charged and cleaned from one trip before starting the next. A lot of things fall by the wayside. The several could I tag along to see XXX emails that show up every week usually get answered hastily at a gas station or with any luck a bar of service while Im sitting on a rock for the th hour in a row waiting for something to happen. Being a volunteer in the field isnt always helpful either. Depending on the work being done too having an extra set of untrained boots in habitat or even knowing the location can ruin everything. Ive seen some truly amazing sites become completely destroyed by grad students that dont understand that an observation site isnt a siteseeing area for future visits by themselves and curious friends. Im not saying that this is what youd do but that sort of thing is definitely a concern. The best way to protect the integrity of a site is to just not show anyone.Dont be discouraged and I really think theyre not jerks. I think that your offer to volunteer though genuine of course isnt as helpful as you think it might be and could even be destructive. Youre also probably not the only person asking those questions.The guy responded without even reading my email telling me that I should not be working with live snakes and refused to answer all of my questions telling me to just do my research after spending days of researching this really pissed me off as I had hoped hed be a good resource to help me find my answers. What reason or right do you have to be pissed off that he didnt have all the answers for you?,zoology,cv241hy,6,t5_2sn8c

7170921,0,t3_4dpg5f,I personally like the Anglerfish.One they are deep sea fish that are bioluminescent which is radTwo their mating bavior is bizarre. Males mission in life is to find a female. Their smell and sight suck and are just roaming around trying to not die. Its hard to find mates but when the male finds her he bites her body then releases an enzyme that allows his mouth to dissolve onto her. He then difuses all of his body onto her but still has functioning reproductive organs. He lives as long as she does. A female can have more than  males in her.Threetheir teeth are gnarly as shit and look creepy as hell.,zoology,d1t9ljk,9,t5_2sn8c

8951384,0,t3_52sls7,I do conservation and antipoaching work but in Asia.Recently I attended the IPS conference and a number of the talks included discussions of drone use.  For the folks working in Africa the most important use often wound up being mapping.  In most areas people like me work the local maps are not very accurate and purchasing high resolution maps is prohibitively expensive and only captures a single moment in time.A drone is usually more expensive but allows you to track environmental changes over time at a small scale.  This is used to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration work changes in agricultural practices illegal logging spread of roads etc.A low cost mapping drone especially one that could capture fine scale DEM data not just orthophotography would be immensely useful for many people.,zoology,d7ntn2j,1,t5_2sn8c
9077861,0,t1_d82w7ms,Ideally something that can map at m or less and costs no more than  preferably less.  For the project I run we wouldt realistically be able to buy anything more than about  unless we managed to slip the expense into a grant submission. The majority of small projects which are the ones where this sort of device is most needed are in similar positions.Flight should be programmable because lineofsight is impossible in some types of terrain. ,zoology,d830fgs,1,t5_2sn8c
