1896945,0,t3_2gcgfr,Its because rebels are a SHITTY roleplay to engage in.Like what are the lords suppose to do? If there are people who blindly hate you on the street and want you dead what do we do? Put them in jail? Its not even like we DID ANYTHING to start the rebellion its been part of the server since day one and its boring. I told the rebels from the start that if you are screaming from the top of your lungs HEY WERE REBELS OUR MAIN BASE IS ON MAINSTREET AND WE ARE GOING TO OVERTHROW THE LORDS then its such a stupid and dull aspect that we cannot even engage with fans with.In this video because it was mailtime I decided to break through the wall and explain that. We dont want you rebelling for no reason because its not healthy for the server or roleplay. In the future will just jail this type of RP because it just doesnt fit in.We were just actively ignoring it but at this point it isnt going a way and I felt I needed to warn people before we put people in jail long periods of time and then have them complain. This honestly wasnt a problem until Pyro started egging the rebels on though. He gave them special items and stacks of TNT for heavens sake and suddenly everyone wanted to be a rebel. It was sorta just Pyro not really thinking through his plan because all it did is create this massive group of people we cannot play with. Like why would Lords of a city allow these people to even live? We wouldnt thats the problem. You dont have to love the lords and you can even roleplay to appose us but if your sitting on god damn mainstreet handing out rebel armor and weapons and claiming your going to overthrow the lords yeah that isnt healthy for the server.If you want to roleplay a rebellion understand that its something the Lords cant participate in because if we did it would only be us putting you in jail for the rest of your Lords of Minecraft career!,LordsOfMinecraft,ckhrt7z,36,t5_32pl4

Perhaps we were all physically dwarves but a curse was put on us that changed out outward shapes or we have the souls of dwarves in us which may result in them being liberated later perhaps? or something along those lines.We decided all three might simultaneously be true.,LordsOfMinecraft,cklnptp,3,t5_32pl4

Seriously stop complaining and be proactive rather than be just an ass.Build to Small Have you seen the plot size for the barrens Im sure they are so sorry for having smaller plots than the magic quarter. Big plots are still only tiny compared to the total size of a MQ big plot. They requested to the lords to be able to combine  plots to make it bigger Lords never dealt with it before the meeting. Perhaps go complain to the lords rather than those that tried to help it out.Seriously you claim to take the RP serious but just end up being a huge ass sure they made unneeded comments turns out pretty much every single person does.

Im not even sure if I can reschedule these but Id love you guys to join in if i can.

I understand that what we had in the past was a bit of a misunderstanding and in no way do I wish to dig a deeper hole for myself or anyone else for that matter.  I think that you guys trying to revitalize West Shire is great and so far it seems as if youre all doing a good job at it.  I never meant for this post to start any more disputes or arguments between  our group and yours as I only intended to spark up a bit of fun rp.  I see how the argument I had with Leonty on the WS subreddit may contradict this but please know that at the time I was already a bit worked up over other issues.  Im open to talk again about any more problems concerning all of this.  Thank you.,LordsOfMinecraft,cs29p6g,2,t5_32pl4

Honestly I would say that nearly all rp should have some ooc planning not writing a whole script and such but let everyone involved have a general idea of whats going on. As long as you manage to keep ooc and ic diffirent informing planning and spoiling should rarely be a problem.You could even tell the person when the kill is going to take place if they are good enough to let their character not act diffirently. Unless it is the kind of assasination where you just backstab someone and thats it but that would honestly not be much rp for the person getting killed but more for the surrounding people.,LordsOfMinecraft,csdqzgu,1,t5_32pl4
