So for Pink Cony I had been slowly farming for Lucifer Cony but after the last update Lucifer Cony was removed from special stages drop and when I saw the infuriating amount of materials I needed to evolve Witch Cony into Lucifer Cony and then into Pink Cony I decided to stop farming for cony and used two  SLs on her to master her.  I also used  SLs to master Scott since I dont have any other  rangers that are as useful to use on.

4603955,0,t1_ctan17b,yes iron moon skill did not reach baigo and susu iron moon skill is dedicated for rangers with long range not for frontline rangers. but sometimes baigo and susu can be affected by iron moon skill if they happened to pass by iron moon while hes activating his skill or iron moon stand too far in the front.honestly i hope you dont waste your SL on SABrown because even though his skill is great but it is not worth it to spend it on SABrown you better keep it and use it on future rangers because future ranger is always breaking current record and such. i myself almost spent my SL on SABrown but after thinking on its skillstatstype in the end i refuse to do so then Susu was released and a SMed Susu is better than SABrown plus i got a refund of SL.. splash type  seconds cooldown high stats cool skill.. so moral of the story is if you dont plan to waste your SL on Iron Moon better keep it for future  or  star rangers. but its your choice you can spend your SLs any way you want.. ,LineRangers,ctawyei,1,t5_32k8h

10078411,0,t3_5k2pd9,Just so you know you cannot get Riza from  rubies gacha. Her nonUE form is currently available from the friendship point gacha though. All of the FA ranger and gear is limited because they collaboration items. They will be gone at the end of the month. I dont suggest combining one more Edward Elric with the one you already have. The increase in stats would be minimal. Since you dont have a lot of rangers with high DPS on your team and you still have open spots itd be more beneficial to have two Edwards on your team than to combine them. The Christmas gacha also ends at the end of the month. The only limited ranger from the Christmas gacha is Jenny and the triple odds event for her ends very soon on the th at midnight Japan time. She attacks from a distance inbetween where frontline and midline rangers typically stand. She is quite a good support ranger since she can cast skill evade and skill use over allies and remove enemy invincibility.Gear is definitely important and one cannot have a good team without good gears! Although the odds are not great there are some good weapons and really OP armor this time around. If you need gear you can consider it. If your team is only those  rangers though I think ranger gacha may be more beneficial. Which ranger gacha to roll may depend on what youre looking for. Roy or Alphonse would benefit you for damage and tank but your team could also really use some more support rangers that give invincibility buff and skill useevade. Im not sure which gacha would end up being more beneficial given that youre only doing one spin and it depends on your luck haha. How I see it though  rubies gacha is not bad. Its cheaper and you still have a chance at many good rangers. Even though there are some rangers without skills mixed in if you get the nonUE version of a ranger you want you have the chance to eventually evolve them into their UE form. Of course this is the long route as youd need to get all the necessary resources but it gives you more options. On the other hand the  rubies gacha is only for rangers with skills but it still includes a lot of useless rangers. But as the FA rangers are only included in the  gacha I have a feel that many people would recommend it instead.,LineRangers,dbl8kjg,3,t5_32k8h
