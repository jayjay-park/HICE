After some quick googlefu I believe youre talking about a cognitive map As for traveling outside my city to another destination I have another cognitive map thats more zoomed out and I know where my city is in relation to other big cities if that makes sense and I just switch between them. Also I tend to form temporary cognitive maps of unfamiliar cities using landmarks instead of directions. You could try asking rpsychology and they might be able to direct you to a more helpful subreddit.

2468081,0,t1_cmgf7uz,I have scientific evidence that asthma is caused by a parasite or one or more of its developmental stages.First are eggs in the digestional tract. These hatch and go to the lungs where they grow and molt. They produce some very noxious chemicals. This is the stage during which they probably cause asthma. Some people develop asthma and some people dont.Then they travel up the trachea in sputum. Much of this sputum gets swallowed and this stage travels to the stomach. Then they travel to a certain spot in the digestive tract attach there and become adults. These adults then produce more eggs. Some developmental stages travel to other parts of the body. Psoriasis and eczema are caused because one of the functions of skin our largest organ is to neutralize or sequester toxic chemicals whenever they are encountered. And these stages produce some very toxic chemicals. So they show up in the skin.Epilepsy and seizures are caused when parasite stages colonize the brain.What else would you like to discover?,findareddit,cmgr67q,-6,t5_2sey6

You have to make a commitment like stop using social media for such and such time or get used to going outside for a while for walking in the park or street and turn off all social media. I have been easing through this for myself at least going outside and forgetting technology for a while is really nice. But for starters I think you should just go on regularly and as the weeks go on discipline yourself in not going on for an extending amount of time and as more weeks or days go by and you use less time on reddit you will get into the habit of just going on for one hour at least or just stopping completely and just enjoying what great things life has to offer other than in the digital world.

3671278,0,t1_cqaqlec,Exactly! When I say Sugar Free I use the term loosely. You still have fructose coupled with its natural fiber thus less damaging in fruit veg and in small doses elsewhere like whole wheats but are otherwise cutting out shitty fructose and HFCS if youre in the USA that does nothing for you  e.g. desserts white breads soda etc. Its very cool that youre doing a research paper on this. Im sure then youre familiar with Gillespie Dr Lustig and John Yudkin? I bought the Gillespie book on a whim and I cant believe how convinced I am  which led me to read the other two for more scientific evidence. Im a serious disciple now  Ive been low fructosing for  weeks now and the most shocking thing Ive noticed is the lack of hunger pangs. I mean I used to have to restrain myself to not go and eat what I thought was healthy cereal bars and sweet things constantly. I get very mild hunger pangs now Ive gone low sugar  around meal times. I get NO cravings whatsoever. This is absolutely incredible for me. Ive struggled with eating disorders and dangerous habits for many years and Im now absolutely sure it was because of how addictive sugar is.  weeks is early on so Im giving it a lot more time before I make official judgement but I already find myself lighter feeling so much BETTER about myself and not fighting the cravings any longer thus not giving in and then hating myself for being a failure. Its so much more than a bullshit diet. It just makes complete sense not to eat an addictive nonbeneficial substance. I will definitely look up that HBO documentary Im currently bingeing instead of on sugar? on anything books or otherwise  that back the fructose  bad argument up. Thanks!edit The amount of fructose recommended by Gillespie is about  grams per day which is about g sugar  it all fits with what youve said from the FDA.

7255264,0,t1_d22rak6,I am going to make a few assumptions then offer advice. Funny enough you mention that you were asked if your son has autism my son went to Beavers as part of his socialization with his behavioral worker to help his autism. If I didnt know any better it sounds like you live in my town. The closeness of the community circles can be uncomfortably tight. Especially if you are a transplant or dont have long bloodlines in the community. Here is an internet hug I can feel your desperate situation The first thing is to separate how unfair it feels to you and how fleeting this moment will be for your son. I know the mama bear feelings you are experiencing and it will drive you nuts. Let it go... find other things to enjoy with your son and put this behind you. I know... but but its just bullshit and unfair!!! and you would be right   Get your son in a good place and away from this drama that is the life blood of small town. I dont mean move away just get him into other activities and out of reach of the power trippers...because that is what they are. The most important thing is to show your son he is more important than making adults that should know better behave like adults seriously they will not change. I hope I dont come off as condesending but I have raised  kids one with autism. There are battles worth fighting but only pick the ones that are worth it. Take notes note names places and times then file it away if the patterns repeat otherwise grab some sand toys go to the park with your son and finish off with an icecream cone just talking about whats on his mind. I promise those moments will mean much more to you and him than wasting energy fighting something you cannot win. PM me if you need more support... been there done that and got the grubby  tshirt ,findareddit,d22ve71,2,t5_2sey6

7452742,0,t3_4heb64,This has been said more times than can be counted What other people think about you does not make you who you are. This remains true so please do NOT focus on others opinions. The only factor in making you what you are is what YOU believe.If you cannot accept the way you are you will perpetually be unhappy. Acceptance changes everything but it is not easy to achieve. On the other hand if you see the way your are and you believe you can change what you see you might find happiness.There is no guarantee but there always will be hope. Because you dont see hope does not mean it is not there. Hope is there. Always. In the meantime you may want to talk to a therapist or counselor who can point out your habitual negative thinking patterns. Apparently you have a few but that is not unusual nor or you alone in this regard. Negative thinking is very common. The good news with a little help and your own sincere wish you can transition into more positive and productive ways to approach your life. Seek help otherwise you are your own counsel. AFAIK negative thinking never creates positive results. Seek help from someone you can trust who is very positive or find someone who is professionally trained to deal with the issues youre having. Ultimately though you must make the changes yourself no one can talk or reason you into it. You must want and seek change for it to occur.On a lighter note you speak of being an empath someone who feels deeply. This is an extraordinary gift and not particularly common. I know this from experience and also know from experience that if you learn to work with your empathic skills there can be great reward. You have a lot going for you but just havent recognized it yet. ,findareddit,d2pbvpg,1,t5_2sey6

11544182,0,t1_dg4in2p,That is correct. Those jacks are probably wired to a PBX unit somewhere else in the building so you would have to have phones that are the same brand as the PBX or at least use the same protocol to plug into those jacks. As far as I know there isnt just one type of digital signal  I think each PBX uses a proprietary protocol on the wire.Cisco phones are good but unless you also have a CUCM server to manage them theyre rather tricky to set up. Not too long ago my gf bought a CP phone for her office hoping to use it directly with some OTC SIP VoIP service and WOW that thing was finicky. Took me forever to get it working but I finally did and even then only partially. Only the basic phone functions work.,findareddit,dg4j9fa,2,t5_2sey6
