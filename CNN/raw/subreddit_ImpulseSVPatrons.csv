7172873,0,t3_4dqw86,I completely agree with all of these and think that this is a great idea. I am not too sure what farms you are talking about when you ask for improvements but we do not want to have all farms in spawn be automated with redstone as those would then always be loaded putting an unnecessary strain on the server.This where the auto farms will go is something I will need to bring up with the other mods and also double check if what I said is correct.,ImpulseSVPatrons,d1thl30,2,t5_36zgt
