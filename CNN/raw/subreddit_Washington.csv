The county has  of all the Superfund sites in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska but less than th of  percent of the land mass. Kitsap Sun Toxic KitsapKitsaps toxicity is historically due to its roots in the timber trade and the wide use of creosote. A much greater contemporary impact was the Navy using the Peninsulas waterways as dump sites. At least one landbased Navy landfill has an elementary school built on top of it.Water monitoring conducted throughout Kitsap County has identified elevated levels of fecal coli from bacteria in some streams which make them unsuitable for basic recreational uses.Washington has one of the highest rates of Multiple Sclerosis in the world. The cause is unknown but the incidence of M.S. is many times higher than the rest of the world and three times higher than the rest of the U.S.Washington also has one of the highest rates of all types of cancer and specifically breast cancer in the U.S.This is anecdotal but of a really tight group of five girls that grew up here who are all now in their midthirties four already have breast cancer.,Washington,ceu1tk2,2,t5_2qjvz

I would not recommend commuting to Seattle.  Driving the I is absolutely miserableeven when there is no traffic. A small accident will likely shut down  lanes and easily multiply your commute time and driving through JBLM is always slow regardless of the time of day. Even commuting from Tacoma to Olympia is draining I have heard. I work with a few people who commute from Seattle to Oly and it is a very challenging way of life.  If youre set on living in the south sound I would recommend searching for work in the area.  I cannot offer any insight on the job market but I can say that living in Oly is great.   hour from Seattle  from Portland  the Columbia River Gorge  from Mt. Rainier  from Olympic National Park  from the Oceanif you are out doorsy you will love it here.We initially planned on living in downtown Olympia but couldnt find a reasonable rental. We also have  dogs and it is difficult to find a yard with a fenced in back.  We live in Lacey which is pretty strip mally but perfectly fine for now.

But even a tiny risk was too much given the heavy toll legal problems could have on a nonprofit with an annual budget of  he said. The fact is that there is significant risk and potential legal liability for everyone who has constructive possession of those firearms via having keys and proximal access to them. On top of that the museum has to pay to transfer the firearms back to their original owner and its not the  you claim but usually  per gun. For a museum operating on such a small budget thats a burdensome expense.,Washington,cm86wd3,2,t5_2qjvz

4286577,0,t3_3a2sip,Youre going to find gang activity in any small town with enough pissed off  somethings. They mostly fight amongst themselves though. Where on earth do you live currently that you arent concerned about the people around you? Id bet you theres gangs where you live now that youre just not aware of. If youre east of the mountains especially youre going to be seeing a lot of gang activity. The Seattle Times did an article on it. If youre concerned about gangs first consider that they dont JUST run around doing malevolent acts and being shitty. Many groups of thugs will collectively spend money at a local store so it doesnt go under saving the closest grocery store for a bunch of people or just hang around with one another and go fishing. Nobody talks about them just doing peaceful things together because its not flashy its not shocking and it doesnt bring in the readers. There are a lot of small town farmers whod be considered members of an active gang who just do their thing and host meetings once in a while where they all get together and relax or talk. Generally speaking youre never going to see these guys act like gang members unless you are buying drugs prostitutes or gambling on the street. I might also get a lot of shit for this but if youre moving to Washington you should also know there are several active white pride groups. If youre some nonwhite skinned color dont worry they wont hunt you down in your home or light burning crosses on your yard. They focus largely on improving their home communities and stopping their own from being bad examples. Ive heard plenty a bar story of them following a guy after he hit his girlfriend beating the hell out of him and telling him theyd be watching that he didnt do it again. HOWEVER theft is another issue altogether. Small town theft is rampant and usually motivated by drug addiction. If youre concerned about home theft use blinds in parts of your house that youre not in often back rooms bedroom windows and such. Open windows are like a buffet table for a drug addict with little foresight. Having a dog already is a wonderful thing hell alert you and scare off potential thieves. If you have a garage dont store things in it that you couldnt cope with losing. Put motion sensor lights over the doorways and your garage door if applicable they scare the piss out of someone trying to find their way in. Leave a TV running or music on a computer blaring if youll be out for a while it makes it hard to gauge for a thief whether or not someone is there so they often wont test it. If youre not a dick to your neighbors theyd chase people off for you provided it was a neighborhood and not a little house in the middle of nowhere. If youre REALLY paranoid you can make sure your doors are solid hardwood with deadbolts but most thieves whod try to break the door would just break a window at that point. If youre concerned dont look for no gang areas look for areas that are not filled with lowincome homes. Below a certain level of poverty most people receive poor educations. Without education all racial stereotypes are true everyone is a piece of shit and everyone is addicted to drugs. A highincome neighborhood would be safer if youre planning on building a family with your wife. ,Washington,cs8tgpr,6,t5_2qjvz

Im a Democrat too but that doesnt mean we can ignore biases just because the are in our favor.reddit in general is ridiculously left wing and there is basically nothing to praise trump over unless youre a fascist.  look at the growth of latestagecapitalism if you want an example.the younger generations are recognizing that right wing really means i should be allowed to spew hate and discriminate against the other.  empathic people dont buy into that garbage and as such anything that isnt a right wing safe space will veer left.maybe instead of calling for the censorship of subreddits you dont like you can instead understand why many people think right wing philosophy is garbage and stop calling for them to be excluded.,Washington,d8gbr4e,-1,t5_2qjvz

10323377,0,t1_dcdiktb,...except it hurts those who are above the old minimum wage.Prices will find an equilibrium that is a function of minimum wage.  If youre working full time making  more than the minimum wage MW then your annual income will be about around MW and your expenses will be somewhere on the order of MW leaving you with MW.After the wage hike your wages are MW when we reach the new equilibrium however your expenses will still be MW leaving you with  less.And what of the people whose work isnt worth the new minimum wage?  Do they have to get unpaid internships until their work is valuable enough?No Im afraid that the only group that benefits from a minimum wage hike are the people who are making less than the new minimum wage whose work is already worth more than the new minimum wage and it only helps them until prices adjust to the new equilibrium. ,Washington,dce7mo6,2,t5_2qjvz

10572269,0,t1_dd6frhj,gt The government also argued that Congress had plenary power to enact such a law under its authority to control immigration and that both the executive and judicial branches must defer to that decisionmaking. Breyer noted that while Congress may use that power they must choose a constitutionally permissive means of implementing that power and the interpretation that the government advocates is not such a permissive means. The court ruled that a hearing must be held after a sixmonth detention. Substantive due process applied to aliens that resided within the United States and absent a showing that they were a danger to society or a flight risk they could not be detained.gt Texas officials had argued that unauthorized immigrants were not within the jurisdiction of the state and could thus not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim finding instead that no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction can be drawn between resident aliens whose entry into the United States was lawful and resident aliens whose entry was unlawful. The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim agreeing with the Court that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to aliens who after their illegal entry into this country are indeed physically within the jurisdiction of a state. The dissent simply concluded that the distinction the statute drew should survive an equal protection attack.Are you going to continue to be snarky or are you going to admit that the th applies to aliens illegal or otherwise?,Washington,dd6g3ez,3,t5_2qjvz
