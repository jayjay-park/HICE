7242205,0,t3_4emhkw,Yah know I have been wondering this about Kolsch and some other German lagers. They are conditioned in a pitch lined oak barrel and then served fresh from the barrel no co pushing them. I would think that would have some affect on flavor if not the actual flavor of the beer but even the carbonationpour.You could always try and find an old oak barrel that someone wants to get rid of and do a miniature open ferment. Line it with some paraffin. Use a little wooden spoon to stir it. ,lagerbrewing,d21dwsr,1,t5_3dnzl

7245295,0,t1_d21oe9x,Yeah thats actually what got uunsungsavior and I talking about it.Im pretty antidecoction because I dont think it does anything noticeable when done correctly but when I discovered that most of the literature says to only use decoction on undermodified malt it got Matt and I running down that trail and Im curious if maybe decoction does make a noticeable difference when using undermodified malt.,lagerbrewing,d21qky2,2,t5_3dnzl
7301139,0,t1_d27yrkq,I copypaste the report section from BWS into notes on BeerSmith. And note if I am using a standard water profile...I wish it was integrated into BeerSmith or some other recipe tool.,lagerbrewing,d2838wt,1,t5_3dnzl
7307390,0,t1_d28fdj9,I tried adding another sachet to one keg with some priming sugar. Its been in there a week and Im going to taste it today and see how it compares to the other keg. I will post a follow up!,lagerbrewing,d28stu4,1,t5_3dnzl

7391763,0,t1_d2i2vvd,Im obviously not Annie but figured Id shoot you a response since you referenced the method I wrote about. Ive considered updating it since I dont really abide by it much these days but Im hesitant out of fear others experience might be similar to mine. What I do these is pitch at my target ferm temp which is usually F then let the beer actively ferment at that temp for  days. Its usually about the th day after brewing that I simply bump the regulator up to my target drest temp of F and let the beer free rise I unplug my heater to that this takes anywhere between  days depending on outside temps. From there I let it finish fermenting and cleaning up takes about  days depending on OG then I cold crash without stepping it down and allow the probe to read ambient chamber temp so I remove it from the side of the carboy fine with gelatin  hours later let it sit for another  or so hours then keg it carb it and drink it so long as it is crystal clear.,lagerbrewing,d2ie6dt,3,t5_3dnzl
7412858,0,t1_d2kry6r,So a is American Light Lager and b is American Lager. The only difference I see is ABV and there is overlap in that. and they share the same commercial examples... Maybe weBJCP need a bit more versatility in these. ,lagerbrewing,d2kskcw,1,t5_3dnzl
