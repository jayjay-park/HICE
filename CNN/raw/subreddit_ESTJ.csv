10872296,0,t3_5v8mfh,I am also an ESTJ female and I know our personalities can sometimes intimidate others too. But dont lose hope definitely keep your standards youll be unhappy in a relationship if you lower them! There is nothing wrong with you. Sounds like youre looking for quality over quantity and thats what matters. But also remember to be openminded. We are very mind driven rather than heart driven so dont get frustrated if at first youre not totally feeling it...that can definitely develop with time. The guy I am dating right now is very smart and ambitious which is something I really value as well. And he knows that I dont put up with his bullshit which is something he values about me. Our personalities mesh and balance each other out well..,ESTJ,de1eend,1,t5_2tk2p
