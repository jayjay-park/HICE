290188,0,t3_1xfbwj,gt The Bible is the word of God though.  Therefore whenever it touches on areas that affect biology or geology or astronomy it would be the authority.  That would then make it the authority by which we should then judge our own opinions about these matters. This is the issue and I doubt OP is the author but this needs to be said you can not use the Bible as proof of your viewpoint. As soon as someone says the Bible is the word of god and that proves their point I stop listening its like saying    is  because I say so. Youre right because we understand math but youre wrong because that isnt how you prove something. When I learn physics Im not told its correct Im instructed in its theory and conception. What this quote is is a cop out. It is a way for someone who doesnt understand the world to say god did it because god says he did. Another thing we dont teach creationism in a science classroom because it isnt science. We teach evolution because it is a scientific theory on biological organisms and how we got from point a to point human version . It is not a belief system you can not compare creationism and evolution by calling them both based on faith because your proof is a religious text and ignorance whether by fault or not and evolution is a continued quest to doubt what we know because we know one day we might find something new about the world. People who understand science dont think about a problem with an answer in mind they see a problem or question and they look for an answer which could very likely prove an hypothesis wrong.

471880,0,t1_cftkczm,I think youre a bit confused. Mutation is not a force in shaping gene pools that is distinct from drift or selection. Mutations arise and can increase or decrease in frequency but they do so either due to selection or drift. Migration is of gene flow not a mechanism of evolution which can keep otherwise separate populations from becoming too distinct but distinct here can mean a lot of different things depending on how small of a difference you focus on.Drift tends to be a slow process but generalizations are just that generalizations. There are often exceptions.Are you asking about speciation or smaller scale evolution? In terms of speciation it has been shown that speciation by genetic drift is possible basically only in theory I can elaborate on why if you want. Speciation basically always involves selection the prominent exception and off the top of my head the only one shown to have happened is genome duplication.,evolution,cftwlfd,2,t5_2qhs7

646948,0,t1_cgdrypn,gt will the apes that we see todays ancestors evolve into a different or similar species of humans?? The only way to answer this honestly would be to have a time machine and actually go forward in time. What happens to species in the future depends on all sorts of things like changes in climate grasslands can become deserts or jungles can become grasslands etc the appearance or disappearance of predators or competitors currently other apes would be competing with us for living space changes in geography think species on a peninsula that suddenly becomes an island after a big earthquake catastrophes like asteroid impacts if it wasnt for that asteroid  million years ago we might still be small shrewlike rodents random genetic drift sometimes species get lucky if a mutation appears that gives them a strong advantageOver millions of years thats a lot of variables. Youd have more luck guessing lottery numbers.We can speculate though. If humans suddenly disappeared and our nuclear reactors shut down automatically and our sudden death didnt trigger an environmental disaster its entirely possible that the apes of today might continue to evolve in such a way that mirrors our own evolution. gt why arent there any of the species that were in between us such as homo erectus anymore?They didnt make it. Neanderthals died out really recently only about  years ago. While theres genetic evidence that indicates we were genetically similar enough to mate with them and produce offspring they were different enough that various challenges were impossible to overcome. Theres evidence that they werent unable to cope with changes in climate while humans were able to cope. Theres also the hypothesis that humans were slightly better at hunting than they were and it was just a matter of time before their numbers dwindled. For what its worth there was a time when humans were almost extinct. Our numbers dropped to something like  individuals the population of my home town which is dangerously low. It wasnt until we made it out of Africa and started populating the rest of the globe that our numbers grew but even then it wasnt until the agricultural revolution as well as the industrial revolution that our numbers really took off. I think its fair to say that had things been even just a little different we could have ended up like the Neanderthals and some other species could have appeared instead.,evolution,cgdt3ud,3,t5_2qhs7
656017,0,t1_cgeu3it,Glad I could help With Lamarck its important to remember that he felt that the body responded to needs which could arise through strenuous activity or stress by actively building up parts of the body designed to meet these needs or by creating a part of the body to do so. Much in the same way that a person lifting heavy objects would develop muscle mass in order to lift even heavier objects. Lamarck then imagined that these fulfilled needs could then be passed down to offspring.To Lamarck the creation of a new organ would work something like this A creature gets infected by a microorganism so it sends its need signals but there is no specific part of the body responsible for meeting this need there might be increased activity in whatever primitive immune system exists but little else. If the need is strong enough or is triggered often enough and the creature survives long enough the body would create something to help deal with the need not a whole organ or anything something more like a lymph node. The next generation would also receive lymph nodes and if they were exercised enough by the body sending need signals they might eventually evolve into a specialized organ.So while the classic example of a giraffe stretching its neck out until it stays that way might be a good starting point the rule would also apply to every body system. Though it does become more difficult to picture for some systems. My best advice is to imagine what need any part of the marine iguana might be fulfilling and how the body might try to meet that need in Lamarcks theory.,evolution,cgeu7p0,2,t5_2qhs7

How could such a species then survive without an ecosystem food web resources etc to support it? When he asks Why would such a species evolve? hes not implying there is a guiding hand other than the natural principles of evolution. Youre asking why has something not yet evolved to wipe everything out? A chance mutation mostly requires that it is somehow beneficial to the survival of the organism to be passed on to offspring. An overwhelming advantage against all other species would be selfregulating as other species evolve to survive and whatever supports the overwhelming species is consequently thrown out of equilibrium. Take for instance The Great Oxygenation Event. The success of one species wiped out a lot of other species but in doing so changed the conditions favorable to its own survival. Other species were able to cope with these changes through evolution and in doing so brought the environment back to homeostasis.,evolution,cld8nr7,2,t5_2qhs7

Answers In Genesis at the very bottom of their Statement of Faith page saysgt By definition no apparent perceived or claimed evidence in any field including history and chronology can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record.In other words no evidence no matter how credible or compelling it might be is wrong if it disagrees with the bible. Now I dont expect this pastor to have exactly the same views as Ken Ham but it would be very worth your while to ask at the very beginning of this debatediscussion to ask what evidence if it existed would cause you to rethink your position? Get them to be as specific as possible.If they admit that no evidence would change their mind then in my mind the discussion is over. Its thats simple. They have admitted that theyve made up their mind and even if Jesus himself came to Earth and showed them a biology powerpoint presentation they would still not accept it.A second thing I would recommend assuming the pastor says that he could be persuaded to reconsider his position if credible evidence existed is to ask him to explain in a few sentences his understanding of evolution as described by scientists. I would bet money that the definition or description he gives contains misconceptions of some kind. In my experience it is extremely uncommon for creationists to actually describe what scientists actually claim about evolution and instead claim something else and their misconceptions continue on from there.

This is simply not possible without a significant reproductive preference. If youre arguing that it is NOT sexually selected for then youre arguing that light skinned people are significantly healthier than dark skinned people. Otherwise there is simply no other explanation as to how light skin could evolve with this type of handicap.

It is poorly defined because they dont say anything about this designer other than it did something at some time for some reason. The reason for that of course is that they mean God and by God they mean the god as described in a literal interpretation of the Bible. But it is worse than that. God is not a designer God as described is a creator. God said let their be life and there was life. Their intelligent designer rather designs and design is an evolutionary process. Forget these unknown intelligent designers and look at the example we have of known possibly intelligent designers humans. We do not create in the Biblical sense we design. Design consists of modifying things that exist and then seeing if it works. Can I make this thinner? If I make it in blue will people buy it? If there is an intelligent designer then there is evolution. ,evolution,crtcf5r,7,t5_2qhs7

6953894,0,t3_4ayh85,Well there has been a trend towards greater complexity in some lineages. I mean our ancestors  billion years ago were certainly not as complex as we are now. That said our ancestors a billion years ago probably werent all that more or less complex than modern bacteria. The thing is evolution will only trend towards complexity when complexity is beneficial. Viruses have pretty much nothing in the way of complexity but they have been evolving for millions if not billions of years.In many cases complexity is actually harmful. Let me just draw an analogy to something else to help explain this. A engine with  parts has more potential points of failure than an engine with . So why on earth would you use and engine with  parts when you could have an engine with only ? In the same way more complex organisms are typically less flexible. Take a sponge put it into the best blender on the world run some individuals cells through a filter leave them alone and  weeks later the sponges individual cells will have reformed into a new sponge. Try that with a human and you wont have a newly formed baby human youll have a newly formed life sentence without parole for murder.Because sponges are very simple they can do things like completely reform themselves humans are way to complicated to do that. With complexity comes the cost of adaptability. It doesnt just come down to being able to heal complexity comes with other costs. For instance very complicated body plans take lots of genetic code to build and lots of time. Very complicated things often are more vulnerable to extinction bacteria are a lot simpler than dinosaurs and were able to survive things dinosaurs couldnt. I mentioned earlier that more parts come with more points of failure and this is true with organisms as well. If you want to kill a bacteria you only have a few ways to do it you could go after the cell membrane the DNA or a handful of other things. If you want to kill a human you could go for the heart the lungs any of several major blood vessels the throat the brain the spinal cord the liver you could use poisons to attack the individual cells you could drown them you could starve them so on and so forth. Pretty much any internal organ is a point of failure. Organisms with more internal organs will face a larger variety of diseases. Which do not have hearts will not have to deal with heart disease.More complicated animals also have higher requirements as far as nutrition is concerned. Humans spend  of our energy on our brains which is tremendous considering how small our brains are compared to the rest of our body. Animals without brains will not have to deal with those costs we do. Warm blooded mammals need to expend energy to maintain their temperature. Our bodies are tasked with keeping our internal temperature at . degrees Fahrenheit   organisms that are cold blooded do not have to deal with those costs. Crocodiles can go more than a year without eating largely because they dont have to spend so much energy on their temperature. My point is basically that evolution will only trend towards complexity when complexity is advantageous. Any other time more organisms should typically err on the side of simplexity if its a choice between an engine with  parts and an equally good engine with  parts then the engine with  parts is obviously the better choice.Edit I also want to point out that we havent defined complexity yet. I dont think we can define complexity but we all know it when we see it. That said I want to point out the fact that we cant fall into the trap of thinking that intelligence  complexity. Humans are no more complicated then mice are. Humans and mice both have the same organs the same types of tissues the same types of cells the mice just arrange them differently. However both mice and humans are more complex than say crocodiles are. Crocodiles lack a neocortex I think. Im certain they dont have a prefrontal cortex but Im not  certain about the neocortex in general humans and mice dont. I keep catching myself mistaking intelligence with complexity and I think it is necessary to point out that they are not the same.,evolution,d14k1g2,3,t5_2qhs7

Some fish can see ultraviolet and some are sensitive to polarized light. Amongst jawless fish the lamprey has welldeveloped eyes while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. The ancestors of modern hagfish thought to be the protovertebrate were evidently pushed to very deep dark waters where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators and where it is advantageous to have a convex eyespot which gathers more light than a flat or concave one. Unlike humans fish normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer to or further from the retina. gtFish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment for example deep sea fish have eyes suited to the dark environment.

8687603,0,t1_d6rj177,You are right specialization does limit the types of resources you can use  but remember specialization is driven by selection. The reason species specialize is because those few resources the specialized species can use are are less accessible to nonspecialists and so they face less pressure from competition. It extends the overall access to resources even though the number of kind is reduced. The threat of extinction from competition is replaced by the possibility that they might loss that resource and thus go extinct because they are unable to use other resources. Now before the species specializes it is a generalist species. The reason it specializes is because the individuals of the species that remain generalists are outcompeted by other generalist species or by collectives of specialists. So if the generalist species did not specialize it would go extinct. Specializing while not a long term solution to eliminating the threat the extinction delays it somewhat and offers those species capable of specializing a second chance of escaping extinction. ,evolution,d6rkt2o,0,t5_2qhs7

9300590,0,t1_d8uv1vk,gt The article just stated that because the flagellum is built using a few of the same proteins as other parts of the cell that its not irreducibly complex. Did you read the article? It states that of the  kinds of proteins found in the flagellum of E.coli  are present in all flagellum and of those  all but two have other uses in the cell. Thats more than a few.Most of the other  are likely used in other locations as well. Im not well versed enough in the particulars of the E.coli flagellum to know exactly how many.gt The likelihood of such a thing occurring is astronomically unlikely that you need to have faith in luck to believe the flagellum was built that way.The likelihood of all  kinds of proteins coming together all at once is astronomical agreed. But no one is arguing that thats what happened. Evolution builds on top of previously existing structures and that older structure doesnt need to provide the same function.Heres a video discussing the evolution of the flagella.It shows how a cell can start with a simple passive pore in the membrane and with the addition or modification of just one protein at a time that structure takes on a new role.It goes from a passive pore to an active one then to a pilus which is a structure that bacteria use to attach themselves to objects and then a wiggling pilus which functions as a flagella but poorly. Further refinements allowed it to become a fully functioning one.The point though is that each step is only one small change and still imparts an advantage to the bacteria that can be selected for. Theres no need for a designer to make everything magically come together at once. Evolution can work on and refine each step of the process making simple changes that over time add up to an incredibly complex structure.And the really interesting thing is that nearly every step in the process still exists in bacteria today. Not every species of bacteria has evolved the same flagellum. Some are more complex than others and we can see how some are modifications of earlier simpler designs.Edit Heres another video talking about the bacterial flagellum with more examples of incomplete flagella functioning perfectly well as other types of structures.,evolution,d8ux0m9,2,t5_2qhs7
9317374,0,t1_d8x1dao,So is this considered the concept of micro evolution? To my understanding micro evolution is the necessary evolution required by a species in a particular environment i.e. Darwins finches. Would macro evo then be what I was contemplating in my original post where one species dominates another by a particular bias? Or am I way off base? My juxtaposition of chance vs. evolution was definitely a poor correlation. But Im curious about your reference to alleles. Seriously forgive me for needing a science lesson... Im a liberal arts major.But my understanding of alleles are simply as a mutation not necessarily a beneficial mutation. Is that wrong? In your cited study what does black or white mice have to do with benefitting overall as a species? Sorry if this is turning into more of an ELI. My questioned seemed specific to this sub so I thought Id post it directlyEdit and to answer your question about my idiotic correlation... I was playing with my new kitten and it made me think of how at some point cats werent domesticated. I recently read something couldnt cite if I tried... about how cats mostly meow to communicate with people. They rarely meow to communicate to each other. It made me wonder if the difference between an early world with no domesticated cats to our present with tame kittens that seem to have intelligent inflection alerting me when theyre hungry upset tired etc. was an evolutionary advancement that will at some point in the very VERY distant future become a genuine concrete understanding between kitty language and people language or if Im just balling way too much into a too simplistic thought.,evolution,d8x1n6o,1,t5_2qhs7

10196422,0,t1_dbzs0c6,gt ad hominem is when u say anything bout the presenter instead of the argument presentedPeople do have a right to know that their time may be wasted when they spend  minutes typing out a response to a person who may not be receptive to scientific information. You can call it whatever you want but people have this right.gt Please tell me the credible scientific information presented that debunks my argument. Youve been told numerous times here that your ideas are overly simplistic or too general or are inaccurate extrapolations with examples or explanations for why this is.gt do men not love women primarily for physical beauty and youth and do women not primarily love men for their social status since these are the traits that are most advantageous in mate selection?Youre failing to make the distinction between love and sexual attraction. I agree that sexual attraction is at its core based on primal instincts involving selecting suitable mates. Its no surprise that weve evolved to find symmetrical faces and smooth clear skin to be attractive because people with these traits are more likely to be healthy. The problem is that there are cultural influences that muddy things considerably some men find women with small breasts attractive while others prefer larger breasts and there are cultures where breasts are not sexualised the way they are in the United States for example. Separating cultural influences from purely biological instinctual ones is difficult especially when those cultural norms are themselves the result of biology.Longterm commitment is something that evolves in social animals where its beneficial. Two parents who love each other are going to stay together and hopefully be monogamous are probably going to provide a better environment for rearing offspring than those parents who mate and then never see each other again. So while that trait monogamy longterm commitment is good for providing a stable environment for offspring its not good when it comes to maximising the number of mates a male can have. So like many things in nature theres are several competing things that typically reach equilibrium. Again on top of this there are cultural norms that work against some instincts if it were not for religious cultural influences trying to use reproduction as a means of control we might have more societies where divorce is more common and culturally acceptable.So to reiterate what others here have said its more complicated than you are making it out to be. There are a lot of factors and conflating sexual attraction with monogamylongterm commitment what you term romantic love doesnt help.,evolution,dbztk12,2,t5_2qhs7

Also there was a recent report no I dont have the source but you could google it is that Inuit populations and other populations living in that climate have adapted to eating foods higher in protein and fat and have lower incidences of ill effects of eating such a diet. As for this time period when our ancestors evolved they didnt have supermarkets and global trade. So getting all the necessary nutrients especially protein from plants and grains was tough. Times were tough and if you couldnt hack it you died and didnt reproduce. Meat is jam packed with protein and fat allowing for fast growth and nutrients year around when plants may be scarce.
