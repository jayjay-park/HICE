10028249,0,t3_5j8w0e,I actually had an argument with a Wendys employee the other day about the spelling of our glorious name. You know how the ask for your name and enter it on their terminal to call you when your order is ready? She spelled it Miceal. A coworker asked her if she was aware that it had an H in it. She said yes thats my brothers name. I said well its also supposed to be ael too. She said No thats not right its pronounced Mishell Micheal is correct.,Michael,dbepine,3,t5_2qif7
