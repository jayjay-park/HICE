4145431,0,t1_crs9wcw,Heres a quick map Ive just knocked up in Paint. The yellow highlighted lines are where the Class s are currently in service. The line from Earlestown to Warrington Bank Quay is also now electrified and services should begin by the end of the year as Northern acquire more units.,uktrains,crssnkg,3,t5_2z9xu

7183086,0,t1_d103266,I think the evidence is very weak especially with brighter headlights and stricter rules about track access and safety. However for a while the position has been that the cost is virtually zero so unless it actually did some harm it should be kept. ,uktrains,d1unk2b,1,t5_2z9xu
7663905,0,t1_d3d5ovc,Glad you are pleased with the post and well done for being a GWSR volunteer.  I probably spotted the locomotive back in the early s while on Basingstoke station with my Ian Allen ABC book.,uktrains,d3dcc4d,2,t5_2z9xu
8903167,0,t3_527ksf,Wikipedia says s use English Electric J traction motors some of which were recovered from earlier Class s Cant find any more information than that sorry I know wiki seems like the obvious answer sometimes! PSome of SWTs s also reuse spare trailer cars from Class  and  units which were shortened to car formations when they were sent to Liverpool. Its easily spotted because the body profile and roofline are different to the  carriages,uktrains,d7i168d,1,t5_2z9xu
