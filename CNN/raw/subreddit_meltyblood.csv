7316517,0,t1_d29tztq,I know people play on keyboard and get good. However if you ever want to play with other people in person at a tournament or otherwise you will probably want to invest in a controller. Having a player on keyboard usually doesnt work out too well with laptop setups at events.,meltyblood,d29u724,4,t5_2t2ie
