I was under the impression that he had more midair jumps but after looking more closely he jumps into the dair and looking it up he only has  midair jumps I thought he had  or  it would seem he was out of jumps. As such he wouldnt make it back to the ledge unless he could upB back to the stage from the height at which he is grabbed which Im pretty sure he cant.So sorry.Edit Actually I think Ganon might have been dead too anyway since he burns his double jump before the stomp.,smashgifs,cj41szw,5,t5_30koz

4826914,0,t3_3gy0bo,To be honest I dont think YS is actually that good for marth against fox anymore. Marth requires room to move more than fox and dies super early on this stage. He can get tippers on the side plats easy but shielddropping has made this a lot more ineffective and often foxes can bait it for a free punish now. Furthermore fox can ride the walls to recover and the slant makes it where tipper dtilt and tipper fsmash edge guards dont work. Also randall can save ken combos.Its probably still like  because marth still kills early off of fsmash since side blast zones are small and marths sword covers so much of the stage along with uptilt covering more of the platform but it isnt as good as a lot of people seem to think. TBH I put it lower than battlefield because BF ledges are easy to edgeguard you have plenty of room to dashdancegtwavedash effectively fox has no wall to ride for sweetspots and you live longer. Only issue with BF is that they can camp you better.,smashgifs,cu2z0gs,8,t5_30koz
