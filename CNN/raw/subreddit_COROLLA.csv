9665023,0,t3_504zq8,Now a fuckin question I can answer. I use to have a small  leak in one of my front tires. Id stop at a service station every  weeks to put  lbs of air in. My car began to vibrate at highway speed. Finally got the tire into the shop to have it patched. It had about a pint of water in it. Seems the compressor also compresses the humidity in the air. Got my own compressor now with a thing to dehumidify the air.,COROLLA,da4f05s,1,t5_2t9rg

I get occasional single frame drop out on my pioneer BT deck in another car but thats just cause the deck has shitty Bluetooth firmware.Actually upon a quick google i see a LOT of ios users with this problem.

10394920,0,t3_5o3rmk,Still gonna stick with that engine Toyota? Wheres the TRD spirit? I love my XRS Ive been a TRD fan since my grandfather drove me around in his  Celica GT and it disappoints me that Toyota stopped developing TRD versions of any of their cars. Why is it that my  XRS can beat a st gen FRSBRZ in a drag race and in the corners? tldr BOOOOOOOORING,COROLLA,dcmbwxh,1,t5_2t9rg
