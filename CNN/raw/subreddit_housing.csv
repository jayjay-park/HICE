If the repairs are not made within the time outlined in the request then you can legally withhold rent or make the repairs yourself and deduct the amount you spent in repairs from the rent.  ,housing,d5rtkjx,1,t5_2qh7e

Your job offer will help and the employer may have some resources via the Human Resources department to assist with relocation  including helping you find a place to live.  Finding a longterm rental in one day will be hard  it would be better to plan ahead. Do research via the internet and see if you can find a monthtomonth rental near your new job with the plan to look for a new place once you have been in your job for a few months.I have been a landlord in the US to one degree or another for  years.  When someone applies to rent my house or apartment I give them back a basic rental application which includes some basic questions such asPrior living location with contact information for a referenceCurrent Employment info with contact info rough salary amountAnything I should know about credit problems or criminal historyPermission to run a background and credit checkSo long as they can afford the rent with their current job and dont have criminal history which they didnt disclose in the application Im pretty easy to work with.  If an applicant came to me with no credit history as a landlord it would be very risky for me to accept them and let them rent a property.  That wont mean that you will get a no answer but it does mean your monthly rent may be higher to cover the extra risk.That said many landlords work with people who dont have a credit history or have a poor credit history.  Especially if you are moving to an area with many immigrants this will be a common issue and more people will be familiar with how to handle it.  Talk to locals who have been through it to learn how to not be taken advantage of!  Learn the TenantLandlord laws for the state you are moving to and know both your rights as a renter and your legal responsibilities.If you are approved read your lease agreement and if you know a lawyer have them read it too.  Just because something is written down doesnt mean it is legal.  Make sure you and the landlord both understand what each is responsible for per the laws of the state you will be living in.  Be nice be polite but make sure they know you understand the process and you will be less likely to be taken advantage of.  Understand what a security deposit is how it works and what you need to do to get the money back when you move out.  Make sure the landlord is putting that money into an escrow account with both their name and your name attached to it.  Dont let them steal your security deposit if you dont break anything while living in the home  normal expected wearandtear almost never comes out of the security deposit.Get renters insurance.  Its not too expensive but will cover any lost items in case the apartment burns down and can potentially save you from a lot of difficulty should that occur.In the US a good credit history is very important to have  a good credit score can save you significant money.  Given your time frame find a place to live by trying lots of places be honest and up front and expect that some landlords wont talk to you without a credit history.Then build a credit score so you can find a new better and hopefully cheaper place the next year!A method Ive used to help some tenants improve their credit scores Save    Go to a bank and deposit that  into a savings account. Get a secured loan from the same bank in the amount of  the loan officer may be confused.  The key is that this will be a secured loan against the deposited money as collateral so no credit check needed.   Do not spend the loan money on anything else!   Pay the monthly payments on the loan using the loan money.  Do not pay ahead. In  months the loan is paid off plus a bit of interest and you get your original  deposit back.If you complete that you will have a much improved credit score due to paying off revolving credit on time.  Add to that having open credit cards which you use for some purchases during a month but are never late on paying back you will be able to apply for a new apartment from a much better position than you are in when you start out.  Keep in mind that a good credit score reflects your potential as a lowrisk moneymaking target for companies.  So being completely frugal and responsible no loans no credit cards no rent or mortgage can actually hurt your credit score.  The best score comes from lots of approved but unused credit aka available credit and a perfect history of paying borrowed money and rent ontime.,housing,dfm6dz6,1,t5_2qh7e

If so then I agree waiting might be better.One consideration  does your immigration paperwork require any sort of permanent address as part of your arrival?  Or are you allowed to put a temporary address down?,housing,dfyh5vj,1,t5_2qh7e
