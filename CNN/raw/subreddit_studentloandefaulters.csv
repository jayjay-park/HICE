But only recently in American economic thinking the myth of maximize shareholder value! as the only value was injected into their thinking and look where we are today. ,studentloandefaulters,cmztjzw,8,t5_33jzs
2661533,0,t1_cn5zfcf,Most people on twitter use accounts under their real name. Nobody wants to admit publicly that they are suffering from debt because they are afraid of being shamed for it. Shame is one of the most powerful mechanisms by which debtors are kept under heel.A better way to promote this group would be through the comments sections of articles about student debt on major blogs and news outlets.That being said it would still be wise to promote this group using existing hashtags related to the topic.,studentloandefaulters,cn5zn7c,1,t5_33jzs

Im sure theres no exact figures on such a general statement I was just thinking about people I know and I cant think of a single one who never missed or was late on a payment never took a deferment or forbearance never had to put off paying a different bill in order to make the loan payment and so on and so forth. ,studentloandefaulters,cnc12cw,1,t5_33jzs

3070499,0,t1_cog8yzc,Thanks for posting this. Ive managed to gather that the Feds are more limited in what they can garnish  of disposable than private companies and states. Ive been garnished by the state. It didnt take long. Private companies and states are able to garnish wages faster and able to take more.

3409433,0,t3_2z8dfl,I have this feeling that because so many of us are in the same boat with massive nondischargeable debt that as it becomes the new norm there will be changes made in the market to compensate. There is an equilibrium to life and economics to an extent so there will hopefully be a selfcorrection and having bad credit wont mean much in the future. ,studentloandefaulters,cpgwfls,2,t5_33jzs
3683227,0,t1_cq7zy2u,I think you greatly overstate your doomsday scenario.  You forgot to take into account that  in  are currently not making payments on their student loans whether they are in default late or in defermentforbearance without there being any coordinated default effort.  The  in  arent paying because they cant afford to pay.  Furthermore federal student loans are pretty much one of the only things that the government spends money on that makes a profit.  They actually end up making more off of defaulted students than the ones that are on time.   Also if all student loans including private and federal were for arguments sake part of the national debt . out of  Trillion is like .  Your argument basically says that even though  of what the government spends money on is just gone without any repayment requested that the whole economy would fail because of that ?I cant believe that you are seriously saying that it is the job of broke students coming out of college to support the ENTIRE economy make sure the people get their social security checks.  And also pay enough into health care without hardly using anything so that the older generation can have health care?  With your arguments you are basically saying that the rest of the population segments and all taxes on corporate profit are essentially irrelevant.,studentloandefaulters,cqc41yh,1,t5_33jzs

4919324,0,t3_3i7jui,Its actually far far more than  million.A  study by the Institute for Higher Education Policy found that of . million people leaving undergraduate schools in  a WHOPPING  were either in default forbearance deferment or otherwise delinquent on their loans.If these numbers hold broadly and I suspect that they do given that the economy was in fine shape in  and that delinquency rates and default rates have soared since then I estimate that something like  million currently arent paying on their loans. This is a HUGE number FAR more than the  million you cite.Also the threeyear default rate is probably around  as we speak.  This alone points to  million defaulters.  But remember the three year rate represents only a small fraction of all defaults many occur outside the roughly year window.  The TRUE LIFETIME default rate has got to be double that if not triple.  Mitch Weiss at Credit.com estimates the lifetime default rate to be about .  That may be a bit high but it may not be.  We simply dont know.  What we do know is that the problem is far far far worse than the Department of Education is letting on.  ,studentloandefaulters,cuemavh,3,t5_33jzs

6612422,0,t1_d033mhy,If youre in NV you need to talk to a lawyer. It sounds like your creditors were able to get a judgement against you wage garnishment so  basically a court order had been made and Im not sure if theres an SOL on court orders in NV. My guess would be no and I might start thinking about biting the bullet aka dealing with getting your wages garnished.All of my above advice was speaking to those who havent yet had a judgment against them. For you the fastest way out now is probably repayment. This debt now backed by court order is going to be sticking around most likely.You dont want to be dealing with this thing in  but youre on pace to now. With wage garnishments and extra jobs and extra payments you should be able to knock it out of your life a lot sooner than that.I know thats an extremely unpopular opinion here on this sub but youre at the stage of default where youre fighting the law now. Guess whos going to win that one?A life of living off the grid only to have what little social security benefits you have garnished at age  is no life at all.k   years is just about mo. You can make that even if they garnish your wages at a minimum wage day job while also delivering pizzas  nights a week.Its a shit hole of a  years to deal with and you truly dont deserve to have to go through it. Nobody does just because they wanted to better themselves with a higher education BUT the way the system works right now youre going to have little other recourse than repayment.  years of fucking shit hell then youre done and can move on with life.,studentloandefaulters,d03a3ug,2,t5_33jzs
