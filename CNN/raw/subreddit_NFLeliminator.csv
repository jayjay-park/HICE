1879444,0,t1_ckflnzb,Yes. I had a bad feeling about picking the Saints this week I want to save Seattle and Denver for a later game and I can see all of the other games going either way.Im not touching the Patriots until I have seen improvements in their oline and defense I picked the Phins last weekmaybe not the smartest move. I feel less bad about the Packers but I dont know what to make of the Jets at this point in the season.For me it is between the ers over Chicago Arizona over NYG and the Lions over the Panthers. That last one is just a gutfeeling that the Lions will win big in Charlotte and I like Arizona in NY better than San Fran.,NFLeliminator,ckfnzmy,2,t5_33e5o
