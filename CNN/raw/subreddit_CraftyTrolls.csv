10573178,0,t3_5re3r1,Im super proud of the tank top. I traced a design I found on Instagram onto a very cheap racerback tank with embroidery tracing paper ironed stabilizer onto the back and backstitched it. The cervix is a little lopsided because the pattern rubbed off there so I had to freehand it. But its still gonna be a bitchin protest shirt.The cross stitch was from this this free pattern and was great for using up some scraps from another project.,CraftyTrolls,dd6jgzp,2,t5_33q24
