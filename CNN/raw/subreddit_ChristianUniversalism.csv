618181,0,t3_1s9ckf,Original sin makes it impossible for humans to commune with God. Our humanity is what seperates us from God our flesh our worldly desires and our limited intelligence. God sent Christ to break down the wall that separates us from his glory. God made the way for us to commune with him we must walk the path. If we dont our SIN condemns us to hell. It has nothing to do with love or justice and it is simply a matter of our human inability to ascend to heaven through any path except the one that HE provided.,ChristianUniversalism,cgajdsl,1,t5_2spxl
1809434,0,t1_ck770e9,Ok so everything with aionios thats the Greek word normally behind eternal. Its a mistake to say that theyre mistranslated. It would be more accurate to say that they could be translated differently. Aionios can certainly mean eternal or everlasting but it also could mean something more like of the next age.We cant use the language of these verses to prove universalism only to allow for its possibility.,ChristianUniversalism,ck77lgo,6,t5_2spxl

11025271,0,t1_dehoolz,Matthew  | English Standard Version ESVgtEnter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life and those who find it are few.  Peter  | English Standard Version ESV PeterampversionESVgtFor if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled in them and overcome the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. What the true proverb says has happened to them The dog returns to its own vomit and the sow after washing herself returns to wallow in the mire.
