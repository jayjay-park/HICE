10508041,0,t1_dcyw08z,The problem is that we as a society are judging all police against those worst case scenarios. Its totally appropriate to demonstrate those because those are the type of scenarios the activist and others protest against. Plus they showed the worst cases in both ways officer is shot and officer shoots an unarmed man.I think the police can be too violent at times but its a super tough job with insanely high expectations. There are going to be mistakes but the underlying issue I think is that the mistakes tend to happen way more to minorities.,IWasWrongAllAlong,dcz74jt,8,t5_3isgp
10508232,0,t1_dcyw08z,I think thats the point though. Of all the police interactions with the public that happen every day statistically youre going to have an officer somewhere having their oneinamillion encounter where use of nonlethal force was impossible or ineffective. That doesnt mean that nonlethal options have no value it just means theyre not a perfect solution all the time.Theres a bit of negativity bias and confirmation bias involved in this issue too. Typically you only hear about the police encounters that go bad which just reinforces your already antipolice or antiuseofforce view.,IWasWrongAllAlong,dcz7wnr,3,t5_3isgp
10508989,0,t1_dcyni4q,He also says that we should go from one extreme to the other. Where the other extreme is legalization. I admit that legalizing without age restrictions and with nolow taxes would be extreme but legalizing it with an age restriction and taxing it so that its even less desireable for teenagers is just sensable.The gateway drug argument has also been around for a long time and people always site studies that show that a lot of hardcore drug addicts also smoke weed or smoked weed before. When looking at it the other way round  how many people who smoke weed also use hard drugs   you will see that it doesnt hold up. A lot of addicts also drink alcohol or smoke tabacco so by the same line of thinking those are gateway drugs also. Do the thousands of people that smoke tabacco and drink alcohol not show that this is bullshit? Well isnt the same true for weed?,IWasWrongAllAlong,dczazyv,1,t5_3isgp

10509444,0,t1_dcyo0ep,I also agree but feel that at least at the start a bit of leeway is worth having to generate content.Ill be adjusting the rules based on feedback like yours so in the future Ill probably limit posts like these.,IWasWrongAllAlong,dczcv0k,4,t5_3isgp
10529699,0,t1_dd1inf7,Just to reiterate what uMapleWhisky said please submit some content that goes against that trend. I submitted a Peter Hitchens interview where he talks about going from a Trotskyist to a conservative and its been upvoted.It doesnt have to be about politics either post a video of someone explaining their views on why they changed their mind about some historical topic thats up for debate tactics and strategies in sports anything is good for here.,IWasWrongAllAlong,dd1nmqr,11,t5_3isgp

10691135,0,t3_5rqupa,Very interesting clip thanks for posting.For anyone outside Australia the interviewer is Andrew Denton and this is I think his old show Enough Rope where hed speak to some of the worlds most interesting personalities. Great show been off air for a while now but nothing else aside from maybe  Minutes has been quite as good. Whats important to note here is the exaggeration. This KKK member was a hooded terror figure who was afraid of meeting a person he believed was a walking stereotype. Aside from the imagined death threats what was even scarybad about the black stereotypes he mentioned? Why cant a black guy hold a stereo on his shoulder or have an afro? This racist guy had been indoctrinated to be afraid of any indicators of blacknessblack culture. Its clear hed not met hardly any if any black people. His racism partially came from the racist exploitation of a lack of exposure. Even these days Ive met other white people who have been overwhelmed in the presence of an actual black person. The reverend gave him nothing to directly be afraid of but that wasnt an instant cure initially it provoked this man to do even worse things to black people.It shouldnt be overlooked that this reformed racist didnt just meet a kindly black person and rid himself of all prejudice because the black guy acted proper which is basically what hes saying at the start. This man went on to commit an act of terror in burning the reverends church. It also shouldnt be overlooked that the reverend may have still been traumatised or deeply hurt by the things this man did to him. I think its also important to note how Denton does not laugh along with most of the anecdotes here. If its all a roaring good time like LOL REMEMBER RACISM?? it overshadows the real message here the reverend didnt cure someone of their racism he wore them down until their hatred was a pure inconvenience. If their hatred had any space to breed or fester his nonreactions wouldnt have stopped them. Indeed they didnt at first he had to put up with a lot of threats and attacks before they eventually gave up.And finally the KKK still exists. It was not destroyed.,IWasWrongAllAlong,ddipmpx,3,t5_3isgp
