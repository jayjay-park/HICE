4109998,0,t3_37porl,We had a tub and despite some issues I found it helpful. The midwife brought it to our home at our  week appointment so it was there ready to set up. I started having contractions on my due date didnt deliver till  so my husband set it up then to be ready for go time. We filled it the night I went into real labor. We live in a small two family home and the water tank situation was abysmal for filling the tub but with pots of water on the stove we made it work! I didnt deliver in the tub but it did ease the harder parts of labor. Labor typically takes many hours so you have time to fill it once you know its the real deal and you dont want to use it too soon anyway as it can slow things down. All in all Id say it was worth it for us. ,homebirth,crorjqs,4,t5_2rt2f
