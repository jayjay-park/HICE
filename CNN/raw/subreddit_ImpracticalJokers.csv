7605570,0,t1_d36p8cj,I feel the editing has become better as we get two full challenges with each Jokers turn rather than short clips of three or four challenges with a random Jokers turn not included. Considering the show is realistically  minutes long in total there isnt enough time to include  of every challenge especially if they spent hours filming each one. I think the cue card challenges are the most unpopular among fans out of all the challenges they do. I know that Qs sex ed powerpoint presentation got shown on the tour in full so maybe more of them will be featured in later shows too. I know the whole of The Remarkable Misadventures of Q the Dung Beetle is avaliable on the website of the artist who drew the artwork for itSal only had to dig through nasty things four times  once was just picking up poop and the other was just to get his hands dirty so he would use the bathroom. The punishments which are different to what Jokers think they will be are most effective when the Joker doesnt know it will be switched otherwise they would never be enthusiastic like Joe jumping out of the cake in front of war veterans. There does need to be a balance between them I suppose. The DVDs should maybe include featurelength challenges but when nothing is happening then there would be a lot of dead air. When they are not actively filming you can see them eating or texting or reading rather than doing anything amusing.The shows are filmed entirely out of order most visible in earlier seasons with Qs facial hair being inconsistent so it is impossible for them to always wear summer or winter clothing for an entire episode. The format wouldnt work if they filmed everything in a precise order but it has been that way since the very start so I guess its here to stay. Only ... the Texas  New Orleans  Miami  London episodes will have guaranteed losers filmed in the correct order deliberately. ,ImpracticalJokers,d36ppcw,1,t5_2tfkd

X punishments so they film like that.Qs thumbs up in challenges percentage is . compared to Murrs . and Q has had  punishments while Sal has had .Joes Putting the P in Pool punishment was filmed around the time of a Season  challenge but only got aired this season so who knows how they put it all together.,ImpracticalJokers,d8bkjhb,16,t5_2tfkd

11177661,0,t1_deyyh3o,I dont think its that cut and dry. I imagine if they could they would add  minutes extra of Jokers but I would expect that the Jokers contract covers a certain time of show and if they add  more minutes of their bits it would cost the network even more. Ontop of the lost revenue from the reduced Ad Time. Im sure  camera and Casey Jost is significantly cheaper. And id definitely take Jost over the  minutes of ads.
