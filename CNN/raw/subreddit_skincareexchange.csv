10629583,0,t1_ddbips9,What kind of products are you looking for?For cleansers and moisturizers Sebamed is a good brand since the pH is ..  Balea ultra sensitiv or Alverde ultra sensitiv are also good products.  Some of the Alverde creams have alcohol in them which can be a little drying but the other ingredients might balance that out.  Its up to you whether you want to use them.  Avene and La RochePorsay sell really nice products.  Brands like Nivea and Eucerin can be nice as well but youll have to look through the ingredients and try them out.For exfoliating maybe try a urea cream since they are so widely available.  I know Balea and Sebamed sell urea creams.You could also see if you can can get tretinoin.  Not sure if you have to go to the doctor for that?  It also exfoliates and smooths out your skin.For sunscreens you have a wide range of options.  Anything SPF  and with the UVA circle gives you good protection.  La RochePorsay Avene Vichy Eucerin all sell popular sunscreens.,skincareexchange,ddcczr5,2,t5_2xh8c
