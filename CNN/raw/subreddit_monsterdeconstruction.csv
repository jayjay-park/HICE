3797352,0,t1_cqp4dtu,Touche.  I forgot about the speederbike incident in particular.  I guess we could say it would be a highly developed tribe.  I guess we could speculate they made a divergent evolution but still have most humanlike qualities. ,monsterdeconstruction,cqp4mju,1,t5_37rxz

3849746,0,t3_34ip00,The mouth extends past the furry barrier when it desires to eat layers of scum off cave or aquatic floors. Most likely most likely blind and its eye acts like an attractant towards prey. Slow moving and about  feet long.,monsterdeconstruction,cqv3toz,2,t5_37rxz
3852168,0,t1_cqv3pb1,This brings up a lot of interesting points. Could you go more in depth with that last paragraph? Do you mean that they are simply globs of random life force or more structured? And they exist to do only one purpose how like their only job would be turn a wheel in a machine or is it broader than that? ,monsterdeconstruction,cqvds0h,2,t5_37rxz
4037284,0,t3_36hmfm,Deus Ex Machina powers!Its weird they establish that Shenron cannot do anything that exceeds the power of his creator Kami. Yet he brings back thousands if not millions of people on a whim restores planets but somehow doesnt have the power to kill Vegeta and Nappa or to make the Androids human again despite the fact they were once human. Team Four Star says it the best I cant kill them directly but one crossed wire in their spaceships and BOOM right into a star. Shenrons powers are vague at best. Also the implication is that Kami is powerful enough to bring people back from the dead and restore entire planets.,monsterdeconstruction,crghbr2,2,t5_37rxz
4459063,0,t1_cssqfi5,Actually wait. Scratch that.  Whales carry their voices because it is underwater and I am sure that dolphin echolocation is somewhat similar.  But the point still stands.  It can def be both. ,monsterdeconstruction,cssquye,1,t5_37rxz
6516232,0,t1_czt595n,Huh wow.That is incredibly interesting Im absolutely going to make that true for this creature!As I dont personally know much on this subject its been fascinating to hear from you.I reckon this creature could use a combination of all of those functions thus creating an appropriate monstrosity for an incredibly harsh climate.Thanks again!,monsterdeconstruction,cztbuwa,2,t5_37rxz

7021504,0,t3_4396eo,Transformers could crossover with star wars Cybertron could be in the unknown regions plus if they go the idea that the transformers arent machines but some form of Robot like life form this has been the case in most newer transformers series with their own genetic information call CNA in the comics then some transformers may be able to use the force. Also the seekers would probably be tie fighters and the aerialbots xwings.,monsterdeconstruction,d1c8lkg,2,t5_37rxz

8577007,0,t3_4x47nf,I wouldnt see them moving like animals with endoskeletons and fibres pulling the bones into new positions.  More likely theyd move like insects with exoskeletons bark? and pushing fluid around to inflatedeflate joints.  Perhaps it started with lightsensitive spots on the surface of a Sprig that stimulated moving fluids towards the lighter surface  this would move the centre of gravity for a sprig causing it to roll out of the shade of the parent plant and the sprig gets more sunlight.  This insures more of the plants children get better resources and expand the occupied territory over generations.  Sprigs that have more sophisticated lightsensing surfaces and fluidmoving mechanics will get better spots to grow and are more likely to survive encouraging the traits of improved protovision and mobility.Fastforward to a time when these sprigs are a threat carnivorelike hunters.  They still move towards stimulus moving fluids around to continuously fall over in that direction but shaped like a ball or tumbleweed so they keep rolling.  They have barbed surfaces now like burrburrs or cacti and would roll into animals to envelop them holding them fast.   The animal struggles giving more chances for the barbs to catch more animal skin.  Eventually the animal is held fast unable to escape to eat or drink and expires.  The minerals and fluids of the expiring creature will be like fertilizer that the sprig seeks out instead of passively absorbing from the soilbed theyre stuck in.,monsterdeconstruction,d6dpjjp,2,t5_37rxz
