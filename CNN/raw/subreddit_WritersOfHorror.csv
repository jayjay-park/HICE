And in case you havent heres the link to it Im working on being able to let viewers add comments. ,WritersOfHorror,cglkgv6,2,t5_2vhmy

6778594,0,t3_48ll79,This isnt crappy at all actually. I just wouldnt call it a draft of a story though. This reads more like an outline for a horrorfantasy novel which youve painted three very interesting and unsettling scenes. If you were to expand this into a full length novel I think youd be able to use the above three paragraphs as difference scenes for the adventure while still conveying dread and horror. Or if you turned all three paragraphs into a short story set in this other world corrupted by foul magic it would work out well too. ,WritersOfHorror,d0kmyfn,3,t5_2vhmy
