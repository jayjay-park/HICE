6920201,0,t3_4aiqca,Traveling to Bridgetown in April. Great tips btw.... So I read about visiting Carlisle Bay and Miami Beach but are there any beaches you found off the beaten path that are definitely worth a visit that are remote with fewer people?Any limits on bringing the rum back to the US I read somewhere you can only bring back one liter per person?Do you know if you could bring cigars from the US with you to Barbados. I know this ma seem like reverse course but Id like to have a few casual cigars throughout my week without paying Cuban Prices?,Barbados,d10q8fd,1,t5_2s8xj

Obviously only go in very calm areas and stick very close to shore. If you get swept away at night noone will notice. the sea has no back door  as we say here.,Barbados,d7brszv,3,t5_2s8xj
