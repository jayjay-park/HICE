3254914,0,t3_2xdyek, No you cant make it so one device has write access if you lock a tag it is locked. However if you write a url you can always change what that url directs to! If the tag is locked you cant rewrite it ever. If you left it unlocked you can potentially rewrite the tag every  seconds but the tag has no power or computational abilities so it cant rewrite itself. You can run a script in the browser or server that updated every  seconds again if you encode a url. Not really if your device is in the range of more than  tag you will get errors or it will read  of the tags. No the device powers the tag and reads its contents. If you are writing to the tag then it emits another signal to write the tag. But the tag isnt being constantly read. Currently you cant have a task that runs right after an interaction. The whole idea of tasker is that the data on the tag hold information that makes your phone do something so you cant really create a delay with that app.,NFC,cozdrso,6,t5_2sc6j

6641478,0,t1_d063yus,gt Good point NXP is necessary but not sufficient. But you get my point that some Android devices can go beyond just anticollision with Mifare Classic tags.Yes you can but the controller has to support it and explicit support has to be present in the version of Android on that phone hence why I said so unless explicit support is added for it Android devices can perform an anticollision and thats it. Back when the PNlibnfcnxp were the only game in town most phones had that support but these days its much less likely.gtIts certainly muddled but thats part of the point Im trying to make in my original reply. Classifying NFC as only those tags that support the NFC Forum tag types is overly conservative.Yeah I agree although for purposes most common uses with Android phones the NFC Forum types are probably the most useful definition. If your goal is absolute technical accuracy everything is pretty terrible. Arguably ISO doesnt even encompass NFC as you could make the case that ISO should be considered NFC as well.,NFC,d06abj3,1,t5_2sc6j
9956207,0,t1_db57o4q,The problem is we recently got a batch of NFC tags and when we tested them with the various Andriod phones around the office some didnt function despite having NFC enabled.  We noticed that the ones not working had versions inferior to Lollipop.,NFC,db5bhn9,1,t5_2sc6j
9968746,0,t1_db6gi1o,gt By simply tapping the tags with different phones and checking what versione of Android they have.This isnt really a very good test. If you tap a tag that the phone can communicate with just fine but it cant make sense of the data on the tag the phone will make an unhappy sound instead of the usual happy sound it makes when you scan a tag. If you tap a tag that the phone can detect but cant communicate with at all it will make the exact same unhappy sound. So you have no way of knowing if its an issue between the phone and a tag or an issue between the phone and the tags data.gt  We havent tried swapping out the batteries. Is a faulty battery a common cause for an NFC sensor not working?It depends on the phone. Samsung used to put their NFC antennas on their batteries and occasionally these antennas would get damaged which could then be fixed by installing a new battery. This also tended to mean that the antenna was in a strange spot toward the bottom of the phone which caused other problems as people would often tap the tag with the wrong part of their device. Phones with removable batteries may still do this but phones with nonremovable batteries will usually have the antenna somewhere else.gt I had no idea there are all these different types of NFC chips! Are these all made by NXP and are these all current models or some not really produced anymore?This covers some of the basics of what the classifications of tags out there are. NXP makes several different types of type  type  and ISO tags in addition to their proprietary Classic. While they have retired a few models here and there most of the new tags are backwards compatible with older ones like the MIFARE Plus which replaced the Classic. There are competitors to NXP but their tags are much less common. Sony FeliCas type  and Broadcom JewelTopaz type  are probably the most notable alternatives.gt Is the Classic Protocol still widely used or is it old technology that only exists in older phones?Classics have massive security holes which along with the phone chipset compatibility issue have made them largely fall out of common usage. Occasionally people buy them because they provide a high memory capacity at low cost but the compatibility and security issues heavily limit where they are an appropriate choice also the very cheap NTAG can be used instead for some of those higher memory applications without the compatibility problems.gt What is considered semimodern? So it is possible that the problem is with what version of Android a phone has?Prior to version . Android didnt support NFC and the initial support was much more limited than what was added in ... So if youre using a phone from  or earlier theres a chance that the OS doesnt support the NFC operations youre trying to do.,NFC,db6yct7,2,t5_2sc6j
