3153355,0,t1_coo2ajg,Yeah I dont know. Its an interesting question. In regards to your link I think at this point its just an original song! Just cause it samples some vocals and instrumentals doesnt make it a mashup to me. But a lot of remixes are  original except the vocal stems  so I dont know. But even THEN some original tracks are completely built off sample and no one called it a mashup a la Duck Sauces Barabara Streisand  People like kid  have been doing stuff like this for a long time now and no one ever called them mashups. At this point its a rant but I do think the original post is a remix more than anything else.,mashups,cooucwd,1,t5_2r2kq

3296832,0,t3_2xvql6,Definitely agree with uMrKitteh on the YOOuuuuuuUUOOO part. Every time it comes in it distracts me from the song cause it doesnt fit at all. Also the ending was a bit weak in my opinion. It just fades out and makes the mashup feel like a preview instead of a whole mashup.Otherwise the mashup is okay. Some parts worked and some didnt. Im not saying it is bad though!,mashups,cp42d12,1,t5_2r2kq

6386838,0,t3_435gn8,Because people have no imagination or they are going after artists who are currently viral  say Lady Gaga when she was big or Gangnam Style or whatever. At the moment it seems like every second mashup is The Weeknd? Boring. Chasing those clicks.Most modern pop is easy to mash its all so similar...its not like its Beach Boys  God Only Knows or Blur or Queen  Bohemian Rhapsody there arent usually any key changes and the chord structure is usually similar to other pop fare tempo doesnt change its metronomic to an EDM  beat. Its why Im less than impressed with modern multimashes   its not like its Hank Handy doing the Beatles where the structures are all dissimilar  that was difficult and impressive. I mean you even have SOFTWARE Mixmeister? Chord and key databases now to tell you what to mash together. Lazy and so so obvious.Newbies seem to put their nose up at old mashups but those were done without stems without Live without Melodyne without Autotune and usually with some crappy kbs acapella...whereas now its easy to put EDM vs pop hit the parts and software are just there so people churn out the same old  even exactly the same combinations as  years ago  quickly and at high quality but to me its lost a lot of the invention. I.e. The need to do crazy things because youre working from edits only from the original track or filtering an acapella because its a DIY or echoing and putting FX to hide all the claps and crap on the original parts or suddenly double time or glitch because of tempo issues that sort of thing. Or just working with crazy combinations  that only seems to happen with soundclown and crumpl stuff now? Or YouTubePoop stuff.,mashups,czfm7v8,5,t5_2r2kq
