This is mildly annoying though since I rely on this thing to let me know when actual new mod mail comes in example if someone reports something that needs immediate moderator attention and sends us a moderation mail about it and now I cant do that. ,toolbox,cgu5iik,1,t5_2rko7
1088544,0,t3_26kg4t,gt  In Removal Reasons loglink return giberish instead of a link to the removal log. Its not gibberish!gt We also worked in a new support feature.

1219087,0,t1_ci6qey9,Entitlement is also immature.  Do you have any context as to the amount of my free time I spend writing tools to make your life easier?  Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of our free time has been spent working on something well happily give you for free.How do you respond to that?  By being a rude and entitled douche bag.  Im more than happy to fix your bug but nothing obligates me being nice to you if you cant take the time to not phase things like a flaming fucking asshole.,toolbox,ci6rkml,2,t5_2rko7

4920552,0,t3_3i7i87,Actually you very nearly can achieve what you want by creating AM rules that to do the dirty work when it sees a particular key word in a comment instead of using the removal reasons basically you transfer your reasons to a set of rules in AM and dont use toolbox to remove. You gain a lot of flexibility this way because AM can do everything that toolbox does and more.AM takes over when it sees the trigger keyword your comment  it can even remove yours so that noone sees it. And if you want to get doubly tricky AM can also look at the flair class of the post when it sees the comment so you could use that to pass additional information to AM.Heres a rule I use to filter posts remove them and push into the mod queue for review when Im using a mobile client that doesnt support modding     Filter    type comment    istoplevel true    moderatorsexempt false    body regex filterW.    author        ismoderator true    parentsubmission        action filter        actionreason author filtered match    action remove    actionreason mod command    So then thisFilter Unverified picResults in it appearing in the mod queue with gtAutomod action MissionaryControl filtered Unverified picOf course thats set up to allow us to doublehandle the post e.g. message OP to remove the pic and we can reapprove it... you may prefer to action remove instead of filter.Now to get AM to make a sibling toplevel comment requires an extra couple of steps as seen in this sequence of cascading rules that trigger each other Automatically verify!! Verification round   mod trigger comment     type comment    body includes Verified!    priority     istoplevel true    author        flaircssclass mod     parentsubmission        flaircssclass pending   lt NOTE THAT THIS IS A CONDITION NOT A COMMAND.        setflair Processingapproved   lt THIS IS THE COMMAND.

Your flair should update shortly if it hasnt already allowing you to post more pictures without the need for tags.          Please be aware that moderators may refer to both this post and your matchurl verification in comparison to future submissions so do not delete them or you may have to reverify.     Simple explanationStep  AM responds to the keyword in your comment to set a temporary trigger flair on the OP AND reports the comment so that AM will look at it again in step .Step  AM responds to the report on the comment and based on the trigger flair on OP set in rule  updates the flair to the final state in our case but it could be another instruction trigger for step  if you wanted AND reports the parent submission so that AM will look at that in step .Step  AM responds to the report on the parent submission at which time it can leave a response and magically update the OPs flair as well  something AM theoretically cant do from a comment. Now at each stage you can have multiple paths down which AM can go  by having multiple rules for steps   and  with relevant keywords and flair types so that AM will pick the action it needs to take.We use step three to approve but you could just as easily remove.IIRC there may be some issues if you have already approved the post because AM gets a bit stubborn about what it will do after a real live mod has already been poking at a post. Cant recall exactly but you might find it doesnt work on posts that have already been approved in the same way that you cant get AM to look at a post that has been removed.HMU if you need a hand to tweak it but you should be able to see how it all works...,toolbox,cuervr9,2,t5_2rko7
