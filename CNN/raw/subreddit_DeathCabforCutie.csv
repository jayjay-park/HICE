2393008,0,t3_2ms9fz,Yea this song is told completely from another persons point of view that had nothing do do with the relationship most likely a friend of the subject. The first part of the song is when the narrator is reading off what the person wrote on the sign.And I hope you have more luck with this than me.  As for the verse And I try not to worry but youve got me terrified. Its like youre in some kind of hurry to say goodbye this part is when the narrator is speaking to the subject in first person.Ive always assumed this verse was about the subject saying goodbye to love entirely or even worse committing suicide. What leaves me to think that it is the latter is the narrator saying youve got me terrified. Terrified that his close friend is about to kill themselves because they are so lonely,DeathCabforCutie,cm7hei9,3,t5_2tm9k

3478704,0,t3_303da9,I do agree. I really miss his old voice. You know whats crazy. Ben has always swayed back and forthhad a shaky voice during live performances. But it was never present on the albums. Until Narrow Stairs was released. From then on it was completely noticeable. I always associated his sudden vocal change with his massive weight loss. Im almost positive thats what happened. ,DeathCabforCutie,cposqe4,4,t5_2tm9k

7460781,0,t1_d2q42wl,Thanks for sharing! Never heard an acoustic version of this song before and it was really nice to listen to. Although Im not a huge fan of Stable Song and havent actually heard Stability might give it a listen now though Im the queen of tinfoil theories about lyrics and enjoyed reading yours. I do think a lot of the songs weave in and out of each other like that more than people realize. I really like your mention of how it would explain the when I awoke I was on... because A Movie Script Ending as it were never totally explains that. Interesting thoughts.,DeathCabforCutie,d2q8t4i,1,t5_2tm9k
7773365,0,t3_4lkcn2,I felt like the songs flowed well in the previous albums especially Transatlanticism and Plans. With Kintsugi I dont know it didnt feel like the flow was there. There were songs were good for sure but I dont know something was lacking. Not sure if it was the flow or what. Maybe a little be less electronics.But I dont think it would be a DCFC album without the band deciding what to do  of the way.,DeathCabforCutie,d3prosk,1,t5_2tm9k
7882595,0,t3_4n65ap,Best show will always be the first time I saw them at Glastonbury Festival last year  Id always wanted to see them since I first listened to Narrow Stairs but never had anyone to go with me and Id always be late on getting tickets.  I was right at the front I could almost touch the beautiful Gibbles. I was so overwhelmed by their live sound their look and the atmosphere everything... They ended with Transatlanticism it hit me hard. As soon as they finished they were as glorious as I always imagined them to be and I broke down. Got so excited and hyped from seeing them I managed to get tickets to see them in London Brixton a couple of months later.  Always excited when I hear theyre touring in the UK now.,DeathCabforCutie,d422s17,2,t5_2tm9k

8559209,0,t1_d6be7qs,This is part of it but I genuinely dont think their later stuff codes and keys kintsugi has the same ingenuity or musical intelligence as their earlier work. Even songs like Amputations Stability and President of What? that arent very polished or sophisticated at all seem to me to have more humanity in them meaning glimpses into the souls of those who poured there intelligence and passion into them see Transatlanticism What Sarah Said than songs like Little Wanderer and Codes and Keys. I feel as though the band has slowly becomes more worried about polish and producing even pettiness which you can see in how Ben characterises his relationship with Zooey than being a family thats just trying to put their souls onto an track. ,DeathCabforCutie,d6bh7pu,10,t5_2tm9k
