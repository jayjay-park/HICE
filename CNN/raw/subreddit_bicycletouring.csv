201624,1,t1_cf1e0ys,gtI guess I can feel good supporting a small beginning business.Its nice to get off on the right foot with a new LBS but theres no such thing as a firm price! She may say that the price is firm but theres a lot to haggle there especially since its obvious that the bike is put together from parts she had lying around and that she could sell it for a hundred or two less and still make a profit. Firstly those pukegreen pedals will have to go! Those mismatched fenders will have to be seen to does it rain in Milwaukee?   that front may look nice but its really inefficient! and I bet that saddle will ensure you dont have kids....Its what its worth to you thats important. Go have a look at the bike by all means if its in your area. Chances are that the girl is an awesome dude and will swap over some parts if it means keeping the price at  in her favour. Work with her and chances are youll be leaving the shop with an awesome new bike!And Welcome! o,bicycletouring,cf1eoth,0,t5_2sdwm

Though I just stated all the bad stuff Its a great way to travel especially with bulky items like bikes. There is a lot of room and watching the country go by is worth it alone.Also At night I usually take out my sleeping pad and head to the empty viewing car and lay down on the floor for better rest than in a seat.

I feel like I am pretty tough and quite talented with two wheels off road.  With a light load I think I would really enjoy riding this bike around for a while.

The frame will be lighter than a dedicated tourer like the ubiquitous LHT but remember that you wont be touring on your bike every day of the year so should choose a bike that suits your everyday needs with touring as a secondary consideration. gtIs the chainstay long enough to avoid heelstrike?This picture of a beautifully built up kaffenback shows that theres little heel clearance.

451304,0,t1_cfrj3n5,ltdisclaimergtSorry for the wall of text that follows dont feel obligated to reply since I wasnt OP and I kind of picked on your opinion out of nowhere.  Thats just what this is though my opinion.  Im not going to try to force you to do anything youre an adult and can make your own decisions.ltenddisclaimergtIm not here to do research for you.  You can make your own conclusions of the effectiveness of helmets and decide for yourself.  That said considering how easy it is to wear a helmet with very few drawbacks regardless of how small the benefits may be I believe wearing one to be totally worth it.In terms lacerations elsewhere we do indeed take preventative measures against them.  Clothing particularly shirts since we cant really legally ride without pants we all wear them partially to protect against minor lacerations.  Now they serve multiple functions sunburn wicking sweat etc. but most definitely help add protection.  I mean thats partially why clothing exists in the first place.  Clothing didnt come around to protect others eyes from our bits and pieces it served as protection to us from sun cold insects cuts and scrapes whatever.  Biking gloves most of our wipeouts end with our hands on the ground and a very large majority of mountain bikers wear and many road riders at least half finger gloves if not full often without padding so it isnt just a matter of comfort to prevent ripping open our hands.  And touring is a relatively safe biking sport in terms of straight crashes since you are going at lower speeds typically but step up the speed and make the terrain rougher and you get bikers wearing full face helmets and shin pads to prevent pedal strikes.  Much of these things are often put to the side for touring since its added benefits arent worth the inconveniences for an unlikely event but something as light weight and simple as a helmet isnt really something in my opinion that should be overlooked.,bicycletouring,cfrk8fq,3,t5_2sdwm

Riders aim to complete the course within specified time limits and receive equal recognition regardless of their finishing order. Riders may travel in groups or alone as they wish and are expected to be selfsufficient between controls. A randonneuring event is called a randone brevet or sometimes by the more general term cyclosportive and a rider who has completed a km event is called a randonneur.

982391,0,t1_chfy1i5,Well at the end of the day it is a set of wheels its not like you couldnt just buy new ones for the same bike. If  tubes are close enough to work then I think it sounds like a goer that is the most common thing you are going to need.I am riding long distance on C in Asia and have had issues with the spokes tyres tubes also valve size my front wheel is presta. It was basically impossible to find this stuff after Austria there was only Dubai and then... Thailand. A bit of stuff hacked together in China. And even there they didnt have what I wanted although the Panaracer xs I got to replace my Marathon xs are really great tyres at half the price and lighter and much faster and better on tarmac. I imagine these issues would be even worse on B but if you are not doing a long tour in remote places where you expect to wear out and replace stuff this shouldnt be an issue. The main issue I have using C rather than  is that I do need to carry more spares than I would otherwise like a complete spare tyre and Ive needed it in a India after a ripped sidewall. If I was on  I could just get a new tyre locally. It would be a shit tyre but it would get me the next km or whatever to get a decent one. On C if I dont have the spare I would be taking the bus. ,bicycletouring,chfyf9j,2,t5_2sdwm

1334625,0,t1_cijku1u,Keep riding it loaded. Eventually youll get the hang of it as your strength and reflexes adapt. Youll also develop the desire to center and balance your load more. You can do this by packing heavy stuff at the bottom of the bags packing pairs of items of roughly equal weight between the two sides. Youll also develop an opinion about whether more weight should be on the front or the back panniers. Youll get a front rack eventually. We all do. You will insist that you are correct.

1709940,0,t3_2dzqdy,Heres the stuff I would take and how I would get it. Keep in mind this is my take on it and this isnt an absolute minimum list Bike  Start looking through your local Craigslist. You could do k on a Marin Muirwoods which are about  new so.. ish reasonably used?EDIT Bike Tools Pump Patch Kits and Tubes Rack  This is about  per rack so used or new here Panniers  If you can find used ones that are waterproof then go with them. Everyone will say Ortliebs here but youll find a few who mention Axiom or Arkel  get one front and rear Dry bag  if you need a further one  head to the paddlingwatersport section for it. In my local MEC they are under . Handlebar bag  I personally dont have one but many people swear by them  CL find perhaps? Tent  Again see if there are craigslist finds for a one person one. Sleeping bag  Perhaps go new here to avoid bed bugs Cooking  You could make a cat can stove or get an alcohol stove. LPG stoves start at about  but I would spend  on a small one. Other items bowls knife and fork etc are inexpensive. Water Bottles  Buy these as they will save you money over expensive bottled water. Clothes  Do you have any gym shirts? Those will do. Close fitting shorts also important. Navigation  There are lots of mapping apps for smartphones or tablets out there. My other posts have some history on this. Whatever you choose find something that does offline maps and can use OpenCycleMap data. An app should cost about  but a single paper map costs that. If you can afford it get an external battery pack or better still a solar charger see the Wirecutters article and a good multiport charger Anker have a good one Travel guides WikiVoyage and many many others for free advice LonelyPlanet eBooks for paid versions. Actually that leads me onto... Tablet andor smartphone  Im mentioning these as they can save you more money than they cost. A tablet for example can be your navigator above your emailFacebookreddit device when you stop for lunch something to read books on cheaply on in camp a way of writing on your blog making free SkypeGoogle Hangouts calls home and researching your next move. It can also be less weight than even one travel book. I personally have a Nexus  for this. However I cannot say they are mandatory.  Camera Laptop Music Headphones etc  Take what you currently have if reasonable. If you have an enormous laptop perhaps send that ahead or sell it. You might want something to email from and blog with a lot of people like Chromebooks. However I cannot say they are mandatory.  Helmet  DO NOT REPEAT DO NOT skimp on this. Buy new and fitted properly. Lights and reflectors  Get some decent ones too I spent about  on a good front and rear set of lights that are USB rechargeable and rechargeable batteries save money Sunglasses  again going to be on your face every day. Perhaps you have some already? Suncream and bug spray  dont be unsafe with the sun and dont let mosquitoes annoy you.  Towel and Toiletries  I would recommend getting a light travel towel microfibre that folds up tiny and dries quick and obviously toiletries. First aid kit  Again a light one will make your life happier if you take a big spill. Money  it sounds like you are selling up from your current city. Get all of your stuff on Craigslist and see what sells. Get your friends round and say take what you want but give me a bit of cash for your less prized stuff better still if they have just arrived they get a bargain out of it and are on a better footing for later  when I moved to my town a friend did this and Im still grateful to this day. You might even be able to trade some things.Ask around friends. Some might have some of this stuff available for long term loan or trade see that Money thing. Also go to your local university bike shop or coop to see if they can advise. They are used to seeing people with less income. Also free classes might be available on bike maintenance etc.Finally check out Tom Allens website for lots of budget travel advice ,bicycletouring,cjup7fy,24,t5_2sdwm

They tend to be small grouped together sites with only a few tables that lends itself well to being social.

I found myself falling into a group of four to six others who traveled about the same mileage I liked to travel. Being at the same campsites as them for several days at a time I got to know them fairly well.In contrast when traveling North you tend to meet a whole new group of people every night.,bicycletouring,cm9d71s,2,t5_2sdwm

2573429,0,t1_cmuhcme,I was talking about bikes in general here. I guess its partly my own perception as well because when I do research about bikes and gear and what to bring etc I instantly exclude most things in the touring section because from my point of view they are automatically unsuited for what I do. Too heavy. not necessarily the frame material but the extras on the bike like lights fenders and kickstands disqualify it for meThe last two companies that sponsored me Quantec and Carver dont even have a single steelframe bicycle in their product line. ,bicycletouring,cmuhh7o,1,t5_2sdwm
2574266,0,t1_cmukums,I wouldnt trust the Thule pack and pedal. Its ok for randonneuring but I wouldnt trust the outcome of the tour on one.Road bikes have a different geometry which really is key here. They are not meant to be touring bicycles. And having a carbon frame and strapping  panniers on it woud be... stupid. The carbon is most likely not made for the stress and the weight panniers put on it and there is no easy way to repair it. But you would save a kg in frame material.And I cant accept to agree to disagree on the comfort thing. You may be used to a road racing bicycle and dont mind pain but BY DEFINITION comfort is not an objective on a racing bike. And by definition a touring bike has a more relaxed geometry because of the comfort. You may feel more at home on a racing bike but thats it. Even on your fully suspended bike you most definately have a different body position arguably more comfortable because it is not meant to be as aerodynamic as possible.And just to add yes. Yes road bikes have less space even if you do add a rear rack. The chainstays are shorter so you have to use smaller panniers because otherwise your heel would hit them with every revolution. And I havent seen a road bike with lowrider braze ons on the fork. Toe overlap is also much more of an issue on a road bike. The steering is more twitchy or faster and nervous.,bicycletouring,cmulf2d,1,t5_2sdwm

If you have a Google account it just syncs your routes from your computer and it gives you the directions directly on your smartphone. You can even save a part of the map to your iPhone so you dont have to have an internet connection.An alternative would be apps that use data from Open Street Map an free amp open map provider. Many apps support an offline mode but in my experiences many of them cant give you directions as good as Google Maps. Although OpenStreetMap itself is free to use some apps still cost but many are worth a buy. I can recommend this appeditJust realized thats kinda pointless to link to the Google play store.

If youre in a beautiful area and want to take a walk you wont be disappointed. I cant think of any particular ones that Id recommend over anywhere else. There arent really so many paths or trails around but if you see a mountain and a way up without causing damage to the fragile vegetation have a go at it.I guess it wouldnt hurt to stop in Skaftafell for  or  days walk to Svartifoss or to the top of Kristnartindar or Svnafellsjkull.If youre not going as far east as Skaftafell you could go to akgil and walk up somewhere to get a view of Ktlujkull really breathtaking view.Then if youre going further east the Eastern fjords are just incredible. If youre near Grundafjrur in Snfellsnes in the west and if youre up for a bit of a challenging hikescramble you can walk up Kirkjufell one of the most posted mountain in rearthporn. Otherwise and for an easier walk you could walk straight up into the mountains south of Grundafjrur. I dont know its hard to pick out a few possibilities theyre just all over the place. Just be sure you can go back down and that you dont get lost. A few people die here every year from overestimating their abilities and underestimating the nature.F is definitely a more scenic road than the road nr.  alternative. Way more scenic but tough. I think you can find a video somewhere of guys touring F on fixies. something like Fix Iceland tour but Im not sure. Whats your logistics problem?

3236775,0,t3_2x6pen,Im using a Scott Torus right now  On the cons side it could be better ventilated on the plus side it has MIPS which helps somewhat reduce concussions in the most common types of impacts where your head rotates down to the ground and not directly impacts something is made of durable plastic and not just a thin veneer to handle daily abuse and bumps from being thrown around the round shape reduces the likelihood of the helmet snapping on impact due to the elongations from aero designs and while I have yet to make use of it there is a strap in the year for hanging a blinky off of if you need extra night visibility. While it is true that most helmets are all the same protective foam tested to an outdated standard there are now a few from several brands that have an extra MIPS system. And while the data is still thin on how effective it actually is at reducing concussion risks while also still providing impact protection it does at least definitely do that better than a standard helmet and represents the first true effort by the market to offer us anything better safetywise since helmets became standardized so its worth supporting with a little money if you can find one and swing it. ,bicycletouring,coxhyi8,1,t5_2sdwm

The achilles is very slow to heal as there is no direct blood flow to it so best not to let this get any worse. I did a few things to reduce tension on my achilles to give them a chance at healingMoved clips towards the back of my shoes quite significantly to reduce pressure on achilles.Exaggeratedly my toe pointing down while peddling to reduce pressure on Achilles especially when applying a lot of load.   LOOSEN YOUR CALVES...Soleus and gastrocs both.. For me at least I think my calves were so tight that it caused a lot of tension on the Achilles that plus biking and running caused them to be forcibly stretched aggravated and inflamed. . Get massage to loosen them up. I am positive my injuries could have been avoided altogether by simply stretching. If you can stretch your calves without further aggravating your Achilles it will make a big difference.  Be really careful as it could make things worse.  Then ice. On my road to recovery stretching was key. Ice use it after every ride stretching You can add a wedge under your the heel of your shoe when you are walking around. It will take pressure off it. should only be used short term. Acupuncture. something to think about if it gets worse.  I had significant swelling in mine they were  times thicker than normal  and I was skeptical at first that Acupuncture would help but it really seemed to. Could have been fluke but it was dramatic. A lot of the pain was caused by my tendon being too big for the sheath that it fits in so reducing inflammation was very important. oops just saw you are biking in sandles.

I tried the UE boom because wirecutter recommended it and found the battery life to be inadequate  hours battery life advertised maybe at half volume with road noise you need to crank anything pretty much to full volume in the city and that really drains the battery I found to maybe an hour. The Fugoo has a sleeve system of varying degrees of toughness I have the toughest one because I beat things up but for a bike tour you could definitely get away with the middle option called sport an advertised  hour battery life at full volume probably more like  maybe? Still by far better than anything else Ive seen.Everything else about it is pretty great too water and shock proof sounds great. I took it on a tour down the pacific coast last summer with pretty spotty access to power and went days without charging it and listened to music off and on everyday at mostly full volume and ran out of juice maybe once in three weeks.Oh did I mention they sell a bike mount for it?!

3827607,0,t1_cqskevl,Be careful not to order a new chain and change it in the middle of nowhere as if your chainrings or cassette is too worn you will experience skips the chain will jump on each worn tooth and its bad. Its hard even for an experienced mechanic to see if a cassette or chainring is just worn enough so that a new chain will skip on it unless it is really really worn out. Thats why there is a tool called a chain checker which tells you if a chain is worn and you should change the chain when it has stretched more than  according to the tool. But carrying a tool just to check your chain is just too much so just change your chain every  to  km and your cassette should last  or  chains or more. This all depends on what kind of riding your are doing. A chain may last  to  km on dry paved roads or even more a bit less on dry dirt roads and maybe less than  km if you ride in mud water and sand every day.Thats why I dont think that carrying a spare chain is useful as a chain will last at least around  km before being too worn.Just carry some spare chain links usually when you install a new chain you need to remove a couple of them just keep them in case you chain snaps.,bicycletouring,cqskv4t,2,t5_2sdwm

4258772,0,t3_39qzws,There are still houses every mile or so.  You can knock on anyones door or stop at any gas station or restaurant and theyll let you stay.  Almost anyone would do it without question.  One of my earliest memories out there was winning a kite competition as a kid being amazed at how well it flew then there being a tornado warning and gathering with strangers in my grandparents basement.  They may even drive out to pick you up if someone saw you earlier in the day.  You can usually predict the weather just looking at the sky.  Listen to any radio station and theyll have updates.  You can also look up weather radar on your phone to plan your day.  If you notice a sudden temperature drop start looking for shelter.  If its a tornado watch or warning never use a highway underpass or tree for shelter.  These places are deadly with high winds and the debris that may strike you.  Instead go somewhere flat and hug the ground if you have no other alternative.  If for some reason you arent listening to the radio wall clouds or a green sky are a sign you should look for shelter at least for a thunderstorm.  Funnel clouds are a sign for predicting tornadoes.  Thats a rather dramatic picture.  If youre seeing that you should be inside half an hour ago.  Look for something a little more subtle like a cloudy sky and some faint rotation.  I remember once seeing two specks that looked like they were orbiting each other in the sky turning on the radio and five minutes later we were in a tornado warning.  I hope Im not making this sound too dangerous.  Its not.  Predictive technology tree trimming and better construction mean the only people who get injured in these storms are the ones going out to make videos of it.  I predict youll make it through without incident.  But get yourself a radio AMFM or weather and listen if it gets cold or the clouds roll in.  You should find yourself with time to get to whichever house you see on the horizon.  And if there isnt a house in the distance a set of power lines should lead you to one.  ,bicycletouring,cs5ok5c,13,t5_2sdwm

5104273,0,t1_cv15jcf,Yup. I wouldnt have asked this if I hadnt checked every mechanical possibility. The only reason I can find is that the frame is too flexy. Could be that the front end has enough stiffness but the rear triangle is made out of too thin tubes or its the other way round. Anyways the frame vibrates like when compared to my other bikes.

5148501,0,t3_3lhov9,I have built  Soma bikes and am now working on one for my gf. These are my general observations Soma is a good basic frame at a good price. There are better steel frames but the Saga is available for  including fork on eBay and that is a good price and a lot of frame for the money. Second you can build a bike for about the same as you can buy one if you are careful AND if you have a competent local bike shop mechanic who is willing to help you do some of the work and work with your project. You will need an ally. Three  touring gear seems pretty standard for built up bikes. The basic parts list seems to be a Sugino XD triple crank and IRD front derailleur a Deore XT rear derailleur and Rivendell Silver friction bar end shifters. Most touring bikes are  or  speed. If you check the parts options on Rivendell Harris Cyclery Bike Touring News Bens Cycles etc. you will see the same parts more or less. And you can check eBay for cheaper prices etc. Prices vary by about . Next wheels are your big expense. Harris has some decent machine made wheels and you can have hand built wheels for about . This is one area where I would spend money and get the hand built wheels. But get  spoke touring wheels with rims that accommodate  tires.Here is the deal. Pay a good bike mechanic to true the headset tube and install the headset and cut the steering tube. Second pay a good mechanic to true the bottom bracket and install the spindle cartridge and crank.  Now  you can do everything else yourself including brakes shifters cables etc. you will need a few hardware store tools and that is it. I did buy the Park Road Bike manual but I also learned a lot from reading bikewrench subreddit.So read a lot and I mean A LOT. You should have a precise idea about what parts you want before you start. I think Bike Touring News and Harris are both willing to talk to you about your project.  But its quite doable to put together your own bike with a little help from your friendly lbs for a good price. If you want to have a more detailed parts list let me know. But half the fun is looking at web sites and making your own list. ,bicycletouring,cv6l6ff,3,t5_2sdwm

I ate this for dinner every night for about  weeks and had a ton left over for my next hiking trip. I do recommend bringing some seasoning because the meals do end up being a bit bland alone but theyre super simple to cook and come with  different recipes so you arent eating the same thing every night. Yes this is a vegan option but you can always stop for beef jerky along the road if you want and I often bought packs of eggs and dehydrated hash browns along the way for breakfasts. Lunch was almost always just clif bars pop tarts other crap food and fruit when I could find it. Fck stopping to cook lunch.Edit Add a couple tablespoons of quinoa per meal is what I meant to say. Quinoa is a complete protein and cooks quickly in water.

But the one we had placed the shifting on the tail end of the handlebars it made going down hills over a  grade a more difficult to tackle with the speed. That said our  carried much less weight because the other two bikes on the tour were KHS Milano tandems so they were easier to handle at high speeds with all the extra weight. If youre going to use this bike for commuting I think I would pick a LHT. The  was not forgiving on any bumps in the road.

Im currently using this bag a sea to summit waterproof technical pack that you can cinch tight and throw over your two back panniers just like you would a duffle.  If youre into sticking with what you know Ortlieb has always been the tourers best friend and now makes an awesome waterproof mountaineering bag  The ortlieb has a more duffleshape than the seatosummit I suggested above and i can vouch for the fact that this thing is bombproof.  Ive used this not only for mountaineering and cycling but taken all the bags off the cycle and thrown them on a pack horse and he dragged it through rough scrub constantly and never managed to rip it.  The ortlieb pack can even carry skis!  Both of these bags support hydration bladders and have a frame Id characterize as soft but substantial.. you can sort of wad them up but they are sturdy enough to carry about kg comfortably.

7817834,0,t1_d3uruik,Sure some people love drop bars but since I come from more of a MTBcross country background Ive always found them clumsy and awkward and imprecise especially if you do any offroad riding cross country single tracks riding down dirt or gravel and all the unpaved places you go when touring.And by awkward I mean that the steering seems underleveraged and that you cant get as tight of a turn out of drop bars because the drops usually interfere with your top tub on very tight slow turns. Like trying to do a uturn in the middle of a singletack without getting off the bike.They also seem like the wrong design if youre generally riding in the up position. Flat bars with ergo countour grips or bar ends or looped trekking bars fulfill all of the needs for hand placement changes as well as good wide grip for hill climb shoveling.Also the ergo counter grips you can get for modern flat bars pretty much eliminate hand placement fatigue once you get them positioned just right for you.Holding on the bar ends is way way more comfortable than propping myself up on the boots and bar tape of drop bars as its nearly a neutrally balanced position when Im sitting correctly on my sitbones and most of my weight is balanced nicely on my feet and seat.,bicycletouring,d3usfbg,2,t5_2sdwm

If the scratch gets rusty take some WD and a paper towel and rub it lightly until the rust comes off then wipe it off good and put the lube on it like described above.  Honestly really the same approach youd use to protect a chain or a gun or anything else metal.Theres more effective ways like adding clear coat sealer but thats more work and honestly the oiling effort is probably overkill on its own.As far as repair if your bikes nice enough for you to care this much the paints probably powdercoated which means theres not much you can do.,bicycletouring,d73i2lu,3,t5_2sdwm

It saves GPX files with all the data you want recorded.The eTrex  accepts an SD card for the map files.

However a belt is far less likely to break.A chain also needs to be kept under tension this means either having a drailleur thingy or having to manually put the chain under tension when removing the rear wheel which is a huge pain. So either a chain involves more chance of something going wrong or makes changing a tube a hassle. A chain also picks up dirt and oil.

10091645,0,t1_dbmtlge,Yea a bit. You can see that Im using a very tall quill a Nitto Techmonic which has pretty short reach. This is to accomodate for the sizable drop in the bars and how far they extend forward. Took me a while to find the ideal stem configuration. But I love the bars. The bar end brake levers are so much better than road levers. I also played around with many different shifter configurations before discovering my love for down tube shifters. ,bicycletouring,dbmyhk9,1,t5_2sdwm
10111551,0,t1_dbpglco,Warning Never ever tie off anything to a cactus thats as tall or taller than you.If a cactus is taller than a human its probably a saguaro. Those things can weigh about a hundred pounds per linear foot if its had a good rain recently. A large tree sized saguaro can weigh dozens of tons.And they have a very shallow root system and like to fall over if you push on them. They are not trees but like large trees if they fall on you they can crush you into a fine gritty paste.If a wind or gust kicks up a tarp can put a very large pulling load on a saguaro and knock it right over.The limbs and lobes of large saguaro also like to drop and fall off without warning. Its part of how saguaro work and survive. Trees dont normally drop branches unless its windy but a saguaro will drop limbs whenever just to balance itself or for survival to get rid of a damaged limb.Also most cacti and saguaro are protected andor endangered. You can actually get in a lot of trouble for damaging a saguaro. If Im recalling correctly its actually a felony in AZ to harm poach move or damage saguaro. Poaching or destroying saguaro is actually a huge problem there. And developers would rather bulldoze them but theyre required by law to save them and transplant them elsewhere because they take forever to grow and theyre endangered.And tying a paracord line around a saguaro is a good way to cut it or scar it for life.,bicycletouring,dbpjmia,11,t5_2sdwm

I ended up disassembling the shifters to remove the indexing washer turning them into friction shifters. Ive been running them like that for a year now and they work great.WAAAAAAIT. The microshifts dont have a switch that lets you turn them into friction shifters?

10733466,0,t3_5tjllk,ELI regarding bicycling shoes the advantage is that they have attachment points on the bottom of the shoe that clip to the bike pedal tightly and this allows you to pull up with your rear leg in addition to the normal pedaling motion of just pushing down with the front leg which allows you to put much more power into the drivetrain.  Cycling shoes generally have a very stiff sole as well with allows for more effective power transfer. Take it from someone who wears a size  they do exist but they are extremely scarce.  Look for American  brands the European brands dont go up into the extra large sizes.  May the force be with you. ,bicycletouring,ddn2rri,-3,t5_2sdwm

10750475,0,t3_5tqzb8,Hi first as rHoonsoot said no need to be a long time cyclist. For long tours like this everything is in the mind. Good physical condition is a plus to start your trip but you will get fitter anyway... If you like what you do you can get anywhere you want. Be careful with highend bikes. When touring you have to choose parts that you can easily fix yourself and if you cannot chose a frame for which you can easily find spare parts. There is also a sort of consensus on steel for the frame material on expedition bikes as it is repairable as opposed to aluminum that you hardly weld twice or carbon that is way to rigid fragile and impossible to repair. To answer your last questions in order there are a lot of good sites and forum for basic info but the best advices I had is from meeting passionate people. I wanted to travel to discover the world and I decided I would start by PMing people on forums for IRL meeting and most of them where enchanted to have a drink and talk about their trips. I had most of my questions answered and had a really good time !Q For repairing nothing is hard but you will likely fail the first time you put grip on you handlebar or the first time you replace your groupset. Make sure it happens in your garage where you can see what tool you miss and improve your skills with a cup of tea and not somewhere like here because it will then be mentally challenging.Q I wish someone told me earlier how tiewraps would save my life in almost all situations. I didnt have them for my first trip and now I cant imagine going without. Make also sure you have a double of every critical parts that you cant repair like a skewer. If it breaks and you dont have a spare one youre good to call a taxi if any... Q I personally ride on a Genesis CroixdeFer But I went on trip on a very old peugeot for years. If you wish to go for long distances per day on road go for something like a Kona Sutra or a Surely LHT. I dont know much about offroad machine maybe someone will help you better...,bicycletouring,ddotuxl,2,t5_2sdwm

These mixed use paths are never selected by the routing software which prefers busy on road routes. There are cases where there are side streets that run parallel to busy roads that are designated cycle routes that are not selected because the streets are effectively nothrough roads connected by a series of small parks.Do mixed use paths have to be redesign aged tagged as cycleways to work?
