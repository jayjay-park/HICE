6157973,0,t1_cylr5sb,I agree that this would be a very useful feature. Sometimes Ive been registered for a session and I didnt know why it wasnt happening when the time came. One time I realized what was going on and so I decided to take over as leader but it was too late as by the time I sent the invites out everyone had bailed.It would be nice if someone could volunteer as the new leader via the web interface and that the fact that there is a new leader would be represented in the session. If there is no current leader it would be nice if that fact was displayed in bright red or what have you.,the100website,cyplj2e,3,t5_35vxz

8933084,0,t3_4zitg4,Since we have private matches in Destiny now it would be nice if the first one to sign up for each team would become its leader.On PS the max party size on the console app is  people and the max party size ingame is  people. It leaves us with a logistics problem since we will have to form two parties and join in orbit so every team member can communicate.This would make easier for everyone to know who would have the responsibility to send party invites on each side.Altough I guess this would be a bigger nuisance for people not in a group or opening a match for everyone on the site to join. It would be an awesome QoL update anyway.,the100website,d7lmi11,1,t5_35vxz
