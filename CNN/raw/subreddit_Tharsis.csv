6319653,0,t1_cz7lht2,I know one of the dev team personally so Ill bring it up next time I talk with him. However I am pretty sure a random event on the last turn is intended. No matter what your final score will be a bit luck dependent. This is a dice game after all. You just have to make sure you already have enough resources available and events already cleared that an unsolved event wont screw you over.,Tharsis,cz7z3v5,1,t5_39xxl

Im lucky enough to have plenty of experience with boardgames having played Pandemic Ghost Stories Elder Sign Space Cadets and King of TokyoNew York all of which bear nonzero similarity to Tharsis and combined with watching twothree youtubers give it a go I manage a gt winrate on normal.May I ask how many dice do your crew typically have? Id say  is the average over the entire game for me.  I find investing in crew dice to be worthwhile making Life Support and the Captain and Food and canabalism key parts of the tactics of the game. A typical turn should probably have the Captain help themselves and  other people. If you are unlucky the Captain only helps  other person. If you are lucky you get all  others with the Captain.,Tharsis,czj8cdw,1,t5_39xxl
6830075,0,t3_412ai0,Tried this game for the first time.  Absolutely hate the difficulty curve on it.Im sorry but if I cant beat a  minute game in the first  tries and there is no feeling of accomplishment or progression something is wrong.To me the game feels like slamming my head into a RNG wall and hoping that this time Ill get lucky and not break my skull.Came to the thread for advice helped a bit but not nearly enough.  Ive managed to make it  weeks in ONCE.  Thankfully I didnt buy the game yet.  Wont make that mistake.,Tharsis,d0qhmmf,1,t5_39xxl
