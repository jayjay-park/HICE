8165442,0,t1_d4y715q,Sadly just a bug I guess.I did a similar thing with the cooldowns when messing with my PCs clock I went forward  years and collected the Anima. I then set the clock back to the present time reopened the game and all of my cooldowns had around  years on them so I just restarted.,RSIdleAdv,d4y89nm,3,t5_3cljf
