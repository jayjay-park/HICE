299820,0,t3_1xjb1q,Ion weapons differentiate by charge time and amount of ion damage.   Ion Blast I charges at a medium speed and does  ion damage.   Ion Blast II charges at a fast speed and does  ion damage.   Heavy Ion charges at a slow speed and does  ion damage.   Ion Bombs charge at a slow speed and do  ion damage.  Duration depends on damage.  Off the top of my head  ion damage locks out a system for  or  seconds.  I dont remember the actual number.  Ion damage is cumulative.  If you deal additional ion damage to an ioned system then the damage will stack and additional time will be added to the lockout.  For example you have an Ion Blast II and are fighting a ship with  shield bubbles i.e.  power in shields.  You land a hit to their shield dealing  ion damage and locking them out for  seconds.  Now they have  power in shields so they are reduced to just  shield bubble.  Then you land another hit.  The previous lockout had  seconds remaining so another  seconds is added to the lockout taking it to  and they take another ion damage reducing them to  power in shields.  A third hit refreshes the lockout taking it from  to  taking the ion damage to  thus fully dropping their shields.Ion weapons are most powerful when you can get them to stack.  That means you can add more ion damage before the duration ends allowing you to completely ionize systems down to nothing.  Two Ion Blast Is will let you stack ion damage.  An Ion Blast I and a Heavy Ion will stack.  A Heavy Ion can stack on its own if you have an automated reloader.  Ion Blast IIs and Ion Bombs can stack with themselves.,ftlgame,cfbubro,21,t5_2tnu1

589131,0,t1_cg6xwrt,If I can offer some advice based on your stats  Your most ships defeated is  in  run while your most beacons explored is . While this probably means youre not running away from fights it does give me the impression youre not always spending maximum time in each sector. I would suggest most runs getting to the final boss should give you between  beacons or greater meaning at least an extra few hundred money to spend which can be very useful. This would increase your total scrap collected. To achieve this many beacons you should be reaching the exit beacon just before the red zone reaches it ie on the next jump they would overtake the exit or even after they have reached it but not by more than  jump because its just a waste of fuel and possibly other resources at that stage. As youve worked out boarding is a massive strategy so use it for a lot of other ships.Youve experienced your first kill so congratulations no go do it some more and have fun experimenting.,ftlgame,cg78l3y,4,t5_2tnu1
600877,0,t1_cg8fp6q,I think the passive heal you get from each jump may be enough for your homebody crew in most cases stray hits through the shields boarders directly into the cockpit etc. Esp. if its worth upgrading to the jump level for boarding or blue options.

626278,0,t1_cgbfb1n,You can generate one hologram at empty beacons for  scrap as long as you keep the AI Avatar Generator aug that performs the feat. When you are full on crew it actually becomes a temptation to sell the Avatar Generator cause it is worth quite a bit. But this will deprave you of your ability to generate new AI crew.Overall Id say the AI ship play style is not more or less difficult than a regular play through. But it creates a different experience with new stuff to look out for while you can disregard other stuff.Here are some guidelines for playing an AI ship Keep track of your crews health duhIts pretty essential to keep the AIs at full health to make sure that they do not get killed by stray shots. Especially relevant if your enemy has even low tier light lasers. Learn what threatens your crewAIs can be oneshot killed by certain weapons mainly strong missiles artillery lasers and high tier light lasers. If you see opponents with these weapons consider making disarming them a priority. Or avoid the fight if you have the possibility and do not want to take the risk. Dodge!With your crew I mean. Some of the AI killer weapons have predictable targeting. With some micromanagement you can anticipate where strong missiles will hit and can move your AI crew out of the way. Dont underestimate boardersAIs will still have to fight it out sometimes if you dont have doors or want to prevent a system from getting damaged. You might also get boarded by boarding drones and enemy AIs or... Lanius!? against which you will loose your main advantage suffocation damage. Swap your defence force quickly and send them to the medbay or swarm the enemies to gain the upper hand. Realize that AIs are expendableAs long as you keep your Avatar Generator lost crew can be replaced relative easily. This offers some interesting possibilities regarding certain events specially in the early game when your AIs have not gained much experience yet. Loosing your experienced elite AI pilot is still bad of course. Realize that AIs can be boarders tooAuto ships and stations have no way to defend themselves against AIs running amok inside them. The auto troopship is an exception here as it often carries AP drones.Note that the transition to this playstyle can also be made with other ships than the Vortext. The AI Avatar Generator can be found or bought in stores sometimes. A dual strategy where you vent only parts of the ship and populate it with AIs is also possible. This might come in handy even more with AE cause AI Avatar work well together with the Lanius.,ftlgame,cgbgiyz,2,t5_2tnu1

Extra shields are nice but I cannot count the times that I have bought another shield layer and then had a chance to buy a REALLY good weapon. Cloaking and hacking are amazingly helpful in the final fight but make sure to save your cloak until the enemy fires. Weapon preigniters are good. Buy them. Flak I is also really good. Low cooldown  tons of damage  fun times. Nebula sectors are not worth it IMHO. Unless you are doing an unlock run and need to go through one it is best to avoid them. Unless you cant afford the damage always protect outposts always attack mercenaries never pay tolls and never draw straws or buy slavesunless you need that specific race for an unlock run.,ftlgame,cgr1un9,3,t5_2tnu1

787560,0,t1_cgtkrj1,Theres a specific tactic to it which means cutting out most risk. Upgrade to max stealth as the highest priority and then take advantage of how it freezes weapon cooldowns. With  seconds cloak time the enemy will simply not have time to charge their weapons before the glaive beam fires. If the glaive beam either kills them or takes out their weapons then they have zero chance of hurting you. This makes the Stealth B far more reliable than any other ship.Attack drones can spoil this but with good timing you can minimise their hits and theres very little chance of them hitting your weapons. Once you get shields theyre no longer an issue. Other things like hacking can also alleviate their threat.Stealth B is considered gimmicky and unreliable because most people dont know how to play it right P Like most ships in the game it has had some very clever thought put into its design which requires a change of tactics to fully appreciate.,ftlgame,cgtsslx,1,t5_2tnu1

Bombs work great at keeping the missiles down without killing the ship and damaging enemies so theyll run to the medbay to get drained to death. Its hardest on a gunship you need to keep damaging the missiles to keep them down and killing the repair people when they get hurt but they only run to the medbay once theyre finished repairing so theres delicate timing involved.If I have crazy DPS I might just try to blitz down the ship in which case I hack piloting to drop the evasion to  and prevent it being manned any other time.  projectiles are enough to cripple the missile launcher on the first volley if you use the hacking to drop their dodge.If Im boarding Ill either hack hacking or missile launcher. Hacking if they hit something vital missile launcher if they dont. Having a couple of doors on their ship is amazing for boarding and you can depower hacking to let enemies through and then trap them.

There are a lot of different defensive strategies for the flagship too many to list but here are a few.Cloak through the power surges with level  cloak so that cloak will be recharged for the next surge.A defence drone  will always take out one of the missiles if you have decent evasion usually only one of the other missiles will hit.Goldlevel shield operator means nothing. You want gold level pilot and engines and level  engines for  total evade. With that and  shields you can tank almost all the shield damage during every phase.Prioritise taking out the missiles with a volley or a bomb or teleporters or missiles or whatever hack them if you have to just get them down.Kill all the enemies in phase  except the laser guy so that no one can repair in phase  and no one boards you in phase .

If your volleys only do marginal damage above their shields itll help out a lot. Thats really a marginal case though.Mind control really shines in exploiting the enemy ships issues. Doing a few more points of damage in a volley is kind of meh. Mind controlling a crew member trying to put out a fire on a burning weapon or shield system is ridiculous. As is using it to interrupt repairs on broken O systems.When you use MC to make volleys land you dont have it to keep their stuff brokenon fireventing into space longer.Basically its the snowball theory of problems. Having a crew mind controlled is one problem. Each damaged system is a problem. Each tile that is on fire is a problem. Each suffocation tile is a problem. Having many problems is harder than the sum of the individual subproblems since they interfere with each other. If you shields are down but you have two engies repairing it you can deal with that  but you dont have those engies for dealing with other problems.

1076051,0,t3_26f1qf,Miscellaneous tips You have couple of system slots free.  Cloaking hacking a teleporter or even mind control would greatly increase your survivability and chances of success in the future. Im assuming the mantis repairing your doors is your engineer.  Manned engines are incredibly important because they additively increase your dodge chance.  Moreover you shouldnt be repairing things with a mantis anyway especially if you have an engi manning the muchlessimportant shields system. Level  piloting is generally unnecessary unless you have scrap to burn.  Level  sensors can be a good investment because they let you see the enemy ship without being manned useful for boardingcrewkilling and let you see enemy weapon charge when manned useful for timing shots and dodging projectiles with cloak.Those are the major points I can see.

Relying on only one system is a good way to find yourself SOL in unexpected situations. Thats what makes Lanius B so broken its amazing at boarding without sacrificing weapons or defenses.Ill freely admit that hacking is definitely up there in terms of usefulness but personally I find the constant drain of drone parts to be a liability. Hackings versatility allows it to do things that mind control simply cant but it can also leave you stuck in the middle of a sector with a dry subsystem.

As you progress you consolidate and assume a more risk averse position.I find that ethos works well in FTL. After all youre investing to build a ship that will beat the boss. You tkae risks early on with crew with fights with events and later on you play more conservatively.The only thing I lost on this run was  minutes and a small amount of pride. I gained a bit of experience shit that event CAN kill crew! and a good laugh. So it all evens out.,ftlgame,cj3kn9k,4,t5_2tnu1

1606268,0,t1_cjhi9sd,Nice...thanks for the suggestions. I love the redshirt idea!Ill look at integrating as many of these as I can. Currently the layout is like this I added drones to the shuttlebay area because I hope to make a custom drone that looks like a Class F shuttle. For the weapons I will base the values of the Phaser on the Charge Laser and will create a Torpedo Launcher as well. We see eyetoeye on the  man teleporter.Regarding the Augments I have chosen the ones I did because the Enterprise should have warp drive Adv FTL Navigation Long Ranged Scanners but I will consider the third slot as one of the other ones. Ill play through both layouts and see which one is more fun.I know I have some wasted space on the pilot station but I hope to use custom artwork for the stations and creating a minibridge seems difficult if its smaller than x.I think Ill start off with something similar to your suggestion and see how fun it is to play through.

1711875,0,t3_2e0pq7,When I play with Engi A I usually want a weapon quickly to avoid relying too much on drones. Heavy Laser I is really great early with Ion Blast II it dont cost much to power and once the shield are down it deals a decent amount of damage. And its a fairly common weapon.Beam are probably your best choice later the IB will take care of the ship and the beam cant miss.Other ion weapons are also great it helps keeping the shield down against stealth or heavy engine ennemy ship. And if you can tank the ennemy ship you can use both ion to disable oxygen and suffocate your ennemy its quite long.Autobuy drone recovery arm.Consider taking Hacking or Mind control to reduce ennemy dodging. It will ease the ion stacking.Something like  IB  IB  Pike beam  Hull beam can deal quite a good amount of damage.

1786910,0,t1_ck4ccqj,The way to use the stun bomb for boarding is to draw as many enemies as you can into either the weapon or shield room those are the two highest priority rooms on a ship fire the stun bomb and evacuate all but one of your boarders from the room. Right before the bomb hits as it is appearing unless the last guy in the room is a rock get your last guy out of there. Because enemies stay in a room until all threats boarders and boarding drones are out of the room they wont have enough time to escape the room before the bomb hits.You dont have to go for the weapons or engines room but those rooms tend to hold four people and you also get a convenient  second ion on whichever system you use. If youre good enough and youre fighting a ship with less than  people you can take down an entire ship using only one stun bomb. Ive actually gotten it to the point that in one of my mantis C runs I managed to kill the flagship with only bombs stun small and breach  and no crew had to be cloned as a result of combat. Trust me theres nothing more satisfying in this game than stunning  enemies on the flagship in the shield room and then immediately doing over  damage with bombs.To take down the flagship with a stun bomb you have to open up the door just below shields if thats where you want to board by sending your crew anywhere in the lower half of the flagship. Once its open send your guys to the shield room and do the normal stun bomb  person stun. If you get the first two people out of the room early enough then the laser guy and the missile guy if youre on hard may also be in the room when the stun bomb goes off.In my opinion Its one of the best weapons if used correctly.,ftlgame,ck4e5a3,3,t5_2tnu1

The Breach IIs guaranteed hole punching effect also kind of breaks it in conjunction with its completely acceptable charge time.

2557367,0,t3_2p165d,Enemies with missile weapons are an annoying aspect of FTL and can often stop a run.  Fortunately there are some things you can do against them. Invest in your engines.  A lot of newer players overlook engine upgrades but evasion is critical to success in FTL.  Evasion provides good defense against large laser volleys in addition to bombs and missiles.. Buy cloaking.  When a missile comes cloak to dodge it.. Drone control.  A Defense I drone will shoot down incoming missiles hacking modules and boarding drones.  A Defense II will shoot at all incoming projectiles.  Note however that Defense II has a habit of shooting down lasers that would otherwise bounce harmlessly against your shield and letting through a missile.. Take out their weapons system to prevent them from firing missiles.  In many of my encounters I will focus on weapons before anything else.That covers the basics.  There are more advanced strategies due to its long cooldown the breach missile can be fully countered with cloaking.  A combination of hacking and cloaking can ensure that enemy volleys never connect.,ftlgame,cmsdw0x,14,t5_2tnu1

2589218,0,t3_2pgxgc,well the run was pretty awkward as you can see I lost a ton of crew members due to mistakes while boarding... but I managed to get to the flagship with an almost fully upgraded ship thats why I tried the Gila Monster... boarding gets you more scrap and I was worried I wouldnt have enough. phase  took zero damage. phase  I was going to send a boarding party to counteract those missiles but that boarding drone hit the cloak. I had to counter it or Id eat the power surges. so I sent my crew to deal with it. but being engis... well it didnt fare well not that they died but they couldnt beat it fast enoughmeanwhile the missiles where hitting me the surges were hitting me my pilot died to a missile after trying to fight the boarding drone I sent him back to piloting since the surge was near and then a missile hit the cockpit and he was dead and finally I got defeated. but overall Im pretty happy with this run. the start was quite rough since I made a ton of mistakes with my boarders and also hadnt enough scrap nor enough firepower. but by sector  I was going quite well. and in the end I lost to a mistake and a bit of bad luck my pilot didnt need to die.... not to true lack of knowhow. also a thought medium is not actually that harder. well the start is harder you have way less scrap and the enemies are more powerful. but I even got to almost fully upgrade the ship and the final weapon loadout was powerful enough to deal with the flagship so... Ill definitely try again with some other ships ... Im not that used to boarding... ,ftlgame,cmwjq8b,2,t5_2tnu1

2648358,0,t3_2q9220,The worst one that I still remember to this day was when I was using the Stealth Cruiser type A for a change. Id normally fail within the first two or three sectors. But I managed to survive mainly because of the luck of getting a full crew complement decent weaponry and full shields engines and level  cloaking no drone system.Im in sector  happily on my way to the last stand. Three beacons from the last one I run into an Auto Assault with hacking a Halberd beam and a missile launcher plus level  shields. I prepare to scratch up one more. The ship launches the hacking drone and it hits the oxygen room neighbouring the piloting room. I thought this is okay Im not going to die from oxygen starvation. Before I realize it a missile  damage hits the piloting room and causes a fire. The Engi in there started combating the fire and my evasion went down slightly. This isnt good. I try to get another Engi and a Human into there to help but because of the hacking it takes time to break down the doors. I send my two mantis to attack the doors as well. At this point a missile hits the piloting room again and creates yet more fire which also takes the subsystem offline and kills the Engi pilot. All the while the fire spreads to the oxygen room that the two Mantis and Engi have just broken into I sent the Human back to his station. As the Mantis try to break down the piloting room doors the hacking is still ongoing and shuts all the doors and at that instant another missile hits the oxygen room taking it offline creating a hull breach and pretty much killing all three within a matter of seconds.After a few more missiles a hit from the halberd beam and a death of another crew member trying to get to the piloting system I manage to destroy the Auto Assault. I get the scrap that I wanted but after losing  hull points and ths of my crew and no store in sight to repair I couldnt see me winning against the Flagship. I got to the first stage but I blew up before I did more than two hull points worth of damage.I never really tried with the Stealth Cruiser Type A again. I believe the phrase GetRekt was applicable to that run. The RNG gods hated me that day ,ftlgame,cn49szy,8,t5_2tnu1

2703084,0,t1_cnb8cs8,That will help a lot. Level  engines are a mustget. Cloaking would have also been very helpful you only need level  to dodge the flagships most damaging attacks. Aside from that upgraded doors can be a lifesaver in boarding situations since they allow you to asphyxiate most boarders with ease especially with someone manning the door system. That also means you wouldnt need the Antipersonnel drone I dont think Ive ever actually used one! and could have saved the scrap and drone parts.I would also recommend level  medbay and level  oxygen at least by the middleend of your run. You rarely need any more than that and less is dangerous because it allows your systems to be broken from any small hit.,ftlgame,cnbbwnt,3,t5_2tnu1
2709264,0,t1_cnbpvuy,Haha indeed I won! The missiles and lasers either missed were absorbed by shields or were shot down by trusty Defence Drone II the hacking drones never got to my systems and in later stages their boarders were easily dealt with.As youve suggested my weapons tore through their defences and left the prized Flagship a husk in no time.The Nisos is damn good and this ship felt truly indomitable to fly.,ftlgame,cnc16gt,2,t5_2tnu1
2714004,0,t3_2r4sba,uhh... you dont need all the systems maxed oxygen medbay cloak but shields  are useful . IIRC on your last run somebody suggested you that shields L were not a priority  against decent engines and L systems. but they are more useful than L systems for sure  well IMHO anyway. maybe even against maxed engines since past L you only get a  evasion per upgrade instead of the  you get in lower levels. also for your next run you should try to get a bit more firepower. another laser or beam instead of that firebomb would have been nice. well I know the combat drone kinda makes up for it but... say on phase  it is useless. so you can only do  damage every nine seconds plus the fire bomb which is a nice to haveand last tip you could easily had done with  less power to drones. just power up the two defense ones when the missiles come bay  any other time they dont need to be up so you can use that power slots for the combat one. also its the first time I have seen two def drones. I certainly see how this can be useful but... you already have the cloak. you dont even need the def drones.  though they are also a nice to have especially against phase   so  power slots to drones should have been enough and then just switch from combat to def as needed. anyway congrats on your first win. now youre on the true path to victory which should be something like winning with every ship on hard... IDK Im still on easy lol. ,ftlgame,cnckl2o,6,t5_2tnu1

Its definitely better than  BL thats for sure.gt IMO should have dropped the Burst Laser III and spending the scrap on backup battery different weapons and augments.I never bother with battery unless I start with it i.e. the Cerenkov or I want to get it for a challenge run.

The Zoltan A is a powerful ship when the halberd is supported by flak or laser and the small bomb is a lovely addition to max out that eight power. With weapons like that who needs additional systems?  Zoltan A is a great choice for a first Hard win.

This is important doors medbays mantis antipersonnel drone shield drone and others can make things very dangerous. Change places or dance your crew  going out and back into a room in a different order so they dont die. Dont just use boarding  weapons are important for support.More specifically for Fed C  start of the game is pretty nasty since you cant take out weapons. Its best to send over every member of your crew to just kill them as soon as you can.

In fact I actually thought the survivor was an engi until I read the options. I have great difficulty in believing the devs would make such a rookie error in an event text.Edit  Regarding the second event  scrap is too much to lose in the vanilla game even or normal. I again have great difficulty believing the devs would make such an unbalanced event considering theres no other event in the game that does this. The only one that comes close is the give  scrap to purchase an unknown weapon and even if you lose the scrap and get no weapon you have the option to fight the ship regardless of your setup and not reliant on having a blue option.,ftlgame,cqhbxcq,5,t5_2tnu1

Perhaps the ship could add a crew member too. To balance this perhaps cut the drone initial power to lvl  and give a Combat I drone instead of II. Im imagining a slugging match filled first sector or two before getting cloaking or shields where you have enough firepower to do damage to the enemy ship and can win most battles but a fair amount of micro is involved to deal with damage that you initially cannot block. Additionally it would be interesting if in return for the third drone slot the ship could be prevented from ever getting a shield subsystem.

Unless youre willing to cheese the game with the HPE the current loadout of weapons is only passable in terms of effectiveness your damage is okay because of the Heavy Laser but your ShieldBreaking capacity is going to become sketchy near the end of the run.As for Vulcan  focus all your weapons fire on the enemy Engines to hold them in place while the Vulcan mercilessly crushes them into a fine paste. Having your Basic and Heavy Lasers as additional shieldpunching power will help it nicely in doing this and if you need to you can use Mind Control or an Engines hack to disrupt their evasion more than long enough to catch them in a stranglehold.,ftlgame,cshj63i,2,t5_2tnu1

Hacking is a great system but I think its best uses are to drop shields unnecessary with the artillery beam or to hack the enemy medbay for boarding purposes.Cloaking  defense drone will let you avoid most damage giving the beam time to charge up. Once you get rolling youll be unstoppable. Its all about reaching the late midgame with FTL.For a long time I couldnt do anything with the Swallow Kestrel C. Its not a horrible ship not amazing either but I kept losing over and over with it. Just had to get over the hump.As for depowering artillery its entirely dependent on your weapons.

The appearance is just a yellowishwhite blob which could represent a projectile of metal that is glowing whitehot from being accelerated to near the speed of light. ASBs can be fired from planets or from large cruisers but dont appear on any small ships  makes me think that in the FTL universe these railguns are too large to fit on small ships.Then again in writing this I realized that shields protect against flak as well as lasers and beams despite it being a physical object... so now I dont know what to believe.,ftlgame,csxqayf,4,t5_2tnu1

One way to make this ship much better would be to replace the other system repair drone with an offensive drone of some sort. Even having Ion Blast I and  starting weapon power instead of Heavy Ion and  would be better. But its obviously a challenge ship maybe the clearest example of that in FTL as it really doesnt have any significant upsides.,ftlgame,ct6cyzi,2,t5_2tnu1

It seems like two hit the shields two missed and three had the damage negated the the Rock Plating.Firstly the ones that hit shields each one has a  chance of hitting so both would be  of that.Now the we need  of the remaining  shots to miss. Considering the  chance of evade we have  chance of achieving that for a single given possibility. Considering  out of  possibilities match up  we have  chance of getting that result I may have fucked this part up Im not entirely sure if this makes sense. Could be  or  as well not sure.Finally we have the  shots that hit the hull. The chances of each one of them having their damaged blocked by the Rock Plating is . To have all of them blocked the chance is  which gives us .Multiplying everything the odds would be approximately a chance of  or once in  times. Notes My calculations may be completely wrong. Thats just what makes a bit of sense in my head.Also I took in consideration the fact that both the first shots hit the shields before missing because the MISS indicators are on top of the systems instead of the shields indicating that they were already down before the misses.Also I just realized I spent more than  minutes doing this....

6425684,0,t1_czgy0kz,gt I dont think theres any chance of us getting to a remotely mutually agreeable compromise at this point ...Probably not but its been interesting anyway.gt How easily you completely disregard it to say But you get LRS and good weapons is becoming kind of silly at this point.Meanwhile I find your fixation on defensive systems to be hilarious. The large part of why SimoH is underrated is that people bring their biases from other ships into the mix. The best defense isnt Cloaking or Shields its offense a dead or disabled ship poses no threat to you whatsoever.Looking at the SimoHs drone system purely from the standpoint of its ability to allow you to turtle relative to ShieldsCloaking completely misses  the point of the ship and  the goal of the game.gt It really really isnt anything special to be able to kill ships.Listen the fact that the SimoH can slice through the first two sectors of the game without any bad matchups is devastating to your case that its unreliable. Pointing that out means highlighting that there are a double handful of other ships that can NOT just cruise through the earlygame.I am sorry if its annoying to have this constantly pointed out to you. However Im not the one who chose to die on the almost every other ship is more reliable hill. Feel free to walk it back at your optionconvenience.gt Which ship gets a scrap system instead of a  one?Is it really accurate to call it a scrap system? You cannot buy a threeslot Drone Control on any ship. SimoH is the only nonEngi ship that even has one of these things in the first place and it enables all sorts of combinations that are simply impossible on other ships.gt Lets put it this way how much would you spend on LRS in a store?Depending on the sector where it showed up what the upcoming map looked like nebulas? and the ship I was driving Id throw down as much as  scrap for LRS. Its not worth less than an extra jump per sector which is what the Distraction Buoys are getting you at  and they can be a pretty good buy.gt Im starting to get the feeling you should reexamine just how capable other ships can be all by themselvesWell I have the feeling that you should rexamine just how useful it is to be able to disable enemy ships before they can even have a chance to damage you.gt Handling enemy drones is no worse than Stealth C and its hitmiss anti drone ... It takes a similar amount of scrap to upgrade cloak as it does for the drone bar that let you use both drones ...Stealth A has it worse sorry. Cloaking costs half again as much as Drone Control to upgrade and an enemy Beam drone is going to get a lick at you until then no matter what. SimoH has to deal with the drone starting in a blind spot but the Antidrone will otherwise stun the drone pretty reliably. Fight gets worse for Stealth A in the event that it goes longer than expected since Cloaking is down and you have no way to get a shield bubble up.Again calling crew the only advantage that SimoH has over its cousin is just incorrect. Weapons are better offensive options are better. Drone Control system is even more powerful. These are just objectively true things.gt Which still puts them at early risk. Not a major one but dont tell me it has no issues whatsoever when it can clearly happen.Barely even a minor risk. SimoH can take a hit to either Weapons or Drone Control from a combat drone in S without being disabled. Charge L. and AntiDrone still function with a damaged System. The upgrades are cheap insurance. Its not like say a hit to Weapons on the Stealth B.gt I agree but not to the point where they would make a major difference.One wonders what would be a major difference here. The crew makes surfing nebulas even more lucrative than normal is better for a boarding option and combines with the Clone Bay to make it easier to get more crew. More options gt fewer. Blue options are the tip of the iceberg.gt At  scrap per unit they are one of the absolute worst thing you could have to buy.You show me someone who has never bought a drone part and Ill show you a skinflint who has lost runs that they could have salvaged. Theres no efficiency victory condition in this game  conserving scrap is not something that gives you a W its something that makes it more likely. You know what else makes victory more likely? Smoothing out the variance on getting RNGscrewed out of missiles or drone parts.gt And you misunderstand what I mean by pairing badly.Id say that I understand you perfectly and that the problem is with your use of words like it is for reliable.gt The fact that youre running out of drone parts and have to buy them is proof in itself.Id say that this is proof youre not reading what Im writing since I didnt say I run out of drone parts and have to buy them. Its important to be able to tell the difference between what someone says and what you merely infer.gt My whole point is that any normal ship can do either just as well or better.And my rebuttal is that the SimoH coasts through the first two sectors of every playthrough without needing to find so much as a single store chewing apart everything. Its a decidedly middletier ship you just need to know how to drive it.gt Again with these?Listen youre the one who conflates nice to have and need. I gave you examples of things that demonstrate actual need not just a desire for a warm fuzzy feeling.gt You dont always have to dive. ... Consider it and do what gets you the most profit and even if you do take some damage it is often irrelevant in comparison to how much more you make.You are welcome to dive at your leisure. You are not welcome to advocate a risky gamble on a ship that youre trying to show is more reliable than the SimoH for reasons which ought to be fairly selfevident.gt Well I guess if its not enough for you Im not going to convince you.You are correct there. If I point out the manifest problems that Slug B has with time pressure and your response doesnt reduce those issues to the point of being more reliable than SimoH then I dont know how you thought youd be changing my mind.gt Tetragon isnt stalling for anything. It can use the hacking and dual lasers alone on many early ships without taking damage.Good grief. This is what you said in response to my claim that they both use drones to cover their weaknesses. Hacking uses drone parts! Were you under the impression that I was only talking about the Beam drone? Tetragons offense is clearly buttressed by parts. Same can be said about SimoHs defense.gt The Swallow is crappy. The only thing keeping it out of my bottom tier is the occasional crew kill and the fact that its weapons upgrade very wellIts great that you agree that the Swallow is bad. Its confusing that you dont see how the SimoH is more reliable.gt I dont see why its so hard to understand ...Please.

Ion Blast  which has an  second cooldown and only takes one power.So if youre needing to drop a layer of shields heavy ion makes you wait  seconds to do it Ion Blast  makes you wait  seconds for half the power.The only way heavy ion has any benefit over ion blast is if youre using it to drop systems other than shields which means that shields are already down in which case you might as well just damage the systems directly with lasers or beams.,ftlgame,d0prvcw,3,t5_2tnu1

6900653,0,t3_4a8osa,I usually hack shields especially when Im using beams.  You can take down shields with hacking use the beam to disable piloting or engines and distribute the rest of your volley wherever you need to.  Bonus points for using mind control on the pilot to further reduce evasion.  Or you could path your beam to hit enough rooms that the pilot leaves piloting cutting evasion for the rest of your volley.I will hack engines or piloting when Im using lots of projectile weaponry and where the expected value of damage from hacking shields is lower than that of hacking engines.  This will happen with say quad flak I.I will hack weapons if I think the enemys loadout is really dangerous then damage weapons and use the hacking to slow repairs or let any fire in weapons grow and spread.  Hacking weapons while cloaking volleys when hacking is on cooldown is a great defensive combination.Otherwise Ill usually hack oxygen for crew culls if I believe I can pull it off without taking too much hull damage.  I rarely hack medbay or clonebay because there are usually better ways to deal with either.

8459913,0,t3_4v87y0,As others have said save up your scrap until you hit a shop. If it has something cool in it buy it if it doesnt upgrade your stuff. Also prioritize your system upgrades correctly. Sensors are only useful if you need to see enemy crew say you have a mindcontrol or anti crew weapons or want to do boarding. And with boarding its mostly for convenience. Doors arent needed until boarding start getting prevalent. Like if you are about to enter a mantis controlled sector or its starting getting into the midgamesector five or so.In both these cases so long as you have some crew when needed you can just man the systems to raise their lvl by . I usually dont upgrade the pilot subsystem until Im at sector . Though I guess it makes it slightly more resilient with the occasional unlucky hit.

8914102,0,t1_d7j3yct,I didnt mean flak just board them until the weapons are down and you can break the medbay distracting them with the shield room is vital here. Some ships can be strong enough this becomes too hard but you can usually do it. Still have it at the bottom though. Early damage taken is terrible and the ship doesnt really have anything going for it except the teleporter. Oh how I wish we could have flak arty without boarding.gt Sector  having one of cloaksuper shieldhacking can be a big problem if it hacks the wrong stuff boarding events boarding  Zoltan shields theres a lot of stuff in sector  that tends to screw you if you cant shoot out weapons fast or have more longterm countermeasures. Almost every other ship can find an answer to those by then for significantly less scrap.Like I said sorry for repeating myself while its kinda true the way cloak can deal with them shouldnt be underestimated. Within the first two sectors level  cloak doesnt even need the shields against most encounters. Once you get into sector  you see more equipment on enemy ships yes but if you can now prevent most damage with the shields cloak becomes even better at stalling and avoiding specific damage because it doesnt need to do as much of a job. You can risk more too since the shields will still protect you from majority  of damage.  I wouldnt say geting there with only shields is optimal and you may take a little damage around that time but I think youre fairly safe from something screwing you as you put it.  So you can slowly but surely work your way to hacking or otherwise and once you obtain it thats really all thats necessary for a long while. You just need to survive that long.I have stealth B on the bottom too that bottom is stealth B engi B fed C and rock A for the record. What bothers me more is the way very early game can completely break your ship until you can pick up the cloak upgrade. Cant possibly justify a ship that can happen to being in a tier any higher. I guess both these things are problems stealth B really is pretty bad.,ftlgame,d7jceru,1,t5_2tnu1

10175555,0,t3_5lpfem,Definitely use your bombs more.If enemy weapons are scary its usually a good idea to board into the shields room or the engines room to pull enemy crew away from their stations and give your subsequent bomb a better chance to land in the weapons room. The enemy crew should then be too busy fighting your crew to actually get the weapons repaired.You can then either follow up with another bomb to the medbayclonebay or board with your extra Mantis and Engi and overwhelm the enemy crew. The enemy prioritizes protecting the shields room above the medbay so you can keep them busy in the shields room while other boarders break the medbay without using a bomb.Eventually youll want to get a replacement pilot so you can have your third Mantis on permanent boarding duty and some better weapons but the ship starts out with everything it needs to beat ships in sectors  through .

For the longest time I managed to reach the last sector but never beat the flagship so thinking this way helped me stay motivated. I also feel like in a lot of ways the flagship is different from the rest of the game play through with a ship thats doing great for the whole game but doesnt stand a chance against flagship like a ship that  relies on crew kills for example and its disappointing. Like beating a level reach sector  or beat the level with all the secretsbonuses.

11326518,0,t3_61nh2d,What ships do you usually play? Some have better venting capabilities than others. Also opening multiple airlocks speeds up the venting speed of connected rooms.Temporarily manning the doors and sending crew to delay the boarders while the rooms are vented is usually enough. In some cases you can even make one of your crewmembers to pop in and out of a room with boarders in it causing them to run back and forth between breaking the door and attacking the crewmember. Doing that in a vented room saps their health quickly. The spots the fighters occupy are also important. Especially if youre dealing with Mantis or Rockmen you can reorder the people inside a room by pausing the game telling all combatants to leave the room then onebyone telling them to return in a specific order before unpausing. This lets you rotate less damaged crewmebers to take the hits. Likewise micromanaging people carefully to rotate damaged fighters into the medbay will generally win the fight for you in the long run. Dont forget to manage your weapons while doing that.Sometimes you also have to just vent everything but a few rooms and force the boarders from critical rooms even if that means leaving systems unmanned.,ftlgame,dffublc,2,t5_2tnu1

11699011,0,t1_dgm25bp,oxygen drain boarding is pretty cool. my favorite thing to do with them happens if the enemy has level  doors. breaking down enemy doors leaves them open and therefore also open up oxygen for the Lanius to absorb. the more doors you break down the less total oxygen there is making enemies flee and letting the Lanius break down whatever systems in that area without interference.gt meanwhile your two Lanii ...Ive always thought of it as Lanius or Laniuses but that might actually be the right plural. Lanius takes its name from the latin word for butcher uh... lanius whose plural is laniigt If I were made of clunky metal that scraped against itself Id go slow too!I dont think Ive ever thought of the Lanius as clunky metal. if they gt can melt and shape metal like its freaking putty or somethingthen Id think theyd be more of a gooey metal type being that can solidify and evidently liquefy at will. maybe the reason for their slow movement is that holding all that metal in place isnt all that easy. maybe to take their station they have to integrate themselves into the floor panels or something. I also had the thought of a similarity to the young Rockmen in this post that the Lanius are a similar type of ooze or something and in their early stages of life tie in with specific metals.or not at all maybe the Lanius are more integrated with the metal than they look. maybe in every inch of metal the Lanius occupy some strand of them is in there like the nerve endings of our body but somehow they can put more nerves into what appears to be a lifeless heap of metal integrating themselves with it? maybe they do something like that when they repair maybe that explains the noises.I have to say just thinking about the possibilities are endless really. kind of why I like scifi so much and its gotta be part of why you do those stories the space for creativity is there. the relatively vague nature of FTLs universe lends itself to these endless possibilities for lore and its amazing that the builtin lore is just enough to get this going but not too detailed so as to limit it.,ftlgame,dgm3nx1,17,t5_2tnu1

11722870,0,t3_679lmh,Where exactly do you come off with this I mean if I get the zoltan shield from the mission great if I get him well that is a cell of power and fully trained crew member. Either way it is a win and as long as I have constructed my ship well I dont rely off the Zoltan shield. Really in this game there is no guaranteesso any benefit is a nice one.,ftlgame,dgotfvy,8,t5_2tnu1

More importantly though Hull Repair is plenty powerful enough on its own  the Drone Arm combo is nice but honestly not that big of a deal compared to how strong Hull Repair is regardless.,ftlgame,dgt9qzx,3,t5_2tnu1
