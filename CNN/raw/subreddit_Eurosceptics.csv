9136403,0,t3_55fmvd,gtAfter  many recent studies demonstrate that the amounts Greece is being held responsible for were never transferred to the Greek authorities. They served mainly to repay private foreign banks in particular French and German ones. Since  credits have been granted to Greece by  States of the Eurozone by the IMF and by the European Stability Mechanism ESM which took over from the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF because Greece no longer has access to the financial markets in another context like Cuba under Spanish domination. Thus the loans are in fact borrowed by third parties and then imposed on Greece under extremely harsh conditions. Less than  of the debt amounts imposed on Greece since  have actually transited via Greeces budget and those sums have been used to finance counterreforms and privatisations. The borrowers mentioned above get financing from private European banks and then use their credit to repay them without the borrowed amounts ever actually going to the Greek treasury. It can be demonstrated that these loans have been of no benefit to the Greek people. They have not improved the countrys economic and financial situation. Quite to the contrary.gtIt should be added that initially the  countries of the Eurozone who granted credits to Greece made profits at the countrys expense by practising abusive interest rates between  and . between  and . The IMF also profited at Greeces expense as did the ECB. ||gtThat Greece is a borrower nation has been a fiction since . That fiction serves the interests of the principal powers of the Eurozone beginning with Germany and France. These major powers themselves defend the interests their major corporations be they banking industrial and in particular arms makers or commercial firms. The major powers have convinced  other Eurozone member countries and the IMF to maintain the fiction with the complicity of the Greek authorities. The European Stability Mechanism ESM and the ECB participate in furthering the narrative. Big capital in Greece banking commercial  e.g. shipping  etc. itself profits from the situation.,Eurosceptics,d8a3t1e,2,t5_2ywmh
9178237,0,t3_55tws9,I wish people would just STFU about FTSE ...gtThe FTSE  index is now up nearly  since February and has climbed  since referendum day on  June.This is what wikipedia saysgtA large slice of these are international companies however so the indexs movements are a fairly weak indicator of how the UK economy is faring.gtCompanies must meet a number of requirements .. having a full listing on the London Stock Exchange with a Sterling or Euro denominated price .So not only its international companies but most of the growth is explained away by the exchange rate of the pound and the fact that the global economy didnt really hitch as much as the UK one did on the reveal of the vote. And also measuring from february is very dishonest because from that graph there was some sort of seasonal dip or something else. Now how did the more local FTSE  do?Well it grew  from previous year this day this month and if we adjust that number by the dip of the exchange rate of the pound it has shrunk by a whopping .Alright I made a quick table in Docs now with correct numbers more stocks and conditional formatting.  China had some troubling news thats the drop doesnt change the situation though.,Eurosceptics,d8fepxf,1,t5_2ywmh
11006568,0,t1_defhny7,Freedom of speech at least in the Western European sense exists to ensure the free debate of politics. But how much actual criticism can you speaking honestly see in the act of posting images of beheadings? Her ability to legitimately criticise somebody or something remains unhindered she could have just posted verbally using word whatever she had to say the violence itself is unnecessary. Or was it a sign of endorsement of the death penalty or beheadings? Then the issue is even clearer gratuitous violence isnt acceptable in a civilised society ever. If her ability of expressing a political stance stays intact I dont see how one can make the argument of an encroachment on freedom of speech valid,Eurosceptics,defkat3,1,t5_2ywmh
