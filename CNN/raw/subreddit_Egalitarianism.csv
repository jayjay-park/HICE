Then the guy goes and kicks the bfhusbands ass. Im not saying it is terribly commonI think its very common.  Ive seen this stuff over amp over.

When this is violated equality is void and the crime must be punished relative to the harm done to its victim and society.,Egalitarianism,d2a0z65,7,t5_2sey7

8373633,0,t1_d5o8ixy,You dont know how their penis is working.  Thats the thing.  There can have been many complications.  Circumcision can only lead to complications removal of certain sensory feelings...  Its very seldom needed to help someones health.  So I understand why these men are mad.  It would be like me deciding at birth to inject you with something that didnt let you grow any hair.  Hair isnt needed anymore.  It did protect us from the sun and the wind and...before.  Nowadays its usually about fashion and some can be a sign of masculinity.  Id be robbing you of choices for no reason if I did that.  It doesnt matter if your body is working.  The point is that I stole something from you that you cannot get back when I didnt have to. You called what these men are doing a fear campaign.  I dont see how it is.  When you cut the foreskin there is blood.  They show blood around the genitals.  Its a fact.  It happens.  All scientific literature shows that circumcision has not benefits in  of cases.  So unless there is a medical condition there is no need to remove it.  Doing so is just altering your child because you want to.  The child didnt decide that.  Why make a choice like that for your child when they may not want it and a lot of circumcised men did not want to be and wish they werent.  A parent who does so is giving themselves power over a childs body that they do not need to take.  In egalitarianism you should not be holding power over someones body unless its to save them from harming themselves or to help them.  If the child needs it done then they need it done.  My godson will be having some penile surgeries soon.  Hes  months and we just found out that he penis is crooked on the inside and that his urethra is also crooked.  Decisions are going to be taken on his behalf because he is in pain the pain will get worse the deformity will get worse as he ages...  So what will be done is to have surgery to correct without doing anything unnecessary.  There will be talks with the doctor.  In this case yes we are taking choices over his body but only to avoid him major trauma pain and further issues.,Egalitarianism,d5o95ju,1,t5_2sey7
8388949,0,t1_d5q413p,Its not misogyny in my opinion. If were being literal misogyny is the hatreddislike of women although I have heard that the Australian Macquarie Dictionary recently added entrenched prejudices of women under the definition of misogyny although I dont think thats been adopted by any other dictionary.Under the much more commonly accepted definition the blatant favoritism women receive and the desire for them to receive lesser sentencing would not be misogyny although it certainly would be belittling to women because of the assumed weakness.However since this is an article about Australia and the Macquarie Dictionary is  avalid dictionary to reference from there it can qualify as misogyny. Even though it really only benefits women and ignores the vast inequality the men face in the judicial system.,Egalitarianism,d5q5zuk,8,t5_2sey7
8394240,0,t1_d5pnzkn,Im seeing a trend in a lot of movements from banbossy to BLM to  Ghostbusters to just bait as much controversy as you can while pretending that wasnt really your intent yeah.. right in order to attract the maximal number of eyeballs as well as anger from a chosen tribe of scapegoats just to feed your point and then to pull a bailymotte and pretend to be all reasonable and noncontroversial under the surface in order to win converts after it was your controversy that got their attention in the damned first place.Check the labeling of ragainstmensrights with  Jun   UTC snapshot in case they ever change itThen contrast their cute little disclaimer in the sidebargt We are not against the concept of mens rights we are against the mens rights movementContrast Ban Bossys name and their promotional videos that focus on language policing with their website and PDFs that explicitly claim that language policing is not their focus.This method even lets you trick not only your enemies but your illintentioned allies to think that the soundbite you front with is the real goal so that those allies can get their hands dirty and mix it up with the scapegoats while you dont have to.This is why the media machine is free to not only pillory James Rolfe but sum up  of downvotes against the  GB trailer as nearly a million misogynists. This is why a movement can name itself black lives matter leaning on the English parlance that calling out any one property uniquely to any one group suggests that the property is unique to that group eg it reads without context as black lives uniquely matter or put less gently only black lives matter and lead thousands of crass individuals and protesters to feel sanctified committing crimes against whites and police guided by that false pretense.Really I guess I view this as a systemic problem as much as anything else. I cant work up a lot of anger anymore to individuals exploiting this societywide emotional weakness tabloids have been perfecting it for centuries prior after all. But I would like to give it a name and some shape so that anyone who pays attention can at least recognize it unfolding and start to bear our heels into the dirt against it a little bit.,Egalitarianism,d5qts85,2,t5_2sey7
8494694,0,t1_d62ycb2,Are you a troll or just ignorant? That is exactly what you said.To sum what you are saying up You say modifyingcutting a baby girls genitals in anyways is FGM but for baby boys you can modifycut the foreskin and its not MGM.Just in case you dont understand what Im saying.. MODIFYING BOYS GENITALS IN ANY WAY IS MGM.. YOU ARE WRONG!!Hence womens genitals are worth more than boys in your mindand many others..I feel like you took a course in collage or something and they told you what FGM and MGMCircumcision are and you dont even question it or think for yourself.,Egalitarianism,d63dxzh,1,t5_2sey7
9027407,0,t1_d7ww2q4,I really dont want to get into a GG discussion but in my personal opinion it was never about ethics in journalism. You disagree and thats fine.Regressive means theyre trying to pull society back to an earlier time. So what the hell is a regressive left other than a new buzzword to replace SJW? Other than that phrase I think some MRAs would take issue with you calling MGTOW part of them even radically and Im not sure if youre sayng Vox is a feminism website though obviously pro feminism or that the feminist in the Vox article is hardline. Either way yes its a great bridge for discussion between these groups. Id love to see ML flourish and be able to do some large tangible improvements for men in society.

God made her a woman so please dont say things like that in the future!

9048747,0,t3_546ks3,I have grown to believe this about a large portion. Or that someone has a chip on their shoulder or is mad about some sexist situation maybe at work. And men seem to often be guilted into it the same way that an atheist pretends to be Christian when at grannys house.Then there are those that just say they are feminist out of comraderie but dont actually know anything about the movement.Feminism doesnt exist to help women achieve equality anymore. For instance feminism doesnt fight for equal opportunity at college or else they would advocate for fewer women to go. Feminism today is about promoting privilege for women and in so doing they have to take things away from men.,Egalitarianism,d7zijvq,-2,t5_2sey7

9961589,0,t1_db5s3dh,Ok let me ask you what in that sentence proves he is saying their and not theyre? I think youre making up whatever you think will defend him.Youre literally forcing in the blanks to make him sound better. He speaks in broad terms which implies generalization. Saying a direct statement doesnt imply some in the english language Its a statement meaning a general rule. If my grandmother said weeds are bad while working on her garden I wouldnt assume some. I would take it as a general rule.So what is he contributing by saying there are some rapist? He speaks like overall Its a national problem that theyre coming over and bringing crime not that theyre sending some criminals so we should stop him. That weakens his point beyond reason.His point of that part of the speach is to say illegal immigrants are coming over and its a problem because theyre sending lots of bad people not a weak argument like illegal immigrants are coming over and a number greater than  of them are criminals and rapists. Hes trying to adress a problem and hes not going to do so by giving a haphazard there are illegal immigrants and a majority or minority of them may be criminals.,Egalitarianism,db60rki,1,t5_2sey7
