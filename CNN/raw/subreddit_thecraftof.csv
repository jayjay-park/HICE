6765689,0,t3_46sgjf,Thank you for your feedback. While the story is a fiction it is based on reallife this happened to me years ago  a twitch of the hand and I had to go to a nurse who then had to remove the lens from around the back of my eyeball. My eye was red for a whole week! ,thecraftof,d0j65ah,1,t5_3cf2y
6830530,0,t3_49b2ac,Interesting scene. Definitely starts with action and has dialog that advances the story. However I had to read it a couple of times to get a sense of what was going on. Still left with questions like who did she ? punch in the opening action? Is the fat little bald man to one weighing  lbs? If so then hes not little  The line of His idea of justice confused me. I figured he was some kind of criminal so not sure why hes enforcing some kind of punishment?But I think there is something engaging and interesting here just cant quite see it yet.,thecraftof,d0qjhn6,1,t5_3cf2y
