I believe it is really rare for a stop motion to enter the  hour competitions as it is very time consuming compared to live action.,stop_motion,cjrizcc,1,t5_2sol2

10949137,0,t1_de9a9t9,Oh cool idea! Yea the Yoda one was just a test. I have the set taped down now and Im using my phone camera instead. I made a makeshift stand out of Lego that holds it still and Im careful to just barely tap the capture button to not disturb it. I also found a better lamp to use for lighting and Im gonna a try and find some colored paper to use.,stop_motion,de9bqwp,1,t5_2sol2
