Starts one hour before kick off forgot how much time after kickoff before they want you to come and get it but its more than enough time to navigate the crowd. My daughter and I used the bike valet once last year. Cycling through the north side of city campus was easy it was fun passing the line of cars trying to get into the garage.

Maybe Im visiting one of my relatives graves while Im there after all!Im just waiting for the various churches in Lincoln to start bitching about the increase in parking lot traffic as well.Fuck Arlington for that policy. Its in no way disrespectful. Disrespectful is burying our soldiers then ignoring that they even exist. Just a bunch of fucking old people shaking their fist at the sky like usual.,lincoln,d59x31h,4,t5_2s5gj

8537652,0,t3_4wn29b,Ive had vehicles done at all  shops. I had been going to Pro Tint since I was  and theyve always done a great job. Not a single issue in  vehicles Ive had done there. Never had any issues with product or their customer service.Most recently I went to the The Tint Shop with my new truck because they were able to get me in immediately and Pro Tint was a week out. I was very impressed with their quality of work. I was also very impressed with the quality of work done here and they use M as well. GP Customs has gotten a lot better in the last few years. When they started out on th and O their Tint work was questionable. However I picked up a cheap work car and I had them tint the windows since it was the closest shop to my house. Although I am overly impressed with SunTek window tint their customer service is second to none. They stayed after hours to finish my car to ensure it was done correctly. I wouldnt hesitate to go back again based solely on that. I can live with the difference in SunTek and M.Stop and talk to each shop and then choose who you feel most comfortable with. You really cant go wrong at any of these  shops.,lincoln,d68rulw,2,t5_2s5gj
8548706,0,t1_d69z7qq,No the bike lane was a pretty awful way to spruce up the selling point of downtown real estate by using TIF funds from developers who are putting up large student housing projects in the wake of UNL expansion.Dont get me wroung its fine but it isnt altruistic or indicative of focus on bike oriented travel. For that look literally anywhere else in the city  almost all bike development has been focused on recreational travel i.e. in parks. Its still pretty unwise to commute by bike.,lincoln,d6a5rye,1,t5_2s5gj

The driver got hopelessly lost trying to find my work right next to gateway mall even though they swore to me they went there all the time to deliver and knew right where it was.
