7467713,0,t3_4hn2yd,The single game Ive played the most except for EVE Online and that doesnt count is Napoleon Total War. Released as a stand alone game many criticized it as a cash grab a reskinned Empire Total War that didnt add anything different. That was far from the truth.Napoleon Total War understands Napoleonic Warfare best warfare based on movement and maneuver rather than pure fire power. As a result cavalry was weak and slow while artillery was only useful for shrapnel shot and canister.This is where Napoleon changes everything. Not a tweak of Empire it stands on its own and is capable. Infantry move quickly and depending on the nation they will change formation based on orders cavalry is powerful and deadly again depending on whether you use a mixed French cavalry corps or Polish heavy lances and artillery is powerful and loads quickly depending on the nation French guns are the best while German guns are the worst.The best part of NTW is how it got me introduced into the Early Modern Era. I played Empire but its honestly a bad game. I had a friend at the time that was destroying me in game so that made me go understand the era better and the tactics. After a full year or so if study on just Napoleonic Tactics I quickly gained a competency that I never lost. To this day I still defeat anyone that dares deny the superiority of French arms.,EarlyModernEurope,d2r1728,3,t5_3edej
7611309,0,t1_d367zxs,Thank you for your very insightful post its great to have more of the French perspective on the topic! You bring up a very good point which is to view the Wars of Religion as a conflict not as simplistically between Catholics and Huguenots but rather between various factions with the crown in a very uncomfortable position. There are aspects of this that I wish I knew more of. Paris seems to have been a particularly conservative Catholic city. Was this a reflection of most of its residents or was this more due to conservatism in its university and among its nobles? Why were there so many castles built in the Loire Valley associated with figures of this era? Chteaux de Chambord dAzayleRideau and of course de Chenonceau were all built around the era of Francis I to Charles IX. Both Diane de Poitiers and Catherine de Medici were sent to live here. The Spanish plot that you bring up seems very plausible too. Only a few years later in March  Philip II of Spain declared William Orange an outlaw and put a bounty on his head. On  July  Balthasar Grard a Burgundian Catholic successfully made his way into Williams circle and assassinated him on a stairwell. Grard had previously met with Alessandro Farnese to present his plans only for Farnese to dismiss it as folly. Was this reflective of Spanish attitude toward Coligny or the willingness of Spanish agents  sanctioned or otherwise  to take action against their enemies? Could Grard have been inspired by the attempt on Coligny? Could Philip II have been inspired? The outbreak of War in France did have a major impact on Spains strategic outlook in the Low Countries up to and including Farneses Army of Flanders rescuing Paris from the Huguenot Henrys siege of . If he had succeeded Henry may not have had to celebrate a mass to enter Paris to be king. It is very interesting what you wrote on why Charles IX took the blame or credit for what has happened for the sake of the Idea of Kingship. I had not thought of Jacques Clments killing of Henry IV as being motivated by this loss of Tenant de Dieu idea thanks for pointing it out. What was the attitude of the Parlement de Paris at that time? I am surprised that in  they could not agree on a suitable successor to Charles de Bourbon and didnt want Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia to be crowned. Otherwise we may have seen the reverse of what eventually happened in the Spanish War of Succession! I enjoyed your post very much thanks. It is a very fascinating subject that I wish I can learn more about and I learned a lot from you. Finally thanks for correcting me on the omission of Francis I the young king D. If he had lived the history of England will have been very different what with his marriage to Mary Queen of Scots. Cheers! ,EarlyModernEurope,d37d6zj,1,t5_3edej
7689519,0,t3_4kngxh,This weeks banner is thanks to the suggestion of uOakHeartIX  the magnificent painting of Le Cardinal de Richelieu au sige de La Rochelle by HenriPaul Motte. There is rich context in this painting. The Cardinal is shown wearing Red signifying his status in the Catholic Church. Yet he also wears armor showing his martial status. He became Louis XIIIs Chief Minister or First Minister his lifelong work setting the foundation for transforming France into a strong centralized state. He espoused the policy of attacking the Habsburgs everywhere and pushed France into the Thirty Years War. In this painting he was shown personally supervising the Siege of La Rochelle a Protestant stronghold on the western coast of France. Barriers were erected in the form of a seawall to stop English reinforcements and supplies from the sea. The victory of royal forces against Protestants sealed the fate of religious tolerance in France the Edict of Nantes was revoked and Protestantism no longer tolerated. Yet within a short period he brought France into the Thirty Years War first as a financier and indirect supporter of Protestants and later on as a direct belligerent. The Cardinal is variously portrayed as hero and villain. In The Three Musketeers he is a cynical political devil holding the king as his puppet. Yet in Cyrano de Bergerac he was a wise statesman. What do you think about the Cardinal and his legacy? ,EarlyModernEurope,d3g8zae,3,t5_3edej
9946251,0,t1_db1xe26,Very nice post thanks! Putting on my early modern Europe perspective if this were to happen in Europe I would expect to see fragmentation into smaller competing states. When China became exposed to Europeans in the s and s there seems to be a perfect period for peripheral states to emerge. We did see this in Koxingas maritime kingdom. But even then in my limited knowledge of the political structure of that time the situation seems very different when I compare lets say Chinese commanders and European commanders. When the Duke of Alba was asked to march the Army of Flanders up from Italy to the Low Countries he had to pawn off his land holdings and raise up to  of the cost with the expectation that he would be rewarded in the future and he did. Enterpreneurs took on both leadership and financing and this happened at all levels colonels captains. Over time there were increasing levels of bundling from Albas model king raises army Alba leads and maintains to Spinolas model he raises army leds and maintains it to Wallensteins model he raises taxes for maintenance from territories he controlled. How was the situation in China with the commanders you mentioned if I understand correctly they are from the Yuan era? Conversely relative stability at the highest rungs of nobility means creditors were willing to provide loans. In EME this led to stronger kings and emperors and weaker lower nobility unless they engaged in enterprise. To give an example if you were Jakob Fugger would you give loan to the King of Spain or the Duke of Pomerania? You may loan to both but with the latter you risk him losing his duchy altogether. Does this agree with what you see in China? Was it like the lack of diversity as you and udandannoodles uterminustrantor have said? If we shift eastwards to Japan was Sengoku Japan too volatile  despite the rich diversity of factions  and Edo Japan too centralized? Ping uparallelpainCheers! ,EarlyModernEurope,db40sfv,2,t5_3edej
