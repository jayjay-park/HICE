1196524,0,t3_22t3gb,Is this still a talking point? I know Im still a new memember to the server but I enjoy the large builds and with most of them already constructed on the server its sort of not as fun for the newer players. Alot of the new players also joined in recent days many of us have talked about it on the teamspeak Ive walked around spawn and looked at the empty shops checking when the owners were last online..some  month some nearly ..yet no new plots are being created to allow for newer players to be able to have a stab at selling their goods in a shop? Im all for the map reset and with the new blocks it would make an interesting style of redecoration.,CubeKrowd,ci486x6,1,t5_2xn16

1298330,0,t1_cifm3ta,JL is surveying the idea of a nd survival world I advise against it personally but it will be his decision. If we were to do a second survival world Id really prefer it to actually be unique.For example I am learning WorldPainter. Would be pretty sweet to maybe make the initial play area in world painter this would keep everyone pretty confined to get started and also give a reason for building closer to spawn Custom terrain vs generic MC terrain. But I am very new to world painter so I dont know how long itd be before I felt comfortable releasing that as a play ready work.,CubeKrowd,cifog88,1,t5_2xn16
