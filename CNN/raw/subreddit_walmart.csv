913482,0,t3_242hrl,They used to have one at my store when it was  hours but when they switched to  am to  pm they got rid of the position. Until recently I was a cashier who always worked  when it was slow. About  months ago I got an accounting position to cover whenever they took time off and I work  when they dont need me in the cash office. Im constantly working on it but havent caught up yet. The corner by the CSS podium usually has  rocket carts and L carts full of merchandise to go out because nobody besides me works on it. Back room and overnights rarely bins anything for me they usually dump everything up front for me so I have to do that to keep the front end looking nice. Not to mention the dozens of modulars that are weeks late.  I asked management if they would make me the dept mgr since Im doing that kind of work most of the time and secondary me in the cash office but I was told there wasnt a dept  mgr so I couldnt do that. I have to have a manager or a Z sign into the SMART system on the palm so I can order anything.

1577217,0,t1_cjds9zv,I think it is somewhat accurate but you are forgetting our company motto. Save money live better. Walmart does not mark up products most grocers have margins of  Walmart is under  they work on small margins and hope that volume makes up for it. If they raised their prices they would be going against everything the company stands for Every Day Low Prices. I think that Walmart could raise wages and they have even so much as said they are in favor of min. wage increases but as a business you cant really expect them to start paying their associates more when they are almost in line with industry averages. It may not be ideal but at the end of the day they have a business to run. If everyone else were forced to do it Im sure Walmart would have no issues but to put all this pressure on Walmart and to ignore other retailers like Target Kroger essentially all grocers I worked at a grocery store for  years I was making . when I left puts a lot of pressure on  retailer to essentially stop doing what they were founded on simply to pay just their associates more. ,walmart,cjdzbp6,-1,t5_2semr

The only exception is when an item has been bought and not been replaced yet through the system which happens roughly every  hours. So unless the ims arent doing their jobs or the department managers arent ordering properly things should be taking less than  weeks to get back in stock. But all we can see is if it is ordered  weeks until arriving or in transit less than week until arriving. Now contrary to the popular belief of my customers the back room is  overstock of what is on the floor deletedwaiting to be clearanced items new items not released or event items. Very seldomly is extra of the product we are out of on the floor in the back room.Of course there are exceptions to everything but most of the time this is how it works.My guess on their attitude though would be them just tired of generalistic statement inbound lazy snobby people in mart carts not wanting to actually LOOK for something.

3228633,0,t3_2x3sxh,Harder. Your allocated less people. Try doing  picks with one person and an unloader who leaves at midnite. Luckily they only want  percent done and even that is not heavily pushed yet. Last year it was hundred percent mandatory and we had to send an excel email to the MM by am.Now my last store had a truck ever night and not just remix every other night so we had  ims plus Support plus  unloaders plus the fdd guys did their own. There may have been  more picks but it was manageable. Also they started picks at  there. Here we are lucky if the ims is scheduled before pm.Days they have the backroom asm used to just be the backroom supervisor and an ims associate all day. Now its just the asm and Ims associate until the nd shift B.S comes in to unload the truck. We also only get one night csm so some nights there is no csm. The nd shift csm stays till midnight to change out registers or the support and asm do it. Then the cashier needs the night managers to fill in for her break.As for associates there are always enough so that if one calls in you are not finishing freight or getting a decent zone you choose. Since they are crazy about zoning we usually just dont finish sometimes.But again we get less freight. FDD every other night and Every other night its just Remix. That means the night with a full truck we are getting a lot of stuff though to make up for the nights we get nothing. I believe if a truck is not  percent full the DC will not deliver it or something ours never fills up daily so that is why we get it every other. With the occassional two in a row. But because of that we always get a  hour night in paper or something stupid. Then a  in dairy and  mix. Always something big like that.Hope that helped?,walmart,cowni15,2,t5_2semr

Five days allows them to focus on their area and really be able to teach and train their associates.  Of course with this you dont need a zms position which allows to have MORE department managers focused on a SMALLER areaswith an ASM who is there more often.I understand the backlash as it definitely provides a worse worklife balance for the management team as they rarely leave on time and if a day has to be cut then they lose out even more than before.

3947045,0,t3_33fj4y,I would rather be a CSM than a cashier or sales floor associate. However depending on the day and the store it can be like herding cats. If you are able to easily forget about work stresses once you clock out then it would be something to consider. At one point I was so stressed that management was going to coach me for something simple just because we had so much turmoil on the front end and no solid leadership from higher ups that I wasnt really sure what was expected of me. My ZS told me that she could see me taking her position one day before they did away with Zs and even then shes not really sure about whether her position is going away or not if I really wanted toso I mustve been doing something right even if the assistant makes me feel like I suck at it. A few cashiers hated me just because I got the position. I hadnt been there  months yet they didnt apply neither did I but the ZS wanted to interview me and the store manager accepted the change. It would be good to have said at a cashier meeting that even if they dont like who has become CSM they will need to put that behind them because our focus is on customer service. High volume of customers with little coverage on cashiers or CSMs can be stressful. It just depends on how well you work under pressure in that case. When Walmart does what we call at my store a mass hiring where they have a bunch of new associates it can be a challenge because you have so many new cashiers that are requesting your assistance. It all goes down to coverage on this type of stress. ,walmart,cr6749k,2,t5_2semr

My trainer told me to use the prep table by the slicers so I could see and help any customers that came by. She was in the back making sandwiches. I made my salads uninterrupted when suddenly I got a phone call. It was one of the other  managers not our ASM who said an elderly lady complained that she had stood in front of the meat case for  minutes and no one came out to help her. I told him I had no idea what she was talking about Id been there for the last hour and no one had came by. I explained how Id been standing and said I would have seen her if shed really been there at all especially if she were there for  minutes. He said that she was probably looking to cause trouble and that hed send her back to be helped. I go back to making salads. I keep an eye out for an old lady to be creeping up but again no one comes. I go in the back to tell my trainer that someone complained without even coming to the deli but the phone rings before I can get back to the prep room. Its the same manager. Hes obviously annoyed now. The same woman came back to him and complained that she came back to the deli and none of the associates were wearing hair nets. She claimed she saw three employees without hair nets. There were only two people there both of is were wearing hair nets and she still hadnt been back to the deli at all.I told the manager all of this and he said hed handle the problem.

Obviously this meant one less day I could work but Id rather always have the same day off than possibly work on a day where Im likely going to be alone .

His girlfriends an overnight support manager and for the three weeks he was on the CAP team he just walked around the store with her flirting for the first two hours.One of them gets extremely irritated when anyone asks him anything and starts shouting at customers unless theyre underage and then hell sell them knives he shouldnt but hey he got the job with two coachings and it doesnt bother management.One of them was was an overnight stocked who knows absolutely nothing about the SMART system and said that he is going to replace every unit of measure label in the store with a regular shelf label because UOM labels are stupid.Another was an overnight CSM that got that job by lying on his application about his previous experience and then bragged to the whole store about it.

Being alone and needing to get everything done I was rushing and not paying attention. If you ever have worked with rpcs you know they interlock with eachother. I grabbed the top rpc of lettuce but didnt pull it up enough. The bottom rpc of lettuce came down on my ankel. Some words were said tears nearly fell. I finished with help around am when i filled the report. I didnt go to the doctor or anything until the next day. Just a sprain.

Personally I just moved from Unloader Supervisor to Grocery Support and I couldnt be happier. I was the Unloader Supervisor for over  years and its super taxing on your body not to mention the mind fuck that your backroom is going to be blown up every winter with The Event amp Christmas.Also get rid of the notion there is a lead Unloader anymore. You now have to supervise the whole Cap Team . Making sure your GM trucks are getting done  a fast pace. Supervising the team down stacking Remix and staffing it correctly down to working aisles within time restraints. Its now a much bigger job. Shit it was already stressful  times. Like I said give the support job a chance. How did you feel betrayed by your backroom ASM amp CO? Because they didnt inform you of the Cap  Sup opening up?

4998973,0,t3_3j8jy3,Fellow Electronics associate here. A few thingsampnbspI dont know what its like at your store but at mine and many others staying past your scheduled end time is heavily frowned upon. Dont let management department or ASM take advantage of you like that with your schedule. Theyre probably going to be taking plenty of advantage of you when it comes to what they expect you to accomplish versus the coverage they give you. Dont be a pushover and let them tell you that you cant stay past schedule one week then try to coerce you into staying past schedule one day when they didnt schedule a closer.It varies by store but from my experience and stories on here Electronics is ridden pretty hard as far as what they are responsible for and what management expects. If your managers are like mine they will abuse you if you dont stand up to them. Dont be a dick but if you know that theyre trying to make you do something that you dont have to or are incapable of doing because of coverage issues  let them know.,walmart,cuokac5,1,t5_2semr

GM side the best way to handle it is just carry  carts.  One with new freight in it however many you can fit in the cart that go to the same aisle and another for cardboard.ampnbspNew modSix star is counted as normal freight since all you have to do it pick it up and throw it on your overstock palletcart Little time used per piece.ampnbspAnd yes it is normal for times to be off.  Sometimes they are spot on sometimes its just stupidly off.  EX  Once i saw a estimated time to stock a cereal isle with   pallets as  mins.  Management are suppose to walk the floor   and adjust times as they see fit.  Thought usually at least at my store we just go with the defaults.  If it seems reasonable task inout as usual.

Are they standing around?ya one of the things CAP has done right is put more employees on sales floor during our busiest times As you look for a cashier is it easy to find one? Do you have to wait?Easy to find depending on time and day determines the wait time. like today there was always a long line cos its st of month so everyone with a govt check was there How many people asked to help you? How many smiles did you get from associates?only asked to help if i looked lost. quite a few smiles if made eye count,walmart,cvmk1q1,2,t5_2semr

5538943,0,t3_3qxecs,You cant but you can get by if you have to. For best results all of your inventory operations should be done under MyProductivityCAP using SMART only when you understand how it differs.  Shelf Availability works exactly the same way with the caveat that it defaults to printing the report for yesterday and defaults to printing the whole store report. One thing to note is that it creates a pick for the item if it is binned. If you bin an item after scanning Shelf Availability it will not be on the Pick List nor will In The Backroom will signal to restock it. Keep It StockedIn The Backroom signals to restock an item when the onhand is less than the shelf cap whereas Backroom Tool subtracts the binned quantity from the total and the case size from the shelf cap. They are not the same. Using In The Backroom and then auditing will not pick all of the items that using Backroom Tool will. In The Backroom does show you the relevant information for you to make that decision but it wont alert you. I use In The Backroom when prepping or slotting freight or mystery carts because it alerts me to things that may not have been worked or should be reworked without having to go through the whole Backroom Tool process.,walmart,cwjncti,2,t5_2semr

My best piece of advice is to try to know your job better than anyone else. Not sure what your support over but there is lots of info on the wire. Take  minutes after your lunch break and use the search function and look for things pertaining to your position. This is literally part of your job. Ive won bets with my on comanager on safety issues because I paid attention to the CBLs. Im always covered because I follow SOP. If anyone challenges me I can print the SOP and the issue is typically resolved. It really just comes down to if youre willing to risk your job by listening to someone who has very little care about you personally. They will ask you to do all sorts of things against policy. Ive seen supports asked to climb into the compactor chute to clear a jam. Saying that it was okay if there was a salaried member of management present.

5758810,0,t3_3two2f,Depends on if your store does it the right way in bakery or their own way. There are stupid labels that say French Sesame French etc with UPCs on them and then they need a use by sticker from a telzon. Or you can be like my store and just use the PLUs and print stickers from a scale. Which is easier. And has the dates so no use by stickers. If its the brown labels printed from the scale it means someone needs to take the labels out and wipe down the print head. Its not hard people are just lazy. ,walmart,cxaxo04,1,t5_2semr

I wonder if anyone is in line out there already. Is that line going to be for certain things? Otherwise why arent they standing around the pallets inside like at your store? Last night was crazy. I worked  and it just got busier and busier all night. By am my register had  people in line my CSS told me to turn off the light even though I was in the lane that cashes checks and does returns after the money center closes. Then the Support Manager almost had a fit trying to tell her she cant close that one and they sat and argued. But as it was after I signed off they only had like  ON people who can cashier out there plus self checkout they each had like  people in their lines. Ughhh.

They moved the DM of Furniture to PampC and dumped Furniture on one of the other DMs.  of the st shift associates quit over the summer and one quits next week.  of the closers quit and the rd is on maternity leave. Now throughout all of Homelines we have  DMs and nothing else. However next month the DM of HousewaresFurniture goes on pregnancy leave. That leaves us with ONE person in...SEVEN departments? An entire section of the store. They already said they werent planning to replace anyone.Oh and heres my favorite part about our staffing. If our one ON CSS is off then we have no cashiers. Literally. None. On Thanksgiving night we had ZERO registers open. Weve been forcing customers to use Self Checkout at night for a few months now. Its terrible. Our lines are awful and its turning customers off from shopping at our store big time. Sales have been down and slipping. Past few weeks averaged .,walmart,cy4fr6a,5,t5_2semr

6302758,0,t1_cz61d35,The story of bobguyIve made minimum wage for a very long time and lived very poorly in fact in a ghetto trailer park paying lot rent at  dollars a month cause I couldnt afford to rent a house well I could but I choose not to so for three years making k a year I lived like shit so I could pay cash for a cheap little k dollar house just so I didnt have to pay lot rent and could have that extra  dollars a month and a little less likely that I would be shot.After working for many years very hard and struggling and going with out  I finally started making a little more then minimum wage so I can afford to buy eggs now  and run the heater in the winter instead of just putting on more clothing.But now poor bobguy wage is once again the minimum because the minimum is higher so now everyone can afford those eggs and to run there heater currently for a little bit .... But now the power company has to spend more on making more power so they have to raise the rates  theres not more chickens laying eggs so as a shortage happens price of eggs will go up and once again bob guy wont be able to afford them.Lets not talk about how bobguy has k saved in a retirement account because bobguy was smart and lived within his means  that will soon be worth less.Oh and lets not forget the years bobguy spent riding a bike till he could afford an electric bike to eventually being able to afford a bus ticket to finally a car.My point is I would rather keep the difference in my pay that I struggled for even if it was a  difference then new highers I would of still worked my ass off to get that  so I could afford  more then someone just starting ,walmart,cz61wh8,-8,t5_2semr

They can also move you from full to part time without notice so if you once had  hours and no longer do make sure you havent been recoded. Its likely that the home office is making the schedule. With the recent announcement of changes the schedules are suppose to be automatic. The Assistants can still change them IE alter times on days you were given or switch days but they have to work within the hours you were given. Otherwise any additional hours you receive will have to be marked as Business Need which if they use too many of these may cause a red flag. Automatic scheduling looks at two things How long have you been there? What is your availability? Seniority is first priority then open availability is second. If you have a closed availability unfortunately this means you wont get hours. While they claim they want to give the power back to us as far as when we will work the new Customer First system contradicts that completely and destroys the notion. You can by all means say you dont want to work Sunday or Saturday for instance but you likely wont get your  either.,walmart,cztba1u,0,t5_2semr

Walmart is under a lot of pressure by unions and the government because  of its employees are on welfare due to low wages. They raise the wages profits still suck so they blame the low profits on the  raise even though there are tons of people who have been working at DCs forever making  starting out since day one. amazon is the worlds dominant retailer. The days of walmart are counting down. It may be years before this happens when it does...Amazon will still be around. When you compare walmart stocked to amazon though...it really isnt the same thing. Their stock is around  walmarts is high  on a good day. And looking at total profits is stupid. A company that has only been big for under  years compared to a company that has been going as long as walmart has. Im just pointing out walmart blames profit loss on employees while still paying them shit wages amazon turns profits while paying their employees above walmart.

The truth is he just doesnt want mods done while he works because he doesnt want to worry if theyll get done properly or not. Also he wants the extra hands to put up stock. So a couple ailed have price tags flipped around. That of course overtime leads to people not knowing where to place something or how many facings. Since the tags are also for a mod thats a year sometimes out of date and the on manager seems to want to push freight out even if it means having five rows where its likely there should be two or three... Its a tough thing for even a newly trained mod team member to then see such a problem and report it to daytime dept managers and not have changed made. Walmart is nothing like their training videos. Id say be glad your store at least has a mod team and it gets to do its job. The title yes is better for someone who wants to move up. Its not worth it to them to pay an extra buck or two an hour.

For most people that is fine but for lots its not worth it because you can use the money for better things actually you can invest it for better return.For majority of walmart workers it makes sense to not loan the government money since they make so little at end of year W wont make a big change.Just remember you will get less back if you are used to that and end of year.The only caution to be had is doing it to often you could end up owning them money.  But generally doing it at least half the year is safe.,walmart,d366dhb,2,t5_2semr

Ive seen two stockers given support one that was good at it but stepped down due to not being able to say no to friends hes gained over the years and the other hasnt started yet but doesnt have the capabilities in my opinion anyways he definitely wouldnt be able to get my respect and another was given CAP  supervisor while only having been with the company for maybe  months dont remember and she had no experience with CAP other than with binning and some other small things but she is damn good at it. My point is you can go into a position not knowing anything and quite a few do and still be damn good...or you could totally flop. I highly recommend findingwaiting for an open position within the next two months pushing for it with your SM and the ASM over that area and if they dont give it to you then simply transfer and give another store a chance. Some stores are harder to be promoted at than others mine is the hardest to get promoted at in the area we have positions open all the time and recently just had a CO open up a couple ASMs open up among quite a few supervisory positions and only some were filled by internals from our store...others by internals from another store.

Something similar happened to me where despite a clean record I was fired for a single small offense saying literally  words.  Last I heard they were still trying to fill my spot.  Just keep looking for work.  Find a good coworker manager or supervisor and ask them if you can use them as a reference.  File for unemployment.  Update your Resume.

The frontend takes priority because this is where the largest impression is made on customers we can either make them very happy by being quick or we can make them very angry by not managing the long lines. I understand cashiering sucks especially when youre in another department but you have to realize this affects EVERYONE including management. If youve got long lines your store is more than likely will get bad reviews on the survey which brings down the average which the MMRM and senior management can see and it will also affect your MyShare. It especially sucks that departments suffer because of it but you have a legitimate reason so it doesnt really matter.

8920549,0,t1_d7j5t9n,The customer satisfaction gift cards dont really impact profit in a practical way. IIRC the average store sales are roughly  million a year. You can run the numbers yourself for what feels right for you but if one of these is given out per week thats  a year or some astronomically low percentage compared to sales. Management would need to be giving these out multiple times per day every day for it to have a statistical significance. Also giving out customer satisfaction gift cards might increase profit.

If made plenty of bales years ago when I was a cart pusher at a small Walmart and I think  out of every  gave me a problem that took like  minutes or more.  So if its that hard you must be doing it wrong.  You can the steel rod through and if you cant you use your cutter and then the rod.  Not rocket science.Most bales take  minutes and once in a while you gotta put everything into ramming that rod through the cardboard bunched up in the back and it takes an extra minute or two.

We are supervisedled partially by our Shift Manager and partially selfled often we just set whatever mod needs setting the most.  Manager is often too busy to deal with us and the rest of the store.  We all get along well currently so its not a big deal we just work.Quick story though one of our former mod team associates used to be a DM and after getting forced out of two departments they sent her to nights to join the mod team.  She appointed herself the boss and tried to tell us what to do.  For some strange reason management never did anything about her seriously it was ridiculous that they did nothing but we all ignored her anyways.  She was the most condescending and selfrighteous person I have ever met in my life.  She went around lying about us being slow or mean to her to other associates.  She herself barely knew how to set mods it took her forever and she never did it right even though she supposedly knew how to and was on some sort of mod team years ago at another store.  One of the people on our mod team quit because of her two went to days and another threatened to kill her.  She has since transferred to a store in IIRC Flagstaff AZ so if any of you in Arizona have recently got a new transfer who claims she used to be a mod team supervisor in Florida and acts like a psychotic bitch I wish you my deepest condolences.

Are you asking for some time off before having the baby...then come back and go back out when you give birth? Your doctor would need to fill out all the forms and you would need a physicalmental reason for needing this time off. Stores do not make these decisions. The rd party company does. We have had women go out for a few weeks before having the baby due to bedrest required by a doctor but yha ate into the total time they were allowed after having the baby.

The rules you bend for one customer are the same rules youll have to bend for every customer afterwards believe me they do talk and word gets around when someone circumvents a policy to handle an issue. I think your manager has a misunderstanding of what happened. She probably bought the customer version of the story without considering your side the customer probably didnt even tell her that she attempted to do an overthephone financial transaction. So your DM has a false impression that you just told the customer a flat No to something you couldve done in the store with the correct ID which she wouldnt produce to you.

WalMart has a very broad spectrum of services and goods so you have to be very flexible in trying to learn a little about everything.

And I understand there isnt a contract additionally my state is atwill. But Walmart has policies of which I cant access readily or even easily... more irresponsibility on the stores end if you ask me even though Im sure Walmarts policy is that each employee should make sure they know the policies and it seems like one should cover this in some form or another.In addition referring to being something to take to HR unless this was a mistake which the assistant manager should fix then I would have to question why is the assistant manager trying to fabricate a reason to fire this person I know atwill but I think Walmart isnt ok with Assistant Managers firing people whenever they feel like it otherwise they wouldnt need to create a reason when they apparently dont have another valid reason to fire that person.removes tinfoil hat But really a lot of stuff with Walmart just defies logic and they should be ashamed.,walmart,dcl87kw,1,t5_2semr

10685429,0,t3_5sr4u0,Im in the same boat as you with being a young hourly  manager  but at a fulfillment  center.  In my area most of the associates have been with the company for  years and do not appreciate a young kid directing them. The number one thing to focus on is the associate. I found that if they see you working and are polite they will usually respect you. I also suggest being straight forward with associates because they will appreciate it more then the corporate bs. Also keep a professional relationship with people under you. Associates will try to buddy up with you and if you allow that it will ruin morale. The second thing I would suggest is learning everything about your area. This can be from salaried managers to taking a couple of classes in business. My area is RSR so I literally begged to be trained on every piece of equipment    and I have a mentorship with a OPS manager. Make your area your baby and take care of it and watch it grow. ,walmart,ddi4dst,1,t5_2semr

The best way to enact change in associates at a particular store though would be to honestly fill out the customer survey the ongoing results of which now directly affect our bonuses. As a company we do actually care about customer service as we know its the only thing retail has over online shopping. May I suggest a little less condescension however? Perhaps Im misreading but it certainly read as if you do not care for Walmart or its associates an attitude which unsurprisingly frequently results in associates not caring for you.

In my DC Dry Unloaders do their own receiving MP and FDD receiving have separate unloaders and receivers.

Verifiers verify the quantity FDD and sellby date DD only of the cases on the pallet then place it into the crane system. I work in a Mech Grocery DC so I dont know if FDD Receiving in the nonmech buildings does verification or not. Orderfiller Unless the moon amp stars align to make you the luckiest person in the world this is what youll come in as. Drive power equipment around the DC and pick the cases that your headset tells you to pick in the order it tells you to pick them for  hours a day occasionally longer.

11168567,0,t3_5zck82,Our store  has an office manager for a store manager.  Rude condescending to the department managers and employees.  She will ask you a question or start a conversation and actually walk away from you as you are speaking or responding.  Many of us have decided we arent chasing behind her like a toddler to speak.  If she cant be respectful long enough to get the answer why bother even answering.  Her micromanage style is overbearing and annoying.  She knit picks people apart until they feel like they are worthless.  She brings NOTHING to the morning meetings.  Every morning its the same bullshit.  She says I dont have anything for you do you have anything for me? and then she says the store looks good and asks an AM or CO to do the Walmart cheer.  Then she goes on a morning tour and plops herself in the office most all day.  She only comes out when she wants to knit pick a DM to pieces or when her front end is blowing up with customers.   She has smoke screened  her boss so much he is blind to see how she treats all the DM and employees.  And she has most all except  of her Co managers acting and treating us the same way.  We call one of the Cos Mr. Coffee....he is always walking around barking orders and sucking on a coffee cup.  Seriously they are all rude.  And they wonder why employee morale is down well HELLO....it starts from the top!  And she calls it Her store all the time.  Ummm.....over  employees in this  hour store keep that place going.

Like the other guy said thanking him will be appreciated but what will be better is getting rid of the dead weight. There are other people like that out there find them.,walmart,dggj956,1,t5_2semr
11655758,0,t3_666stx,Best I got was three ASMs FEZ and a pair of CSMs.  I think a couple cashiers were out there too.But thats what happens day before Easter with only me on the schedule for six hours.  ,walmart,dgh70rc,1,t5_2semr
11660712,0,t1_dghave1,They use our maintenance people first before CSMs if they can help it when cart pushers are needed. When our ASM is running things all the CSMs will be on registers and good luck getting help from any of them. Like the customer that had to wait  minutes for change because things kept coming up preventing her from bringing the change to me. I even had another customer waiting for change by the time she got over to me and half of the money she brought went right to the customers. ,walmart,dghr8rw,1,t5_2semr

11704852,0,t3_66y04s,A desirable area gets busy everywhere. You will be sought out on the sales floor get familiar with adjacent departments as your own. Learn the PI system and associated features of CAP to effectively stock your departments accurately AND as quickly as possible. Carve out a spot for DELNRPLNM  the Department Managers in area may already have a spot merchandises so you wont have to bury the stuff in back. Is not difficult but fast changes occur in planograms feature movements and inventory you need to be reactive to these things ASAP!

11730919,0,t3_67e2su,gtbut it says Sold and shipped by Store name. Not in that case. Price matching is only for items that say sold and shipped by Walmart.Note that sometimes an item that defaults to a Marketplace seller will also be sold by Walmart.com at a price thats more expensive than the third party but lower than the store. Check if there are other sellers.,walmart,dgpqamz,3,t5_2semr

11801301,0,t3_68ds0h,I work inside but before Walmart I was a cart pusher at Target. My back did start hurting after a few months. I started taking ibuprofen. After a few weeks I had to triple the pills to feel anything. I was taking them way too much and decided to wear a back brace which oddly enough did help a bit. Besides that its rough. ,walmart,dgxpvff,2,t5_2semr
