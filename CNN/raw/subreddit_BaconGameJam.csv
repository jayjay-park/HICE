Not a cute little hiccup of a crash but the brownouts in the next room black smoke coming out of the back of the machine evil I have your files and youll never see them again kind of crash.Fortunately I only lost about an hours worth of work and I think I got it back.  Winning state is working.  Now I just have to get losing state to work and a little playtesting....Ive got to finish it soon because Im going to bed before this contest is done because Im not at home in Indiana right now.  Im in China.  Sitting in a hotel room writing a game.  Theyve got to be wondering what all these weird beeping noises coming out of my room are all about.Let em wonder.  Ive got game.  Well almost.,BaconGameJam,cs63043,1,t5_2su3l
