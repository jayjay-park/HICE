I have a good friend who is a guy and guys seem to have a different perspective on porn. Not my perspective. I dont know. Also I have had to deal with past sexual abuse issues so Im kind of  I understand porn but also on one level I dont know if I will ever be on the same page as people who are like  ooh I just got a new computer and the first thing they download is porn. Which is my guy friend who has has multiple computers and you would think would have learned. But no. I ruined my first computer when I found porn no regrets.

2141989,0,t3_2ji2kq,Technically any hate speech no matter how vitriolic or based in ignorance falls under freedom of speech. Anonymity can bring out the worst in some people but I think the biggest cause of these kinds of hateful websites is our own culture if were talking about the US. People believe this stuff because the people in power let it slide. Young people who believe these things probably take heart from the encouragement of their fathers and the tacit approval of some of the authority figures in their life.This is all to say if we want to stop these hateful websites we have to try to change the culture instead of trying to shut down the sites. The websites and their bitter members are a symptom of an old set of beliefs that wont let go. This could simply happen over time as more progressive generations take power and older generations die out or if a large number of people in power publicly come out in support of feminism and equal rights. A reasonable organized movement could also be a big help in spreading awareness and shaming the people who spend their time spouting hateful ignorant bullshit.I honestly think that an organized movement of normal people women and men excluding those who want to turn it into a gender war would be the most effective. The problem would be keeping it focused towards a single tangible goal and making sure that no one tries to decentralize the movement and create a bunch of splinter groups. Most importantly we should remind people that though we have made some great progress the battle is not won. Sexism is not beaten and likely will never fully be beaten in much the same way that racism isnt over despite everything that happened in the s.And there would certainly be people who would have a strong interest in destabilizing such a movement. Human pieces of shit are worried that Anita Sarkeesian dunno if thats spelled right might become a feminism martyr if she were murdered though they would really like to murder her...for pointing out sexism in video games. All of this is hypothetical though. Im not sure that even creating such an organization would be possible right now and there are already plenty of feminism groups in existence trying to change things already though none of them seem to have any prominence.I really hope that one day I can live in a world where the majority of people can look on women as equals and take them seriously even when doing a job that a man usually does. Or when a man is talking to a manager that happens to be a woman he doesnt automatically assume she is the secretary.

Its not my fault. But if I do nothing I become a part of it. And it is not something I want to be a part of. This is a shift Ive been trying to make in how I think about racism. I grew up in a town like the author describes  almost entirely white. I was told racism was over or that it was a problem for racists and racists only to fix  some group that could be vaguely pointed at over there. Theyre the problem not us normal folk. Not society as a whole. Ive known this wasnt true for a while obviously but Ive recently been trying explicitly to shift my language to reflect that. We are the problem. Not them some faceless group of racists who are racists and nothing else. This feels at the same time utterly obvious and totally against the grain to say. Im pretty new to the open discussion of racism though so maybe thats why it feels that way. I dont know. All I know is that I dont want to be part of the problem anymore. ,FemmeThoughts,cmwhjxh,5,t5_2ucc3

Holy hell.It was my way of rationalising away the cognitive dissonance for my own discomfort dislike for my own body. It took me losing the weight getting shamed for losing it and then subsequently getting to a better placewhich was more of a journey in maturity than physical change that made me realise that the shaming is a disgusting practice that said more about ourselves than it does for the people shamed.,FemmeThoughts,cpy13pb,16,t5_2ucc3

Politicians lie theyre slimy twofaced vermin who serve at the bidding of the economic system yet how is Clinton suddenly worse than all the shits that came before her and that will no doubt come after her? Theres something to the argument that its exacerbated by the notion that women are seen as untrustworthy and may be easily discredited.Add to this that shes constantly criticised for how she dresses her tone of voice her status as a mother grandmother etc. These arent candidate things theyre woman things that our sexist society has criticised of any woman with anything resembling fame or stature.What frustrates me in particular is that therell be a lot of postsexist buggers out there who will vote for Clinton and if she were to become president claim then not to be sexist in any other occasion because I voted for Hillary!Or the myriad dudebro fuckface douchebags who will inevitably say nuhuh theres no Patriarchy we got a woman president!,FemmeThoughts,d7iq75c,29,t5_2ucc3

I count myself in the category of White people because no matter how much it offends them there is no White person whose views about race and power have not been shaped by the supremacist ideology inculcated in them from birth. It doesnt come from a book or the aforementioned cabal it comes from messages from an entire society that reinforce it.gt If nonwhite people werent oppressed the ideology of nonwhite identity politicians would be destroyed. As the nature of ideology is to continue itself nonwhite identity politicians will only ever reproduce their own oppression than dismantle it at best they will transform their oppression requiring some new ideology to transform that oppression into a new oppression. What is your argument here? That POC politicians bank solely on their race? That they bank mostly on their race? That POC politicians need to pretend their race does not affect how they are treated in their everyday lives in order to make progress? There is a huge citation needed for your whole claim that identifying race perpetuates racism. You cant just dismiss it with get out of here. Your argument is the sibling of By talking about race youre the real racist and youve done nothing so far to prove it otherwise. I am curious how you expect to counter systems of explicit racial oppression without identifying that theyre based on race and populated by individuals whose behavior is shaped by how society treats their racial category. I suspect the answer is something along the lines of fight capitalism which is a nice thought but has historically failed miserably at addressing these issues. In fact there is a long history of the socialist movement actually perpetuating racial oppression via their stubborn insistence that racism will go away once economic inequality is fixed.,FemmeThoughts,d9a993o,9,t5_2ucc3

9518541,0,t1_d9mc4ap,Thanks I agree. Its totally easy to hear awful allegations about people I dont have any particular fandom for and vilify them Bill Cosby and Woody Allen come to mind and condemn anyone who tries to defend them. But its really different when Ive had an obsession with someone for  years. Ive seen all of his movies. Im not exaggerating. Every. Single. One. It made me feel bad to see the friend I first saw Pirates of the Caribbean with back in  when we both fell in love lash out against Johnny Depp being casted in the next HP film which we both also love when I felt rather excited about it. As a feminist its very upsetting that hes been accused of wife beating but I cant let go of the fact that hes still been my number  celebrity crush since I first hit puberty.

9585495,0,t1_d9ukg47,gtBut why does the US have to be the World Police?This is a policy question and something Im not uptodate on right now. I know from some of my veteran friends and more hawkishRepublican friends is that theres been a sentiment since WWII that turning back conquering armies cant be done without American help. And because we werent involved in WWI and WWII from the beginning we had very little timeoptionschoice in how to fix the problem. I also think that theres quite a bit of guilt once the dead were tallied after WWII that if we had intervened sooner the concentration camps wouldnt have taken so many lives the Russian army wouldnt have the stop em with dead bodies we wouldnt have lost our GIs in Pearl Harbor we may not have even developed the nuclear bomb much less used it twice. My grandpa actually believes that the Cold War and Soviet Russia wouldnt have happened if wed intervened sooner. Again I dont know how accurate any of this is historically Im just trying to demonstrate how American guilt turned into responsibility turned into Imperialism.Its actually quite codependent of us like dumping an alcoholics bottle but perpetuating the dependency cycle.And like a dependency cycle could the rest of the world survive if America unilaterally pulled its support from all conflicts were involved in and retreated back into our borders? So now we feel in too deep to stop. Every decision has exacerbated the problem. It also doesnt help that American policy is largely Democracy at all Cost. Undermining stable yet nondemocratic governments is the absolute worst thing America has done to the world at large.On the BushCheney thing I agree with much of your assessment. I was and am a huge critic of Bush and Cheney. But I worry that on the spectrum Trump may be worse. BushCheney needed a strong Imperial America to further their interests. Its evil and horrible and it weakened us in other ways like our rights as citizens our liberties and our ability to live without fear. Trump I think would sell out America as a whole for something much cheaper. Especially since we havent recovered from the consequences of a Bush administration. You have to realize that in the next two elections  there will be teenagers voting who have never lived in a pre America and have no visceral understanding of what it was like to live without fear of terrorism. Weve made so many compromises in the name of safety that I fear the next generation wont even know that liberty in exchange for safety is not what it means to be American.Edit I should also say that what the average American feels and what our politicians feel are likely two different things and it wouldnt surprise me to know if our collective guilt was regularly manipulated as a way to convince us all to buy into interventionist policy. You just asked why and this is a reflection of why it would be difficult for me and the people I know to let others suffer when we know were strong enough to save them. Although a certain amount of fatigue and resentment is certainly settling in especially in the veterans and armed services communities. So well see how long the populace continues to be moved my guilty machinations.,FemmeThoughts,d9ulw4r,1,t5_2ucc3

Theyre scheduled for Jan  but wont be starting at the far end of the Mall. Instead starting at the Washington Monument marching Constitution Ave to the Capitol then splitting up with some continuing to Congressional offices.Not from the Lincoln Memorial.Two basic points of principle strike me. First the rights of petition and protest are way way more important than the dignity of a Presidential or Congressional inauguration. I mean duh.If an election is contested if feelings and arguments are strong afterwards we have an obligation as a republic to listen. If that means a pretty pictureperfect inauguration cant happen thats really too fucking bad for the victor.Second I dont envy the job of the Park Service. Im sure they appreciate the importance of the Mall and the District of Columbia as a platform for public demonstration. Those spaces need to be open to everyone but maintained in good order. They are actual free speech zones front and center and national treasures because of how they were and are used.

It is common throughout the species and that is the realm in which exotic dancers inhabit.  there is room for both the sexuallysocially regressive and progressive to exist in a realm where they like to explore fantasy. This works for both genders. Your post just reads like it relies on a lot of assumptions or entry level antisex feminism.

10099172,0,t3_5kgdwb,If people could achieve equality by being super sweet to bigots there would be no hatred anymore. After all fighting is so much harder and more dangerous than being pleasant.In my experience there are two flaws with expecting change from niceness. First if bigots generalized good behavior as readily as they do bad behavior they wouldnt be bigots. Which means being kind to them will make you one of the good ones but itll do nothing for the group in general. Second if you do not call them on their views and behavior you run the risk of reinforcing and normalizing them. How many times have you heard somebody say Well I cant be ist because my token friend doesnt get mad about that? What are the chances that friend doesnt actually enjoy hearing their people torn down but theyre just trying to go along to get along?So while Ive never tried being emotionally correct I did spend a lot of my teens keeping my head down.

10471169,0,t3_5pw6kn,I trans woman have mentioned this a couple of times in other subs and it seems to be a common opinion among us so Ill put it here tooThere seems to be a lot of vulvacentrism popping up in feminist speech in general which in general does make me uncomfortable. I understand and agree with the idea of making them less taboo but when genitalia is used as shorthand for what makes me a woman then I think that everyone in this thread would be able to see why that makes us trans women uncomfortable. However. Right now the new president of the United States is a blatant misogynist. And the most famous quote from him that seems to sum up his attitude towards women ends with grab them by the pussy. So there is a lot of speech referencing vaginas and vulvas right now that is directed specifically at his attitude towards women and I see no problem with that because its directly linked to that quote. Finally Id just like to clarify something else I saw in this thread which was about how there are a lot of cisgender feminists who say theyre transinclusive then use blatantly transexclusive speech. It seems pretty common in mainstream feminism and I would say it stems from a desire to say youre intersectional without ever having to think about problems that dont affect themselves. You may notice women of colour having similar complaints about many white feminists. So in summary modern feminism still has a long way to go towards being inclusive in general and inclusive of trans people in particular. Just like modern society in general. Vagina and vulvacentrism is part of that and we should attempt to move away from it. However due to the whole pussy grabbing thing at the moment right now is actually a time when genitalfocussed speech is appropriate. Also just like to point out that most trans feminists understand that intersectional feminism IS also about us and just generally one of the best things going regarding societal change. So if we critique feminist speech from a trans angle its not a critique of feminism at a whole because were not just frienda of feminists we are feminists.

10759680,0,t1_ddpk3bg,Most of the articles I read were scholarly and behind a paywall ie JSTOR. Its worth reading about Helmut Newton and studying his work if youre interested in this sort of thing.Newton wasnt a designer but was a fashion photographer and in his prime you would pick up a fashion magazine Vogue especially and  of the photos were taken by him. He was really into kink and eroticism which of course isnt a bad thing but his photos were very voyeuristic and more about male fantasy than womens enjoyment. I see a lot of what he does in Terry Richardson. So imagine this dudes singular vision of how he thinks a womans body should be portrayed and should look like. Now imagine opening a magazine in the late s and  of what youre looking at is that mans vision. He really shaped fashion photography and people consider his work groundbreaking and provocative. I do think he was brilliant but I dont see his work as having an entirely positive impact on women.Later in his career he started parodying his own work and there are photos he took where his feet are in the photo and hes literally stepping on the model.

11382015,0,t1_dfkqyx9,You dont have to feel a certain way about what Ive said. You can just add to it as you have. Theres no right or wrong personal history in a society theres just how it hits you as you go through it. I have given my personal experiences of observing the parenting dynamic of others in my friend group I didnt go much into my own. As to your personal history and reasons for being hamburger or not you are welcome to go into detail. Even though it sounds like our observations wont match that doesnt make them less interesting or less true. The people Im talking about had self centered yet financially and somewhat otherwise supportive partners and werent single mothers so it wont overlap much. Neither did their situations overlap with mine very much. I am a strange person and my family structure is quite different. I looked like hamburger for my own reasons. As to getting more training. It depends on ones parents and culture but I would not say as a generality that there isnt more training. In the same way I might say little girls get silenced more your or my experience of being encouraged to speak up might be equally true but the overall culture is one that affects us nonetheless. In America if you are a girl child You get handed baby dolls in a way boys dont you get praise for caring for them you get praise for kindness to smaller siblings in a way boys dont you get strong encouragement and pressure to like babies and children in a way boys dont . You get encouraged pressured and praised for cooking skills playing house organizing your room peaceful conflict resolution mild temper gentleness and for tolerating misbehavior from little boys  he just likes you or just ignore them is partly meant as it is your feminine job to endure the burdens of socially and physically incontinent people graciously. You will note I didnt say that women are biologically destined to adore all children. Obviously you can have a different history or mindset than others girls in cities and in certain social classes get less of it for you could be raised by upscale bohemian socialists in s Greenwich village but majority of adult people assume and instruct girl children on baby care or homemaking in a variety of ways. The thing Im pointing out here is that many of these women in my social circle  many of whom worked throughout  are living as partially subsidized single mothers with babysitting men. Which is better than without the subsidies or the babysitting  but as far as I could tell they didnt realize it which was I felt crazymaking. They didnt realize they werent being treated equally in significant ways they werent being seen or understood or empathized with in several ways by their own husbands and boyfriends and they were boiled frogs. Thats just my experience. Life is weird I may have rolled a strange pair of dice and somehow run into  gender dysfunctional childcare arrangements by coincidence.

11792428,0,t1_dgvdzc0,gtreferring to cis men as conventional men.Honestly how would one refer to men who have penises and who identify as men and dress as men that doesnt become indeciferable. A sentence becomes really confusing when youre trying to make a difference clear if you have to CampP a long definition. Writing this out and making myself clear is really difficult in the first place without having to search around for six different ways to describe something you clearly understand. I get that my language isnt perfect here but it just will all get lost in endless jargon. Already my questions arent being answered. gtHow is identifying as straight meaningless? Its attraction based on gender.For decades being straight or gay usually meant that you were attracted to the same sex or the opposite sex. Now it means nothing in a world of trans because its supposed to have nothing to do with however you like the sex of your partner its got to do with what gender they feel they are.gthaving genital preferences and saying that is because youre straight instead of not liking a certain set of genitals is cissexistSo saying you are straight is actually cissexist. Which is the conclusion I always come to when I read all about this. In which case why is what genitals I like cissexist which is what straight means but calling yourself a lesbian straight gay or bi not?What are we supposed to say when someone asks if youre straight or gay? Are we now supposed to inform them of exactly what sort of genitals we like and then hope that doesnt upset someone? gtWhich is pretty reasonable IMO.I would question why Im supposed to accept that someone was born a certain way but I cant be. That I cant be born super hetero despite giving a woman a fair chance and examining it as critically as I can I cant actually have an inborn feeling just the same as a trans person can have a feeling that all is not right with the sexgender they were born as.There are really two groups here. The trans people who feel things and are changing what they need to to fit with how they identify and the cis people who are blank slates. I grew up in the same society as trans people. I dont see how my feelings are formed by society but theirs arent.That is ultimately what is being said here. Trans people by their nature see what is really there but whatever I like or want to be with cant be anything other than unconscious bigotry.Also for many years there has been a concerted information campaign. You dont turn gay you are born that way. What this theory says is that you are turned. So I dont see how I can stand up for gay people with kids and say that kids are born straight or gay and has nothing to do with how they are raised but that theyre not really because their sexuality is informed by the society that they live in and without that maybe that kid would be different.If Im not born with a sexuality thats informed before Im born then gay people arent either. gtHow is identifying as straight meaningless? Its attraction based on gender.gtgtBut thats only liking dicks not being straight or only liking men.So again straight doesnt mean anything. It doesnt say I like men or that I like dicks. Im not trying to be difficult Im really not. It just seems like theres so many problems with this idea. It undercuts everything else even terms that this video uses. Edit Thread was locked before I could reply or get clarification. So message received. Ill continue to accept that Im just cissexist and transphobic and I wont change a thing because Im not going to throw gay people under the bus for a theory I cant justify. ,FemmeThoughts,dgwpmh2,7,t5_2ucc3
