302120,0,t1_cewh2d7,Yeah someone confused Caduceus with the rod of Asclepius primarily because it looked cool.Caduceus was the rod carried by the Greek messenger of the gods Hermes whilst the rod of Asclepius was the rod of the greek god of medicine and healing.So a messengers staff was chosen over the staff of the god of the field.Interesting choice.,Sculpture,cfc2x4a,2,t5_2r8oj

3327873,0,t1_cp6xhoa,Its just cool to see whats possible.  Carving at Ridgway was very humbling on one hand but I pushed myself to exceed what I felt comfortable doing and thats how you grow...  I can already see my work has improved since I got back and I look forward to what my skills will be by next years event.  Hope you can make it!,Sculpture,cp7lsal,2,t5_2r8oj

4477322,0,t1_csuzlmz,Look for rod not tube. The solid acrylic rod comes in sizes down to at least th. There are some adhesives that liquify and wled the acrylic but I have not tested them for light transfer. Neon is popular with artists but it is usually crazy expensive.,Sculpture,csv1auh,1,t5_2r8oj

6276834,0,t3_41ke6s,Thats nice of you to get that for him. I like to use Roma Plastililina medium grade which is an oil based clay that never hardens. Theres a tan and also a gray green variety of color. You cant bake it but you can keep reusing it for different projects. ,Sculpture,cz33sos,1,t5_2r8oj

7233017,0,t3_4ei2wi,At the profile view everything looks good but the first thing i noticed is the mouth when it is at the front view. You should give your self sometime to work on the mouth to give it some structure as well as the teeththe teeth is one of the hardest parts to sculpt. Try drawing the mouth and notice the parts where you have difficulty drawing if you have trouble drawing the mouth at certain parts you will have trouble sculpting that part and you just need more practice or can spend a lot time shaping and reshaping till you come to the desired result. Also when you sculpting try to exaggerate and reduce.  ,Sculpture,d20cait,1,t5_2r8oj

I am a latex halloween mask maker for durable affordable hair application I would recommend standard clear silicone caulk you can buy anywhere like LowesHome Depot in the US or amazon a more expensive stretchy fabric glue called aleenes flexible stretchable fabric glue which starts white and drys clear as well after  hours.,Sculpture,db0me6j,1,t5_2r8oj
10069966,0,t1_dbk4v76,They would be stone. Most bronzes are based on marble so around foundries theres usually places that make and sell marble bases for them. They might have a base that you could carve or they could have raw stone that they could sell you. Just a thought. ,Sculpture,dbk50pp,2,t5_2r8oj
