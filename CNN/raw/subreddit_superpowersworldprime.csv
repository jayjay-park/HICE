93238,0,t3_1v5f1e,The world snapped back into existence all at once for Adam. It wasnt like waking up at your leisure no this had more in common with being woken up by being tossed out of a moving car. Adrenaline surging in his veins his senses hyper aware and his heart beating like a machine gun Adam sprang up from the ground. And saw nothing. Just the same small stone room hed fallen into. There had been a man here though. He looked around for the old man while he tried to get his heart rate under control. There was no sign of the old man but he did see a doorway he hadnt noticed before. Faced with the choice between trying to climb up the walls towards the hole he fell through or exploring the halls of the shrine Adam chose to explore the interior. While he wandered Adam began trying to take stock of what had happened to him.Okay I know I fell through the roof and it was kind of high. How far did I fall? Fifteen feet? Twenty? Where did that man go? What did he mean by take his burden? Did I imagine him? Maybe I hit my head when I fell. That would explain those...things that attacked me. That man was too old to try and pull a Deliverance on me. I wonder if my parents know Im lost yet? Lost in thought Adam doesnt notice the bas relief carving on the walls he passes. The stone images showing an ancient history of guardianship power and tribulations. As he nears the surface exit of the tunnels he also fails to notice subtle wisps of power adding his likeness and his story to the walls. His tenure as The Source has begun and he is none the wiser. As he walks out into the sunlight Adam realizes that he just flawlessly navigated through a dimly lit stone complex he had never been inside of before today. He turns to look at the entrance only to be confronted by the grassy hillside from which he just emerged. I definitely hit my head when I fell he says quietly to himself. The sound of his voice seems to focus him on his situation once again. Okay Adam you have bigger problems to deal with. Youre still lost in the forest its still January in Washington and you still dont have any food or water. Speaking to himself out loud to keeps his focus Adam starts moving away from the hill. And now you dont even know which side of this stupid mountainhill thing youre on he says with a disgusted last look at the hillside. First things first then. Water. I know we were near the Washougal River when we made camp so I cant be to far from it. If I head downhill I might be able to find it. After nearly an hour of walking Adams heart beat hasnt slowed his senses still feel too sharp and he can feel the extra strength and reactions of the adrenaline coursing through him. Its a strange feeling like the rest of his life hes had weights strapped to his body and film over his eyes. He feels great. Unless he thinks morosely. Im delirious from thirst and hunger and Im actually about to pass out. Even that cheerful thought cant keep him from picking up his pace. From a slow energy conserving walk to a brisk walk to a jog and finally to a flat out run. Which he maintains for another hour before he stops in a small clearing. He bends over his hands on his knees expecting to need to catch his breath. He doesnt. His breathing goes from the rapid pumping of his run to normal instantly. He doesnt even feel tired or thirsty. Okay. Something is seriously wrong with me! Before he has time to say anything else a terrible thunderous roar breaks the otherwise silent forest air. Adam freezes and goes silent. Every single instinct buried deep in his DNA is reminding him that there are that want to eat him and to hide and let those things find someone else. Just as his conscious mind is pulling itself back into control another roar rips through the air this one coming from the opposite direction of the first. The first roar sounds again but from considerably closer then its first occurrence. Oh shit Adam says in a quiet monotone. And then he sprints for the nearest tree. Hes twenty feet up before he looks back down at the clearing. He wishes he hadnt. Prowling out from around a bush is a graceful slinking cat. It has the profile of a mountain lion a mountain lion the size of a sedan and seemingly made of obsidian.It casts its bright gold eyes around the clearing and then slowly looks up. Its eerie eyes meet Adams and then the obsidian cats mouth opens in what he swears is anticipation. The sound of a twig snaping breaks Adams gaze free from the obsidian mountain lions. A quick glance to the side shows another one of the stone cats entering the clearing. And then a chuckling laugh draws Adams attention further up the tree hes climbing. Hanging from a parachute thats wound around several tree limbs is a man in a raincoat and a dark suit. Boy you are in trouble! Dont you know cats climb trees?,superpowersworldprime,cep1mqx,2,t5_2zpmc
97122,0,t3_1v5f1e,Continued from this thread...Maedhros Miriel Ros to his friends is an elf from another dimension.  He has spent the night pouring through an old encyclopedia at record speed trying to learn about this fascinating new world he finds himself in.  Almost before realizing it the sun rises and Ryan his new friend wakes up walks into the room and yawns.You want breakfast?Without looking up from the S volume he is currently reading Ros replies.Sure Ill have what youre having.Ros stands up and looks out the window.These encyclopedias are great but some of this information is showing its age.  Like this It says here under Sabertooth that those big cats are extinct but Ive seen two or three large felines prowling down the street in the last hour or so.There is a screech of tires and a gravelly roar Ros moves to the window with the instincts drilled into him during his service in the High Elven Mounted Infantry.  At the intersection a great stone cat has taken a swipe at a passing motorcycle as it slowed.  That cant be normal is it?,superpowersworldprime,cephjlq,1,t5_2zpmc
