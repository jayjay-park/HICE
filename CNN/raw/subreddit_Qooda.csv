1315409,0,t3_27gspv,Yesterday again some unbelievable things happening. Fulltrailer vehicle began to bypass a slower vehicle. Fulltrailer vehicle occupies now the opposite lane. BUT opposite lane was not empty! From a distance came a tiny car with horns fully applied while he drove near the edge of the road. For a split second the road had  vehicles side by side. I was in the tiny car I wish had a video camera in the car just for these occasions.,Qooda,cihlmjg,1,t5_31t5n
