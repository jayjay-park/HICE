6210904,0,t3_40no10,I have a computer that has finally reached the point where it cant play modern AAA games anymore. Which sucks because it means that itll die any day now too its almost  years old. However I found there is a good variety of indie games that run well on my computer. Im an older gamer so my interest have turn towards shorter playthroughs of games. My most recent games Ive come to enjoy is Downwell and Ziggurat. I play Dark Souls too as its stable enough that I can enjoy it but not full fps.Anyways these games are much more challenging which I think is fun. Unlike other games like Skyrim that tries to focus on lots of lore and details. Roguelike games tend to get straight to the point and provide an intense experience all the time. You are rewarded for skillful play by being able to progress further in the game and punished for poor decisions. Granted its not for everyone but its a genre Ive come to love.Eventually my computer will fall so far behind the times that even indie games will be too intensive. Dont think thatll happen for a long time but I do need to replace soon.For now Im saving up my money for a new computer. Even  per two weeks will get you  in a year.

7186170,0,t3_4dv2ob,In your post to rdepression that you linked you refer to having a happy marriage. Im confused as to how it could be that way if youre feeling this low. I dont know anything about being in a marriage but it sounds like your spouse might be out of the loop as far as your emotions being this despondent. If youre fond of your spouse which it sounds like you are then maybe more communication with them could lead to the both of you finding a solution together? Either way I hope things get better for you. I wouldnt call you selfish like you say. Ive thought to myself multiple times before if I were to behave in a way in which I only did what I wanted then I wouldve killed myself already. I think the answer lies in the fact that you have to live for more than yourself while realizing that happiness comes from no where but within. Other people spouse maybe can help you get to that point but its ultimately up to you. I know and feel like that sounds like The Secret positivity bullshit but its still true I think. Be well.,GFD,d1v07k6,5,t5_37qo7
7212183,0,t3_4e61i7,I have not downvoted you but I feel this point would be more effectively made to the general gaming subreddits.  GFDs like myself are in a very unique situation where despair has overridden much of life and sometimes use games as a refuge.  There are also many complaints here from gamers who are so despairing that they no longer have the motivation to play games any more.  What are some of the things that brought you together?  Does he have any other interests or is gaming his only outlet?  Perhaps you can do something else that he is interested in together.  Barring that perhaps there are some interests that you could take up on your own to distract yourself from the loneliness that you feel.  If he still refuses to spend time with you the only thing I can think of for you to get through this is to find something for yourself.  Do not let loneliness overwhelm you.  Do the things that he refuses to do such as making outside friends.  This may even inspire and set a positive example for him.  I wish you the best.,GFD,d1xywa7,7,t5_37qo7

7582669,0,t3_4j6gjh,Ive read through your post and Im going to give you a very abridged version of my own experiences. When I was  I moved to where i lived now and made a friend. This kid and I grew up together I was never the best at making friends but he was and vicariously his friends became my friends. We were all in a group together. Things went pretty well until the games we played started becoming more competitive when the warcraft  mods Like DoTA came out Heroes of newarth League and eventually starcraft  among many other things along the way As we grew up we grew apart these guys started getting into minor drugs girls started to become more important than friends and I became chronically ill. I very quickly learned that I was no longer a friend but a fillin when they needed an extra person. Id only be informed of lan parties after someone else dropped out only invited to games if their other options were offline... The last lan party I went to the entire night they made jokes about how I was suicidal. I never even expressly said I was but i was with these guys for so long they just knew and they made it a jokeIt took me about two weeks to build up the courage In the group skype chat I typed up a really long message calling every single one of them out before leaving. I wanted to express how disappointed I was in their actions both to me and people around them. At that point we were all  starting highschool and shouldve been growing up. I havent heard from any of them since that day.  It took me until last year to finally realize what a real friend was. It took a lot of trial and error even after that ordeal to figure out the kind of people I wanted to devote my time to. Now being   years after all that Im so happy that I had to go through it because it showed me the kind of life I want to lead and the kind of person I dont want to be. Give them one last chance tell them how they have wronged you and let them know they have the opportunity to prevent you from leaving their life. People who want you around will work for it people who dont want you around arent worth the wasted effort. As for actually finding new friends GFD is a good start .,GFD,d34423a,10,t5_37qo7

Knowing how to defend yourself might be a good confidence booster as well and might just make you feel more secure about yourself and less likely to lash out. I had OCD and always found swimming in highschool kind of helped with stuff like my anxiety. It helped doubleyso when I had one of the best sixpacks in my school and didnt have anything to worry about if I ever appeared shirtless in front of a cute girl at a swimming tournament or PhysEd.
