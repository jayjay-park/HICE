480276,0,t3_1zgz40,I felt uncomfortable. Dont get me wrong it was well written. But the thing is it felt to weird seeing Sally alive dating Aidan and changing almost everything from all the work of the other seasons. I hated that Sally got in the way of Josh changing into a wolf instead of Nora. Josh just let everything that could have been with Nora. Nora was supposed to get cut! Sally didnt know it then but she have to let Nora see Josh change because then she would never understand. It breaks my heart knowing that Nora is most likely going to marry someone else. Sally being alive is what broke Josh and Nora apart. Another thing Aidan was the only one who I saw that changed. I liked it but then I felt like he was being the favorite of the show. Things were going good for him. He had a werewolf girlfriend he seemed sober instead of overdosing on blood every week he wouldnt have killed so many people then and he mostly broke away from his father. But even then so Sally changed him so much that he wasnt the person Josh moved in with and she messes everything up!Im glad she died because I hope now the writers of the show can fix it to bring it back from all those seasons. They should have never did this episode. But since they did the writers should at least make it to One. Where Sally goes back again to stop herself still has all the memories reghostslives everything fixes some things that could have been fixed before and keeps the close friendship. Or Two. Doesnt go back but stays as a ghost fixes everything between Aidan and Josh gets Nora back in the picture and keeps going on.I know that the show is being cancelled but I really dont think this turn on the show can help or make a good ending. Its just.. all those seasons character development and everything were for nothing. ,beinghuman,cfuuzk0,5,t5_2sa3r
