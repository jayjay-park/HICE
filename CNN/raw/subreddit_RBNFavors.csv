484962,0,t3_1zo1yu,I worry about this a lot. I dont understand money at all so even though I have a pretty good job I never ever spend money on anything because Im terrified of messing up somehow and not having anything. Like it took me  minutes to buy a box of candy the other day. My moms not even the N but shes very judgmental and moody about how I spend so I feel like I cant ask her for help even though shes a professional accountant.,RBNFavors,cfve6i3,1,t5_3060j

4940353,0,t1_cugzlml,Thanks  I keep seeing fear being linked to people mostly young moving outbeing kicked out and having to start fending for themselves. If I can make it less scary or give them some tools their Ns wouldnt give them Id really like to. Having to figure out how to cook clean pay bills budget do laundry etc is a big load for someone whos trying to escape a life and people that hurt them. ,RBNFavors,cuh9rf0,2,t5_3060j
