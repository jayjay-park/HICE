5034650,0,t3_3jvwik,Best I can tell is youll have to do what I did. Find a smallish town with a gamecomic shop. The more worn the town the better. My place I like to refer to as the town that time forgot. They had one copy because thats all they keep on hand of anything.  ,legendarymarvel,cusv7ly,2,t5_31dy2

I know its more of a card game but I love components. GotG came with shards. Maybe something to keep track of who the current player is? Counters are always nice to help keep track of things like bystanders victory points or schemes and mastermind stuff.  Heroes. I am always happy with any of the heroes they give us I personally prefer new heroes vs. variants on current heroes. How many more Iron Man Wolverines and Spiderman will we get? I love them all just prefer new characters. Antman Wasp Vision Blink SheHulk Young Avengers Jessica Jones AntiVenom Ash Ketchum War Machine Havok etc...  MultiPart Schemes Stories usually do not end when the Masterminds scheme is foiled... sometimes its fun to keep playing with the same heroes something like if you win play this scheme next  or a part  scheme and a part  scheme. I was hoping that for Secret Wars  Finally... An Official Log Book to keep track of all your games and winsloses. Not important but our group likes to keep a log. ,legendarymarvel,d3mmc94,3,t5_31dy2

9539645,0,t1_d9lir48,While I agree with the points you make I dont necessarily agree with the examples youve given.Regarding the supposed niche characters of the Cap expansion  anybody remotely interested in the MCU knows who Falcon Winter Soldier and Cap are Agent X is the only unknown character from that set. Arnim Zola and Baron Zemo are super popular also.Secret Wars might have less known characters or weird versions of popular characters but it gives fans Beast Captain Britain Agent Venom versions of Cyclops and Jean Grey...so that even the casual fan might enjoy the roster.Fear Itself benefits from solid mechanics and from wellknown adversaries but yes it sufferd a lot because of the playable characters it introduced. this is the only example i aree with. Sabretooth is perhaps the most popular xmen villain to the casual moviegoer after Magneto. ,legendarymarvel,d9oyk5n,1,t5_31dy2

10678088,0,t3_5srwt6,On the game board there are spots to hold the cards that youll acquire throughout the game. Wounds are one also Shield Officers etc. Normally the wound stack hold a bunch of wounds but for Legacy Virus there are a finite amount and when theyre out the players lose. Have you played through the demo game in the instruction manual? Red Skull with the Cosmic Cube scheme? Thats the one I use to introduce new players. ,legendarymarvel,ddhd43w,8,t5_31dy2

11406298,0,t1_dfot13i,This is the right explanation.The order you lay the card down can be VERY important.  When I explain it to people for the first time I use Wolverines deck to demonstrate.Take the exact same three cards.   attack and Yellow ability Draw a card I refer to ability types by the card border color makes it easier.  You can lay all three down but make sure you know that you only get to use the ability twice the first card played does not get an ability bonus because there is no one to help him do that ability...but you always get the attack and star points.  If you do want to use all three Draw a cards play another yellow card like the Wolverine  attack You may KO a Wound from your hand or discard pile if you do Draw a new Card then youd get all the abilities on those three cards.,legendarymarvel,dfow1bb,6,t5_31dy2
11416285,0,t3_62yh2m,I like going in order of when they were released. In my opinion they keep getting progressively stronger and stronger. Both master minds and heroes. So I think if you were to get the new secret wars  for example base game heroes just really struggle against it. So you kinda have to play old vs old and new vs new. But if you buy in order it ramps up slowly allowing you to use your whole collection and still win. That doesnt mean you need every one. I have enjoyed all of them really so I dont think you can go wrong. ,legendarymarvel,dfq0w39,2,t5_31dy2
