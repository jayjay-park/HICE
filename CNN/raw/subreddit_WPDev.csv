88425,0,t3_1v3pue,DVLUP is a great game resource for developers and Ive gotten some pretty great promotions from Nokia from it.But I also found it works best if you like WP programming and use DVLUP as a guide for your workflow rather than a reason to make an app in the first place.As an example I have a WP app. I was going to port it to Windows  eventually. If I can get bonus points Ill port it today instead of tomorrow. But I dont recommend porting an app simply for the  exp.,WPDev,ceohvan,3,t5_2u8fg
604265,0,t1_cg8y9dn,It depends entirely on the game I would imagine its a lot of work as none of them are written in objective c or Java. If you had the android ports source code and aets it would be a lot easier but the devs who ported it would have to give you the codeTo answer your original question no  youre not going to find a blog entry that tells you how to port old games because every game is different ,WPDev,cg8yig5,1,t5_2u8fg

The only new thing is that now you can have the speech recognition system to pass to your app the full recognized text not only the keywords you define on the VCD file. I am having problems right now with one app of mine  the new recognizer do not understand my app name. I would love to know why and what can I do about it but had no success asking here on twitter or msdn forum about it ,WPDev,cgy2dgi,1,t5_2u8fg

And your app may take even longer before its available in all markets.Check out the dev.windows.com forums  someone posts a question about why their app didnt immediately enter the store at least  or  times a day.Microsoft need to do a better job of advising devs of the process.,WPDev,cpzh90d,1,t5_2u8fg

6033354,0,t1_cyabvz9,gt Ok thank you. Just out of curiosity why do you run Windows in Windows? And do you need  licenses?Im one of the developers at Microsoft that makes the emulator  so I need a way to verify functionality in a clean environment.  I dont think we fully support the scenario yet though.If the virtualization software you are using on OSX supports nested VMs then you should give it a try.  Youll want to ensure that the VM has at least  virtual cpus or you can modify an xml file in the XDE folder and you probably wont get audiomicrophone emulation.,WPDev,cyahlph,1,t5_2u8fg

10866346,0,t1_de0qu0t,Did you set the capabilities to access file storage that might be needed?It depends a lot on the installer. If we take the really basic user that doesnt know anything then I would say the Store would be the most intuitive way works well on other Android and iOS  almost everyone knows how to install apps nowadays. When not considering the store well you cant add desktop icons with the app installer or launch the app after installing it so the users need to open the start menu and find the app in the list.You can use the desktop app converter to add Windows  features Live Tiles Notifications new APIs ... to a WPF app and to package it in an Appx.Yes the user base is limited to the anniversary edition thats true. But I think support for lower versions will end soon not  sure about when.In my opinion UWP is the future and if it has all the necessary APIs for your app then I would go for it. If you still want to support older versions of Windows then there is no other way but WPF. But if you separate the GUI well from the application logic you could start with WPF and once you are done with that add a UWP version that shares some of the code sure its more than just the GUI that changes theres also the different APIs but its easier to port then  or the other way around.,WPDev,de0sbm4,1,t5_2u8fg
