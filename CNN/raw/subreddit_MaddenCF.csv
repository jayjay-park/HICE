2329182,0,t3_2lyqln,So then do you play the games or just run sims through Madden or both?We play the games. There are leagues that do pure simulation but typically when you see Sim League it means you are trying to get as close to a realistic experience as Madden will allow. At the end of our games we want the final score and stats reflect what you might see on Sunday and not look like you clearly just played a video game with crazy numbers.In most cases this means emphasis is put on houserules to ensure the game between two users doesnt devolve into a HeadtoHeadUnranked game that you world normally see against a random opponent online where there is complete disregard for conventional football strategies and often times just comes down to who can abuse the same handful of formationsplays better than the other. For example here is an excerpt from our rules page gt Cheesy Playgt  gt  Cheesy play will be defined more specifically as we get further into Madden .  For now you are expected to use more than one play and more than the same route repeatedly offense.  While there will be no rule against running the same defense on every play you should be aware that an offense may try to take advantage of a  play defense in a way that might become repetitive and could lead to a dispute.  For that reason it is advisable that you mix up your plays on defense as well. The one firm rule regarding defensive playcall consistency is to refrain from blitzing every play or close to every play. Would you say its like playing fantasy sports?Its like fantasy sports in that its an interactive online competition and both share obvious teambuilding aspects. If you wanted to liken it to specific fantasy formats I would say sim leagues are comparable to dynasty formats with auction elements when you get to free agency in the offseason. The goal is not just winning in the shortterm but that its also sustainable over the course of multiple seasons.The biggest difference in my opinion is whereas fantasy sports rewards the player for how well they can anticipate the outcomes of certain matchups and configure their lineup a sim leaguemadden it still ultimately comes down to your skill level and how well you perform in the game itself.Some links for your consideration .   Where all the game amp player statsteam recordsstandings are stored..   Rule page fleshes out the league rules a bit more and what it means to be sim.,MaddenCF,clzllrc,5,t5_2y1z6
