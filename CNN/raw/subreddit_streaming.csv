5852266,0,t3_3v105x,. Connect Twitch to Twitter. Make a Twitter post everytime at the same time about  hours before you start and again   mins before.. Stream same time every week with at least  preferably  set days.. Look at the list of streamers at the times you want to do it. Try pick either a game or a time where there isnt a flood of streamers to the point you have to scroll down a few times or more just to see yours. Connect with other streamers. Support each other or find network of streamers you share common games or interests with.. Chat to yourself like someone is watching all the time. People might only stay mins and if seem disinterested in connecting with people even without knowing they are there they might not hang around.. Be prepared to play a game that isnt out yet. Look for alphabeta sign ups and be one of the first to stream it.. NEVER GIVE UP. Without a promo boost from another established streamer you could get more people tomorrow or  months from now. You should be doing it because you want to share your experience and not be popular. It will either happen or it wont. Never think its because people dont like you or your stream. There is a lot of viewers out there and what one person likes  others might not.From my experience being around streamers and watching some fall away and some make it with a few in between. It just takes commitment to yourself and the future viewers. Everything else is luck of the draw. The only time I have seen people launch fast when I say fast I mean in less then a year is when they got a boost from a fellow streamer or streamer group. The only other way when a game first comes out that you know will be popular like a new Blizzard game similar to Heroes of the Storm you play the hell out of it and promote it while never saying anything bad. Once again though this is luck of the draw but its a level field where you could be the person a couple people start watching then more and more. If it doesnt work that time look for the next title. Search for alphabeta sign ups check that you can stream them or be ready to stream the moment they allow it. First in the door means first at the front.,streaming,cxmrdkf,1,t5_2qtbr
7185325,0,t1_d1uujb6,No problem. I stream to twitch using a Linux laptop and nginx to take the load off my pc an the quality is great. I understand what you mean. Im sure there could be some coding for controlling certain push commands with nginx but Im not that intelligent lol.Could this be a possibility? Hope this helps.,streaming,d1uwqdk,1,t5_2qtbr
