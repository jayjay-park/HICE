Yessss I would listen to them they sound like theyd be pretty interesting. o plus your voice and giggles are amazing yassss You dont have to do anything fancy especially if theyre your first vlogs. D You can just walk around with your camera recording a selfie video and talking about random things! Or stay at home and talk about random things... eventually youll figure out what works well and what doesnt and in the meantime people can enjoy your lovely rambles and general adorableness.  Also that guy seems  interesting I might subscribe after all.  My favorite vlogger is probably Casey Neistat hes got some pretty inspirational videos too D Ahh well at least she wasnt secretly planning anything. D Did you ever figure out what was so funny about that word? D Ooh I see. And shhh just let the KPop wave wash over you D Also its been years since Ive spent any money on KPop streaming video and audio means I can get my fix on the cheap. ,NingasKugon,dfphqrj,2,t5_3jedl
