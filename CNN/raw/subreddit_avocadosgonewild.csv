8145878,0,t1_d4vro72,Ya np.  So what you see is the suggested way to germinate avocados.  Im just dicking around with solutions for science.  But basically what you do is. Stick  toothpicks in the pit so as to suspend it in a cup rounded edge down pointed end up.  Fill the glass with enough water to cover the bottom inch of the pit..  Once the shoot reaches   inches cut it back to  inches..  Once the shoot reaches   inches again replant in soil in the same manner as it was in the glass of water.  i.e. bottom half in soil top half in air.I havent looked into it further than that besides seeing that it can take up to  weeks for germination and several years to produce fruit.Edit  Im sure you know all this since youve thought about growing your own tree but I put this for the benefit of anyone else who may come across this post asking questions.  Good luck!,avocadosgonewild,d4vs4ut,4,t5_2vquk
