6841238,0,t1_d0qfi8s,Pretty sure you are mistaken I believe the problem this user has is skype is using his sound card as a sound source instead of the mic causing all system sounds and sounds played through the system to be sent over skype. ,skype,d0rrco4,1,t5_2rbtq

7538521,0,t3_4ictb2,Yea... you want be able to talk though. You want to set your input to an output from windows... Now windows doesnt let you do this anymore so you need to jump your input.The simplest jump is to use  to  cord that goes from the sound output right back into the mic jack.Another way is to have something in between. I output my pc sound to a stereo. i could easily take a stereo out and pipe it back to the mic jack...Hope that makes sense.,skype,d2z3d38,1,t5_2rbtq
7560428,0,t1_d31e7nd,Well for exemple lets say you add a skype contact it will be added to the skype desktop local database.Lets say now you delete that contact on skype web it will STILL be there on skype desktop you can hide the conversation but the contact will forever be in the DB unless you reinstall skype.Thats the kind of crap that makes skype so unreliable.Also while on paper they are part of MS they hardly are in fact.Why do they still use their skype account instead of MSA ? Why is it the only MS service where two factor auth cant be activated ? Skype guys run themselves with their own separate rules totally different from the rest of Microsoft. ,skype,d31l1jt,1,t5_2rbtq
