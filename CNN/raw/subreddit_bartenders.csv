13026,0,t3_1u97mz,Be sure to check  often.  Craigslist is full of scummy jobs.  The cocktail world can be hard to break into in Portland.  Ive lived here for a few years and the nice cocktail places tend to be staffed by different members of the bartender cadre.  Everyone knows each other so if you hang around in those circles youll hear news about where staffing is needed.  If you have a local hangout that doesnt seem out of your league become a regular there.  Dont ever get wasted or be an irritating customer always tip well and dont ask about a job until you are well known.  Thats how Ive gotten about half of my jobs in the bar industry.  Also depending on what kind of schedule you have going to really nice craft bars teardrop kask rum club expatriate early in the evening  pm can be a good time to get the ear of a bartender or ask them about the craft.  Dont be discouraged by the season.  You only need to be successful once to get a job.Hope this helps!  Good luck.,bartenders,cefx18k,5,t5_2smw0

387969,0,t1_cfdgmzh,Our situation is truly unique.  Were a marquee cocktail bar.  Although were in a smaller city we hit capacity every night that we unlock the door. The average drink that I make takes between  and  minutes.Our bar working under any other concept I would be militantly against splitting my tips.  However there are situations that call for it.  Our servers are essentially cocktail servers albeit much more knowledge is required.  That said it still takes me much longer to create a menu cocktail than it takes one of our servers to explain it.  Most of our servers have around  years of experience while among the  bartenders we have  years of experience.  Im the newbie with just  years behind the bar.  Edit My last gig I didnt split tips and averaged about usd a night.  Ive earned my chops and I know I can work any bar out there.  I make much less money at the current gig but its so much more rewarding.,bartenders,cfkz8pt,1,t5_2smw0
426992,0,t3_1yxhu7,I started out as a bartender in a high end restaurant serving well crafted cocktails I was alright. Now I am mostly a craft beer specialist. I like beer more so I do it better and I consume the products often so I have an intimate knowledge of them unlike at some places where I would operate on my knowledge of what one of my co workers thought of a wine we had or what the back of the label said about the nuances of what ever scotch.  Personally I dont feel like I am a great bartender I fuck up a lot and beat myself up about it but I find that most of my contemporaries seem to not even care or dont look to improve themselves in the field of bartending so I guess that puts me at a better than average level. When I see truly masterful tending either in drinks making knowledge of product or dealing with customers I admire it and then stow it away in my brain in hopes of using it my self. I dont put much stock in sales as an indicator of worthiness unless it changes dramatically for a prolonged period. Someone took over a shift I had worked for a few years and the sales average dropped by about  over  months. Turns out she would leave the bar to take prolonged smoke breaks ish min and customers didnt like it so they left before they normally would and then eventually stopped coming in as much. That I would say is an indicator but week to week fluctuations isnt worth thinking much about. Tip percentage is also something that should be averaged over a period of time as opposed to night to night. I worked at a craft beer place for a while that had one bartender and one server with no kitchen. The server would work  tables with about  guests and I would work the bar with  seats and a sizable bottle shop along with pouring most every beer that would go out. After a few months I noticed that my tips were on average  of sales while the servers were about  of sales. The servers blamed it on all kinds of things but they were all things that I also had to deal with customer wise. Sure enough what I deduced it to was that the customer could see me moving around and hustling where as the server would put in an order into the POS and then sit there until they figured I had poured the beer. So I invited them to pour their own beer and tip averages went up out on the floor. No one wants to see their server or bartender just chillin out on the floor. ,bartenders,cfp0u5t,2,t5_2smw0

SHE is the swweetest attractive and has complemented me on my Lemon Drop in the past openly telling me I make the best shes ever had at which my spideysense indicated that an immediate although minimal resentment was triggered in her husband.  He says he wants a peppermint patty.  I was not intimately familiar with the drink so I googled it on my phone and several website recipes all came back with it as a mixed drink made with light andor dark cream de cocoa white creme de menthe andor peppermint schnapps  and cream on the rocks.  So I improvised a little but essentially made a white chocolate mint drink on the rocks.   He completely bitches me out saying its freezing outside and hes cold pooooor fuckin baby that he was a bartender  years ago and that this drink should be Rumplemintz and hot chocolate WTF !!!.  I dont even carry Rumplemintz but WHATEVER !!    So I took the cocktail away and returned with a hot chocolate with white creme de menthe and  proof Absolut vodka topped with whipped cream dusted with cocoa powder.  Fucker.  All the while I was redelivering and serving it to him I was flirting with his wife albeit very subtly smiling eye contact even an eye wink.  Anyway they went into the restaurant without paying whit him just ASSUMING I would transfer their bar tab to the server which I had no alternative but to do. As the time passed another Peppermint Patty came in on the servers ticket which I knew was for him and so made it the hot chocolate method again along with a few glasses of wine for their dinner. On their way out for the night they passed back through the lounge and the guy palmed me a  and said thanks for taking care of us. WTF.  Some people.,bartenders,cfz5b8w,0,t5_2smw0

862202,0,t3_2403ok,Honestly your biggest weakness is the lack of bar experience. Anyone can go to bartending school or take a course and in my experience some managers actually look DOWN upon those that do so the only explanation they gave me was that it makes them THINK they know what theyre doing and usually teaches them the wrong way. Basically they dont want to have to retrain you.. I know this isnt the advice you want to hear but if youre applied for  different gigs without even a hint of success you need to alter what youre doing. Apply somewhere as a barback at least make friends with the bartenders and have them help you learn during slow time. Thats the kind of things that will give you a shot when applying for a bartending gig.Another thing to keep in mind is that theres hardly a shortage of qualified bartenders as its a very wellcompensated rewarding career. When there are openings usually they get filled due to recommendations from managementcurrent bartenders so another point against you if youre brand new to the industry. Like I said stay where youre at and work your way up or try to get a gig barbacking somewhere.Good luck!,bartenders,ch2ades,4,t5_2smw0

All the managers and bar supervisors and fellow bartenders who you really want on your side?  They go to those shitholes for drinks after work.  The most beautiful thing about this industry is that at the end of the day its a meritocracy.  Do a good enough job and stay humble and work your ass off in the position youre given and youll be brought up in no time.  Look at that other post about that kid who went from dishwasher to bartender.  Look at that kids attitude!  Any bar manager would kill to have a kid like that on staff because hes humble and eager to learn and eager to do a damn good job with whatever job is given to him.You have no experience.  You have certifications but those dont mean shit if you cant stand across the bar from a customer on hour nine of a dead monday shift and serve him with a smile and good attitude.  Are you clean and efficient do you build regulars can you make your team bigger than the sum of its parts?  Is there a guy who is just as eager as you are who has experience working in shitholes isnt going to bounce for their career in a year and can dedicate themselves full time to the job?I dunno man.  Everyone wants to be a bartender but no one wants to be a bartender. At least in the US bartending is a pretty competitive job and youve got to be better than the next guy.

2309578,0,t3_2lqcxq,Honestly as a bar manager I would be really pissed that I hired a staff member with poor judgement. And that would feed into the text you got. Its one thing for them to ask you to pay them back its another for them to grapple with the fact that a member of their staff put his coat in the dumbest place ever and was too oblivious of a situation to stop it before it happened. Good staff are defined by their common sense which these days is not that common. I am sure they are considering cutting their losses and letting you go because you did a really stupid thing and now they are wondering what else you did or will do because you werent paying attention. A well picked and well educated staff member would never do what you did. Im sorry if this sounds harsh. But its true. I am sure they are rethinking your worth to the venue. And rightly so. Dont get prissy about being taken off the shift. If you think you can find another job or prove that you are earnest about paying them back and do your best to show them that this will never ever fucking ever happen again. I broke a bottle my first day. Never again except for the failure of a Smirnoff box bottom on a very rainy weekend and I only lost one bottle.  Breakage is profit. You didnt break  you lost them . Of course they can replace the bottle. But they can just as easily replace you too.

Its important to have your bartenders enthusiastic about at least a couple of those things otherwise they dont upsell it well. Make them different but intelligible.

3701417,0,t3_32pdlq,It is annoying to me because my bar uses smashed ice that comes out if a machine in great chunks. A lot of bars are the same. So this means we dont actually have cubes. When asked I will do my best to give you whatever looks about right to being  cubes but it wont be consistent if you ask again.Also something you need to know about is the misconception that adding more ice to a drunk waters it down more. This is not true and the opposite is actually the case.If you put just three small pieces of ice in a glass of liquid they will melt completely into the drink and water it down much faster and then fail to keep the drink cool because all the ice melted.If you completely fill the glass with ice before adding the liquid mix there is much more surface area of ice in contact with the drink so it keeps it much cooler allowing the ice to stay frozen much longer and melt slower therefore not watering down the drink. It pisses me off when people ask for no ice or not much ice when they order mixers because I know its going to be gross and warm in no time. If youre ordering a nice scotch on its own then I have no problem giving you the right amount off ice you like because thats an acceptable way to enjoy it.,bartenders,cqe6pnm,3,t5_2smw0

4098033,0,t3_37ho4n,I worked many years at a bowlingentertainmentrestaurant venue. You will run the gamut of clientele depending on where you are. First of all card anyone without grey hair and scrutinize IDs. Protect yourself. Bent out of shape license or out of state? Have a manager check it so its not on your head. Kids. SO MANY KIDS!  Glasses of water and shirley temples will keep you occupied for weekend bdays. Chat up the parents and get them to hang with you while the kiddos have fun. Birthday child? Ask if you can get them a dessert on the house. Make that money flow. Be ready for huge rushes out of nowhere. We didnt make a reservation but theres about   of us coming in. Can we push some tables together and order through the bar? Usually good tips but youre going to earn every penny. Judge how busy you are or WILL be and determine if you can take care of them or hand them off to a server. Keep track of your tabs and GET A CARD ON FILE if you can!!  A bowling alley is a big place and people wander. After a few drinks they forget  if theyve paid their tab or not or if they had a tab with you or the lane server. Ive been waiting  minutes for a server on lane X!!! Youll get this a lot. Best response is Oh man Im sorry about that. If yall need drinks just come to the source!  If they need complicated food and drink orders casually mention I can get that order for you but I cant give you the best service on your lane from behind the bar.

4957824,0,t3_3it9wr,Welcome to my hell for years. I was a hugely introverted person still am but I am able to break out of my shell and show myself as an extrovert when I need to. Most people dont know this until they see me somewhere other than work. I surprised a lot of people when I told them I was an introvert and most didnt believe me. Its a rough life but let me give you some tips that helped me. take an acting class. Community college local whatever just take one. They are loads of fun and the entire thing is designed to bring you out of your shell. Even if you hate it you will realize that it made you that much more comfortable with the ridiculous. get a book of jokes. Or watch stand up comedy. Dont memorize jokes or one liners or anything just start soaking it up. Youll begin to have funny things to add about a range of topics. You can be part of the conversation with people and you can have something to add without having to go out of your way and be totally there . get books that answer crazy questions or just read TIL religiously comments article and all. Some good book titles to get you startedDo fish drink waterUnderground historyLies my teacher told meThe New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge a great reference to have anyways!my final and most important bit of advice and this one is really the only thing that helps Fake it until you make it. Seriously thats it. You are the bartender now. You are the coolest most important person in the entire bar restaurant because you are the guy people get alcohol from. Managers can but it is your specific job to do so and dont let yourself forget it. Dont become a dick about it just realize people want to be around you. I wish you luck and as a fellow introvert I do not envy the road you have before you. You will be uncomfortable and worn down. When you get home from a shift I recommend reading or watching a movie to wind down. Decompress and dont forget how important that can be for introverts. If you ever need someone to talk to or just had a shit experience at work and need to vent pm me. I would be happy to help. That goes for any introverted bartenders reading this as well. a final tip if you absolutely need it create a persona.

7129020,0,t1_d1of0jv,I know where youre coming fromI wanted to tend bar from the moment I entered the service industry when I was . I tried to get someone to give me a shot. I got the certificates. It didnt work. The thing about certifications is that they are basically designed as a form of insurance for the bar. I dont live in Florida but I have the equivalent license in my state. I have that certificate in case something god forbid should happen. Those certifications are designed so that you take the laws regarding alcohol seriouslythey offer next to nothing in terms of skill. Im going to offer you some unsolicited advice because I think that people who want to be in this industry shouldnt be discouraged from it. Go ahead and get your license. Learn as much about drink making as you can there are resources at your disposal on the internet but nothing can take the place of experience. When you go to apply under the positions applying for put Cocktail WaitressServer Barback or Bartender. If you go in for an interview the employer will probably tell you that it requires experience to get behind the bar. You should tell them I understand that but I wanted to include that on my application because that is my end goal in this industry. I am willing to work in whatever position is available but my primary interest is furthering my skills and gain experience so that I can get behind the bar in the future. Then if you get the job your employer will already know that youre interested and if you work your ass off it will probably pay off for you.Alternatively you can do what I didif you cant get in a  bar try to get on in a restaurant that has a preferably busy full service bar. Do the same thing application and interviewwise and start as a server. Restaurants in my experience have a much higher turnover rate than bars so youll be able to move up the ladder a little faster. They also tend to be more lenient in regards to age. If you can get behind the bar at a restaurant then when you go to look for a bar gig you can say youre experienced. I did restaurant bartending for about  years and when one of the busiest spots in my town had an opening they asked me to apply. That was my first  bar gig. Its a whole different world than restaurant tending but without those years in restaurants I wouldnt have been able to land the job I have now.I wish you all the best!Edit to add If you get in anywhere as a serverbarback try your damndest to be helpful. Dont kiss anyones ass but if your bartenders are in the weeds ask if you can help them my servers sometimes wash dishes change kegs cut extra fruit...etc. I dont have a barback.

Once you have learned everything about those white wines and youve tasted them all and you know how to talk about them and pair them move on to reds. Repeat. Do this with all of your beer and all of your spirits. Study vodkas for a while then gin then bourbon then scotch. As you study spirits try learning some classic cocktails made with each one. I will also say that a large part of being successful in any field is confidence and comfort. Stop thinking of your restaurant as fancy. Sure it may be a higher end restaurant in comparison to others in your area but it is YOUR restaurant.  Im assuming youre not barbacking in a Michelin starred restaurant here.  think of your place as the norm.  The style of service needs to be genuine but comfortable. Own it and bring yourself to it. Also learn about these things on a broad scale. If your beer changes that frequently you need to study beer in general. If someone asks what an IPA is you should be able to tell them. Moreover if someone asks what the difference between your IPA your session IPA and your double IPA is you should be able to tell them in clear simple terms that someone less knowledgable will understand. Drink.   Go to bars and meet bartenders ask them what theyre excited about. Ask questions but dont be obnoxious. Theyre working.  People that sell bicycles know a lot about bicycles because they ride them as well as sell them.  Good bartenders are often drinkers. Hopefully not in excess but if you go to a new cocktail bar in town for gods sake dont order a coors. Order something you can learn about.,bartenders,d22jlw5,3,t5_2smw0

Will cost the bar or probably you  or so upfront but that is something a little extra you can do without having to convincing anyone for budget increases.Lime and lemon wheels as mentioned look pretty good when dehydrated. Similarly orange and grapefruits work. But have a play around with random things. Pineapple rings with the skin still on look incredible if a little chewy.Also blow torch costs literally less than  online. You can caramelize all kinds of fruits in sugar I recommend demerara and use them as garnishes.

This is important because the techniques you learn will transform you from somebody who is capable of mixing correctly measured ingredients to a bartender who crafts with purpose.

First of all understand the concept of the bar what kind of bar do you want it to be and how does it cooperate with the restaurant where your bar will be placed. Secondly understand the market what type of guests are you expecting to be sitting at your bar.These are two kind of things you need to take in consideration when setting up a bar menu. Furthermore what kind of people can you afford to hire.  Professional bartenders? Experienced bar backs? Or will you be primarily training them as well?.Also understand the culture  to get better and quicker deliveries and discounts if you deal under the table.  i worked in a bar in Vietnam where more money was dealt under the table then on black and white but it did make our life alot better Theres alot more i could post but then this would turn into a  multiple paged essay. ,bartenders,d7jkahw,2,t5_2smw0

11387952,0,t3_62cw9b,I can relate. Its exhausting to have a job where you have to appear happy and actively make people happy all the time. And underneath you know it really isnt legitimately making anyone a better person most of them are bottling their issues and youre the enabler. So when you go home after keeping the energy up on a long shift its hard to have anything left over. If youre like me and keep things professional at work never letting coworkers or patrons know if youre having a bad day all that negativity that built up spills over in the only time you get alone or with your SO. I feel like two different people at work and at home. At work Im forcefully outgoing optimistic and charismatic. At home I snap over little things because all my energy is gone.,bartenders,dfmt06q,2,t5_2smw0

11698071,0,t1_dglsuvi,You have rights under the FLSA.  With a little work you can probably find an attorney who will represent you on contingency.  You have two to three years depending on the situation to sue.  As I see it its not really about recovering my money.  Rather its about preventing them from screwing other lowwage workers over.  In short I aim to put an end to their illegal payment practices.,bartenders,dglztp5,5,t5_2smw0

11739486,0,t1_dgqoibk,I just said that through different locales that techniques vary. Thus contradicting sources. But this can be explained by different bars different subcultures within the profession at the time. None of them are wrong per se it just depends on where you were. Now that we have a global network were beginning to see standardization.Something like fingers though is an antiquated and no longer used term outside of people just attempting to be annoying for the most part. Giving a hard definition for it is fairly impossible. Its just an eyeballed freepour of a flexible amount of liquor within certain confines.,bartenders,dgqp8gh,3,t5_2smw0
