5669784,0,t3_3srblt,I have preferred BC into IBG I really like getting that early  CDR and the slow field combined with the low CD of w just makes it all that much easier to get more passive hits. And the extra mana helps during those extended fights. From there I go Visage into Dead Mans Plate.,Illaoi,cwzw4vz,1,t5_3afkz
6996272,0,t3_4bh8gr,Considering that ZZ is being patched this week to have only  HP think like a pink ward I think what youve found will probably be shortlived. The item still provides great stats but the portal will be much easier to kill. Combine that with Illaois inability to roam building tank stats first over damage doesnt make you a huge threat early and a smart enemy team will look to snowball the side lanes andor constantly take dragsheralds. Its a nice niche pick that might take a few opponents offguard but its easily countered and would be hard to pull off at higher elos. But hey if its working for you now I wont tell you to stop. Keep on doing your thing and finding ways to win with Illaoi. ,Illaoi,d19dcpu,1,t5_3afkz
7177130,0,t1_d1tymjv,Ive said this a lot over the few days of trying to teach people to play Illaoi so Im sorry if youother people are getting bored of this answer. Build mana items build SheenGauntlet and abuse the fuck out of him with your WGrasp. If he spirit fire you when you try to Vessel him you can still in most cases kill his spirit before he cancel it if its under a tentacle especially when he starts having less health because of your harass.Nasus is a ticking bomb at some point you just cant kill him anymore but with Illaoi he needs upwards of  or  stacks to even get close to being able to solo you Considering you are both equally farmeditemized so you got plenty of time. What I usually do is to abuse GraspW on him from the start but dont commit to anything. First back I buy Sheen  bootsruby crystal since you need the mana to poke him low with Q and the Sheen to abuse WGrasp even harder. At some point you got him poked down pretty low while also pushing the lane so hes sitting under his turret doing the classic Nasus thing of trying to stay in lane with his lifesteal and Qing the minions he can get. But at this point you should just flat out dive him theres no way a  Nasus which ults will survive you sitting at full HP diving him with at least  tentacles on him. He either have to flash and youll do it again when your ult is back up or hell die. In both cases youre winning and will get more farm than him to the point where the match up is just easier. I had problems with Nasus the first few times I played Illaoi versus him because I didnt go for Gauntlet early I simply didnt have the mana so I would poke him low but wouldnt be able to finish the job and I would sit without mana and farm and he would just farm my tentacles with Q when I finally made him a vessel but then I started going Gauntlet first item against match ups which require heavy poke or which do physical damage and really all Illaoi needs is mana in lane and she can sustain off that and keep on harassing them. The problem is she needs all  of her abilities to harass people which is going to cost a lot of mana. Her Q scales well with AD items but it also got a pretty decent base damage so does W with SheenGauntletGrasp and even E is decent without any extra AD as long as its getting leveled second.The only thing which is annyoing is when his Wither starts fucking up your W when youre spamming it during ult but it shouldnt be gamebreaking.Playing against Nasus is a very nice way of learning how to play Illaoi in lane since you need to win lane against him since you know hes going to scale infinitely while youre not but that is also going to learn you how to win lane by harassing opponents to the point where you are starving them from CSing. Because if you pick Illaoi and go even in lane you most likely lost the top match up. Illaoi needs to shut downkill the top laner to be a decent pick otherwise you couldve picked most other top laners which got a better overall impact on the game. To put it simply you pick Illaoi to completely trash top lane draw aggro to your lane and get out ahead or to give your team space to take objectivesfarm. She is not a good late game champion even though if  people stay in your ult she is,Illaoi,d1tz307,2,t5_3afkz
7489754,0,t3_4hvt2p,Shes way better top because top is as far away from early game objectives as you can get you want to draw people away from objectives and force them to rotate on you to stop you from killing their top laner or taking his towers. As a mid laner youre supposed to roam a good bit and join the early dragon fights and youre absolutely terrible at chasing and roaming and you need the levelsfarm to do well on her.Shes only really good against meleeassasins in the mid lane. Any equally skilled AP mage mid will destroy you and roam around.,Illaoi,d2tjm9o,1,t5_3afkz

8673081,0,t1_d6phv1k,Being able to deal  damage to a target with  of their health as guaranteed damage is a strong antidive tool. More so than what Q can offer. There is quite a lot of champions that can avoid the ultimate few that can avoid the E as well!  Current Health is also strong even when people are at  health. Thats because the  ratio is so high. Doesnt matter if it cant kill people you actually have your other spells to do that! For example  of HP  dmg Qs or dmg Qs it doesnt make a difference if the target is at hp! What matters is that you get them low in the first place. By slowly chunking them with Qs over the course of minutes or a single E current HP each time at a s CD. Which is why I prefer E over Q.,Illaoi,d6pr9au,1,t5_3afkz
8717963,0,t3_4zedzh,Skills E and Q max are currently . apart so its just reaffirming that Q and E max are both very close in win rate.Build Order Sample size is really important when it comes down to builds. The build you listed has the lowest pick rate games. This also should be said that since these builds are limited to three items the builds with the most damage are almost always a higher win rate BC  Steraks  DD and BC  DD  Steraks are within . of the higheset win rate Also the more expensive the first three items the higher the win rate due to games generally ending earlier.Boots Currently showing boots of swiftness as the top pick... boots are definitely situational so this statistic isnt really important imo.Masteries DFT SRS and Grasp all appear to be within . winrate so all seem viable.,Illaoi,d6vdv1j,1,t5_3afkz

10440104,0,t3_5piir3,. I take Fervor of Battle when laning against tanks and other champions that are weak in the laning phase and max Q. The extra AD it gives you scales all your abilities and really helps you snowball the lane and it overall will do more damage than Deathfire Touch. I take Grasp of the Undying against really tough melee laners for the sustain and still max Q for waveclear and farming. Pretty selfexplanatory. And sometimes I take Stormraiders Surge against ranged top laners that want to kite me and max E. One good E should get the SRS proc which will help a lot with chasing them down or running away.. Illaoi needs some damage and some tank. I rush Black Cleaver against tanks or tough lanes or Trinity Force against squishies and pushovers. If Im even following that is Steraks Gage then Deaths Dance then tank items like Spirit Visage and Deadmans Plate or Randuins Omen. If Im ahead I might get Deaths Dance before Steraks and if Im behind Ill get a tank item before Steraks. I also sometimes substitute Deaths Dance for Maw of Malmortius if the enemy is heavy on magic damage.. I know you didnt ask for this but its important You are weak pre and extremely weak pre. The focus until you have your ultimate should be staying safe outfarming your opponent and landing that crucial E harass only when its convenient i.e. you have at least one tentacle around. If you spam your abilities by trying to trade all the time you will run out of mana and get killed. Once you are  bait your opponent into an allin and crush them with that tasty deceptively bursty ER combo.,Illaoi,dcrgnn6,0,t5_3afkz

The trick is to abuse her when shes coming in for her aa passive.  Without it shes just wave clear and with it shes outtraded in health. A lot of that knowledge came from customs but in the times Ive gone against lux Ive stomped them pretty handedly.As for fizz his mobility and dot forces a q max over an e max and forces you to focus him over his spirit and his ult hitbox is stupid.Ive been meaning to take her top as well as her scaling ad reds but I get lonely up there and end up overextending and dying and I dont play enough each day to yield enough Influence points to support my other weird things like gold galio or glass canon mpen kog maw mage.,Illaoi,ddle5e3,1,t5_3afkz
10801314,0,t3_5ufeq1,Another important one is ult flashing to reduce enemy reaction time.There is also the very situational e flash that will move the vessel to the location of the flash,Illaoi,ddu2uvd,1,t5_3afkz

10851222,0,t3_5v3lpl,So one thing that helps against her e is boots suited against her team but if you happen to get ed and dont have an advantage i.e. Numbers vs her no ult the best thing is often to use your dredgeline to get away and suffer for a few seconds which you have to deal with in a certain way.To deal with a e debuff get away from illaoi pref under tower such that it spawns close to the center of the lane on the turret and let the first tentacle swing dodging it. DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM IT OR KILL IT. The spawn mechanic makes more tentacles and thus more swings. Instead take it to ONE HP so if illaoi engages you can quickly dispatch of it. At later levels youll need to dodge the first and second swing and if she ults just run home use flash use line just dont let her snowball. Furthermore Good illaoi know how to ultflash so dont go feeling safe with  hp. If she lands an e she can shift her ult enough to deal the ult damage to you plus an additional . In which case youll spawn tentacles and go to Japan.Naut isnt really the best to win lane per se but if you just dont give up too much and get help at moments of weakness youll have an easier time locking her to a location away from the frontline. Wont do much good against her ult though. If she sees your stuns coming she can ult and do the animation as shes stunned. ,Illaoi,ddz867u,1,t5_3afkz

If nobody has any armor that means nobody can tank the damage and stay healthy. If you get hit by the barons autos you do reduced damage to the baron so you really dont want to be switching the person tanking. You need strong vision control but that takes time and teamwork.

11663128,0,t1_dghzc7s,hey there barcifc  I appreciate other comments in the thread.  Not OP here but I wanted to give some feedback.  Generally building Crit on Illaoi is not good  primarily because auto attacks are a very minor part of our overall damage build.  We get a lot of our damage from our abilities  which scale with AD.  So while Infinity Edge is great on an auto attacking ADC  its very poor on Illaoi.  You mention Titanic Hydra as well.  This is also a sub optimal Illaoi item.  Usually you build a hydra item on champions with waveclear problems.  Your Fiora Camille Trundle types.  Illaoi has no problems with waveclear because of Q and W proccing tentacles.  While not a bad item  its just not needed here.  Bloodthirster isnt picked much because of the same reason crit isnt good  it only really procs on autoattacks unlike deaths dance which also procs on abilities.  Finally LDR  This can be situationally good.  But generally we get enough armor shredding power from Black Cleaver.  If we do buy a last whisper item  its usually Mortal Reminder  and thats more for the killing of health regen abilities then the armor shred.  I posted a list of good items on illaoi above.  If you have questions why those items are picked or need more detail why the items I listed above shouldnt be  feel free to ask.  ,Illaoi,dgi13x8,3,t5_3afkz
