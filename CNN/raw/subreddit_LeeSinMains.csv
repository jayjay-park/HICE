9547919,0,t3_5bklsf,practise makes perfect.Im for real. go into a custom game find someone who wants to idle with much armor and just practise practise practise. Q on them and immediately ward jump behind him.Do that over and over again. Goodluck ,LeeSinMains,d9pz7sm,1,t5_3308a
9573744,0,t3_5c2qj5,i dont know the specific question youre asking about grading but i know what helped me get mastery  lee sin. i didnt recieve mastery  lee until about k. why? because of the playstyle i set for myself. i would always go into a tanky peel style of build. the best way i know that you get get mastery  lee is to go primarily full ad with maybe a GA thrown in. you need to get fed and carry. its a very fun playstyle but super risky.,LeeSinMains,d9t5qw3,2,t5_3308a

With a  healthy dose of KS with Q it can be incredibly easy to get S grades jg is a really difficult role to get an S on. AD mid lee is the second best again only in regards to S grades. ,LeeSinMains,d9v0gcr,1,t5_3308a

11243098,0,t1_df6b66z, seconds the flash kick was not needed. Mundo didt pose much of a threat and your ultQ seemed to finish her off. seconds The ward hop then taking your Q seemed unnecessary. Naut already qd and autod you while your Q was already on ezreal. I understand why you flash kicked diana but because you did instead of just kicking her through the team or waiting for the cage to go down then insecing her and flashing out she escaped. Kicking her through the team may have also given your team time to catch up. So maybe not a lot of unnecessary but a few  IMO. I am by no means the best Lee Sin so maybe I am wrong. A lot of plays also kinda depended on if you took anything out of it. Generally using my flash for a kill midlate is only worth it if you can take an objective otherwise I am down a flash that could help in the next team fight.I love the smiteQ combos,LeeSinMains,df6dzy7,1,t5_3308a
