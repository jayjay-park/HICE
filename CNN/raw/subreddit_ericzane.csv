7173165,0,t3_4dqo2s,Well I know who to go to if my wife divorces me and I also know how to more accurately measure my BMI and how often to walk at work! I learned a lot today! Just not enough about Zanes departure.,ericzane,d1tis4e,3,t5_3cknj
7173849,1,t1_d1tkmbr,They wont address it theyre cowards.,ericzane,d1tll73,1,t5_3cknj
7185535,0,t1_d1uv898,Both. Just go to the  minute segment.,ericzane,d1uxlfz,1,t5_3cknj
7203154,0,t3_4e3omp,Really hope Zane or Kyle sees this. I too think they need to get callers involved in the show with games.,ericzane,d1wxw50,3,t5_3cknj
7223924,0,t1_d1zaxm7,Thanks but I cant install software on my work computer.  Im able to get the mp through my convoluted method but thought there might be an easier way.,ericzane,d1zb12n,1,t5_3cknj
7239505,0,t1_d211ibk,Maybe but seems pretty dumb to me. But thats just me so,ericzane,d212uq6,0,t5_3cknj
7320093,0,t3_4fje3o,He makes it sound like they have been working together for a decade!  Monday i was nervous i gotta admit.  But I was almost instantly won over with how he complimented Zanes commentary and expanded on his points.  He did a helluva job of adding to the conversation when needed and staying quiet and letting Zane do his thing when he needed to as well which personally I think is the hardest thing to master.Honestly I say give him the cohost job.  Dont change a thing right now it works beautifully! ,ericzane,d2a8su4,3,t5_3cknj
7444673,0,t3_4h6rrb,Anyone know if that episode is still up?,ericzane,d2oeu8s,1,t5_3cknj
7561380,0,t1_d31o821,So then why werent there commercials in the other podcasts...?Im not talking about the  second ad that plays before the podcast can play. Im taking about the local ads that play during the podcast thats posted online.,ericzane,d31oxwc,2,t5_3cknj
7920721,0,t3_4mgl4l,Rutland VT.  Ive been a podcaster of FBHW for years now I do the same thing with the new show.  I have completely erased FBHWs from my computer no FB likes no podcast cancelled my VIP immediately even though it had just renewed and still lost access and no refund...thats fed up.  Happy that Eric is back on the radio and hope he kicks the S out of FBHW in the ratings.,ericzane,d46d3u2,2,t5_3cknj
8278374,0,t1_d5ccibx,you mean the guy that kept his identity secret so he wouldnt have to fear losing his job being outed was just a little sad???? Yeah I bet thats all that happened to him....,ericzane,d5cct2m,4,t5_3cknj
10565727,0,t1_dcxkheb,If anything he needs to channel his inner anger a bit more in a focused way of course. I miss the Zane that would go off on things like when he called venison poverty meat. Its okay to be angry. People arent going to tune out just because they dont agree with one thing you say,ericzane,dd5qtha,1,t5_3cknj
11047472,0,t3_5xj90k,I had a dream was back on fbhw and then I woke up and was really sad ,ericzane,dek7n0v,4,t5_3cknj
