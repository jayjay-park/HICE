1561822,0,t3_2c4skk,Whats up vaginal eczema sister!  I too have problems with with my eczema on my labia and around the entrance to my vagina.  Topical steroids can be ok to use on it though upolytrigon is correct to warn you.  Use them sparingly and you can be ok.  Sometimes I use maximum strength Vagisil on mine too.  Other than that your gyno can give you some things that may help.  Once the eczema attacks that area it can be hard to get to go away again.  The moisture feeds it and the skin is naturally sensitive.  Other than that I use lots of lube when having sex or sometimes have to take a sexual hiatus until it heals.  It sucks.  Having an outbreak down there leads to my vagina not being able to lubricate itself normally. As to why its flaring up... that can be a crap shoot.  Sometimes it could be irritation from vigorous sexual activity.  Allergies or stress can also trigger eczema outbreaks.  If I get a yeast infection itll trigger an outbreak there.  You could have a mild yeast infection and be unaware.  I would see a gyno if you havent already.,eczema,cjc1pld,1,t5_2rqqs

I am  months in and its been the hardest and most painful thing of my life. My skin has been my enemy until recently. Imagine your flares but all over your body and ten times worse. Try to use the steroid creams properly. Not using them properly could also mean using them too little as well as using them too much. You should grow out of the actual eczema that you are treating as you get older. Also try ice packs. They help a ton with the itch. Place it in a towel if its too cold and then place that on the part that itches. Itll stop the itch nearly instantly and give you relief for a bit.,eczema,cnaf5xj,3,t5_2rqqs

For example Takeaway food isnt great for your skin or body generally try reducing how much you eat Diet allergies are you aware of any? Do you manage them properly? Diet intolerances again are you aware of any and are they managed? Most people think they have an intolerance when they dont and exclude whole food groups  talk to your doctor. Alcohol Do you drink a lot of it? It reduces inhibitions so it makes you more likely to scratch.Sleep Scratching it is hard to beat here are some tips What are your pillows and sheets made of mate? If its not  cotton it drives me absolutely insane.  Hypoallergic filling for pillows and duvets comforter in usa? is important. Feathers in pillows fuck me right up. Wash your sheets regularly with nonbiological washing powder to prevent accumulation of dust mites and sweat. Heavy duty moisturiser before bed  sure you go through pillow cases faster but it helps.Negotiating with doctors If you feel they are failing you and you cant explain try writing a letter because you can just give them the letter. Be persistent even when they suck. Are you in the UK? If so you have got to badger them to get anywhere sometimes.Other medical conditions Eczema usually comes with hayfever and asthma do you have these are they managed well? I have found that if i have an allergic reaction it turns into eczema fast. Im allergic to soap so use I use hypoallergic soaps.  I have no pets as I am allergic to birdsdogscats. Do you have pets?Moisturiser  Try lots of different types keep talking to your regular doctor and rotate between them as some people report becoming sensitive to them Do you moisturise BEFORE washing hands? Are you using moisturiser as a soap substitute yet? Are you moisturising AFTER washing hands or showering?  Are you using a topical steroid AND moisturser? If so then leave a setting in periodGeneral Mental HealthDealing with eczema is hard and you are having a tough time  do you have a support network of family and friends to talk to if you feel the need? If not work on making one eh? Have you considered counselling or therapy?

I was just saying it isnt technically antiitch. But if you have arthritis pain from dishydrotic eczema or just regular dryness and redness itll definitely help. Petroleum is okay for dry cracked skin but for redness and irritation youre essentially just locking in whatever is irritating your skin and preventing moisture from getting in. Your skins natural moisture barrier gets out of whack after a while and can forget how to produce its own oils. This article explains a lot...Really if petroleum seems to work for you I would recommend using plantbased oils like olive oil or grapeseed grapeseed is great because its really thin and dries faster than olive oil instead if not just a nice lotion that doesnt contain petroleum or lanolin.If the CBD extract worked for you see if you can find Liberty Lotions highCBD formula at your local collectivedispensary.

The second being that I am much less likely to see any people other than my parents hardly seeing my old school mates. There is no pressure to look good and so when I start scratching I keep scratching in the confidence that no one will see the results of doing so.

7357865,0,t3_4fugkz,I find putting your normal moisturiser in the fridge overnight and putting it on the next day very soothing for allergic rashes. I had nonstop hive like blisters head to toe for about a year due to allergies and its absolutely awful not only is it not nice to look at its also very painful. Also cool not too cold showers are soothing. And of course use of a steroid cream is necessary to get rid of allergic rashes like that quicker a lot of people say they only work in the short term but it helps to get it under control again so just your normal routine of moisturising is adequate to deal with it.

Another tip wash his bedding once a month vacuum twice a month if you can. Im guessing mites probably migrate from his sheets to his pillow and get him from there but you can get protectant covers you just slip under your normal sheets and pillow cases that will help combat the mites. With fragrances its not as bad youre probably okay if you want to use some scented lotion on yourself and them pick him up right away.

I am a  year old female who struggled and still occasionally struggle with moderatesevere eczema. Mine got worse and worse until this past year when I went to a naturopath and they helped me out. Most of my eczema was solved by figuring out my food intolerances.First find a lotion that works for you. I use Aquaphor at night and right after my morning shower. It doesnt matter how sticky it feels it helps me so much.Go to a naturopath if your parents insurance allows. Just try it and it might be good for you. I thought it sounded stupid and I felt hopeless but I got to the point I would try anything. I am going to reiterate what was said before. Get lots of sleep and exercise and drink a ton of water.

8473990,0,t3_4vlg3t,I saw you replied to my comment on another thread but Ill reply here since same question. oI currently live in San Jose! But Im originally from Seattle so I find living near the west coast has done the best for my skin. However on the other hand I have heard tons of people with eczema suffering greatly when living in Seattlewest coast! My skin personally does the best in Seattle oddly enough since I do have pollen allergies. I think it might have to do with being near the ocean for me I saw a thread somewhere about ocean water being great for their eczema but Im not sure since San Jose has been doing ok for my skin too.As for San Jose its taken me longer to heal but my skin does really well with dry air. I moved from New York which was super humid heat and really bad for my skin so San Jose has been great but also dust is still bad. But I dont think there is any perfect weather for all eczema sufferers. If you know your triggers and for sure like city pollution and mold is bad for you maybe the west coast will be good. However I really gotta say like visiting a place for a couple weeks or like two months rather would be best way to test out if your skin likes it or not.,eczema,d60sgbq,2,t5_2rqqs

8993455,0,t3_53eeft,Exactly as uNeilJKelly said vaseline is not a moisturiser. Moisturising ingredients come in three forms Occlusive  Not inherently moisturising occlusive ingredients like petroleum jelly repel moisture sealing it in your skin when applied. Petroleum jelly is the most occlusive mineral oil or silicone a bit less so. Emollient  Emollients help restore your skins own water barrier which repels moisture like occlusives. Emollients include most oils and butters. Ceramides and cholesterol are emollient also. Humectant  Attracts water pulling it into your skin. Common humectants include glycerin aloe honey and sodium hyaluronate.So in other words Humectants bring the moisture to your skin. Occlusives keep it there until removed and emollients help repair skin so it can keep the moisture in without the presence of occlusives. A good moisturiser contains all three of these types of ingredient. Then if it has extra goodies like niacinamide for reduction of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and ceramides thats a bonus.My dermatologist kept pushing QV skincare products on me. More or less just mineral oil and water nothing to help my skin fend for itself. No thanks. I use a mineral oilemulsifier mix in the shower which washes off a shower milk then if my skin is dry Ill use a light lotion with ceramides if my skin is good and a thicker cream on problem areas. I tried using the thicker cream all over but it made me break out in a heat rash which was indistinguishable from the eczema leading to a vicious cycle of eczema and itching.,eczema,d7svh2s,4,t5_2rqqs

I just find it helpful to extend the same kindness to yourself that you do to other people. I think sometimes we forget to be kind to ourselves. You got this!! ,eczema,dc04v1h,16,t5_2rqqs
10412911,0,t3_5p4nun,My dishydrotic eczema has cleared up recently.  It happened when I started taking Zyrtec diligently every day for other health reasons.  Im sure its because I have an allergy to sds or sls in soaps and a nickel allergy.  The only other thing Ive changed is taking  IU of vitamin D daily since its winter which Ive also heard can help on here.  ,eczema,dcoddhn,3,t5_2rqqs

10646496,0,t1_dde2e7h,Ahh Got a CVS  mins away will definitely make a trip down there. Ill have to give that healing ointment a try hands have been flaring up and super dry lately and its driving me crazy. Sucks to experience stinging from simply washing your hands ,eczema,dde3rhh,1,t5_2rqqs
10684124,0,t1_ddhwryn,With my eczema I have it full body including my face and eyes I find myself rubbing them in my sleep to the point where the creases under my eyes will split and crack also makes my eyes puffy  try carmex just original carmex in the stick without getting it into your eye might make it water a bit from the menthol but it will calm the itching and pain hope this helps ,eczema,ddhzixm,2,t5_2rqqs

10915797,0,t3_5v2yqs,I found relief with oolong tea too.  However i noticed that drinking it daily also affected my nutrition absorption so i had to stop.I used to fast and eat rice porridge too as that meant i wasnt eating alot of foods that triggered my eczema.  You can actually add in a ton of vegetables and pulses to make it more nutritious.  Adding in some buckwheat may help as that is high in quercetin which is supposed to help leaky gut.  I also added some ginger tumeric and a tiny sprinkle of black pepper to help absorption of the tumeric.With fish beware of some tinned  canned fish as those which are not processed quickly can contain high levels of histamine  i found that out when i ate some canned mackerel which was a cheaper brand.Im guessing you are viet based on your username. Have you tried drinking chinese detox tea hui sup cha or five flower tea  ng fah cha?  You can find the herb mixes in chinese supermarkets.  I find those can take the edge off eczema as they remove heat and dampness which are factors in eczema according to traditional chinese medicine.I found bleach baths helped.  Imo it goes further than just killing germs and some studies show it has a mild anti inflammatory effect.  I found it similar to japanese hot springs in effect.  You can just rinse off after if you find it too drying  if you have wet type oozing eczema then the drying effect might be a bonus.Have you tried adding in a few drops of menthol oil to your tub of moisturizer that has a nice soothing effect.If you know someone that has high cholesterol and takes clofibrate capsules this might be of interestI personally use low dose naltrexone and that has toned down my eczema considerably. ,eczema,de5vyan,1,t5_2rqqs

11029469,0,t1_dei4hxp,Im jealous that you get to buy from a dispensary but yeah I hope it helps you the same way.My wife went to med school and she told me that steroids compromise the immune system and wasnt convinced that it was the best method for treatment topically with so many natural options coming available.,eczema,dei5yiy,1,t5_2rqqs

11195764,0,t1_df0jw1r,I cant imagine it would be too difficult to ask a dermatologist to put you on Dupilumab. If that is the case try to find another dermatologist.Definitely agree some of the replies here start the conversation early and gear up to the availability of this new drug.,eczema,df10yll,1,t5_2rqqs
11199738,0,t1_df0jw1r,I think you need to find a new derm then mine already gave me the green light but told me to have patience cuz new drugs take time to be approved and then of course theres insurance. If your eczema is full body and effecting your quality of life then any good derm would be willing to help. Seriously find a new derm you dont have to suffer!,eczema,df1h62t,1,t5_2rqqs

11339760,0,t1_dfhbfcp,Safe to say those of us posting in an eczema subreddit and legit counting down til Wednesday in my case haha are some pretty desperate people.  Youre not alone.As I said I would not take the kyr as indicative of anything like what you would pay for it.  If youre on insurance there will very likely be help there.  If not there are other avenues heck you could even try enrolling in one of the ongoing trials for asthmanasal polyps if youve got those issues too and youre near a test site And try to remember this is the beginning.  Dupilumab is the first monoclonal antibody to market and its going to post some big sales numbers.  But others are hot on the trail.  If there is such a thing as a good time period to be alive and have eczema this is the best example of it yet.,eczema,dfhcbos,1,t5_2rqqs
11361721,0,t3_623bn6,I use Protopic as well. It has really helped. I also use Restasis which has helped with my dry eyes and helps reduce the miserable itch. ,eczema,dfjtvug,1,t5_2rqqs

11492586,0,t3_64188b,Initial dose of  shots is in! It was totally easy and didnt hurt. I did the first in my belly and the needle didnt hurt at all. The second in my thigh had a little bit more resistance but I think its just because my skin is thicker there. I will probably stick with the belly from here on out.   ,eczema,dfyom8e,8,t5_2rqqs

11582231,0,t3_65aurk,Vaseline just keeps moisture in. It can get hot and irritating for me. I used it once and got hot and itchy immediately so I never used it again. Never use vaseline for hydration unless you already have some moisture you want to lock in with it.,eczema,dg8upia,5,t5_2rqqs

My skin is definitely a lot clearer than it was a year ago and even a few months ago However Im not sure about using it on my eyelids since it really burns on that skin when it doesnt on my hands.
