I had the joy of hearing a man discuss how his father spent the last week of his life in a hallway because they had no rooms for him to die in. So instead of bankrolling a new stadium maybe we should be focusing on the shortage of rooms. Do I believe the NDP is the fix all?

One option there is Athabaska University if you are good at distance and can do stuff mostly on your own. From classmates I heard siast is easier to talk to for distance.  For the accounting knowledge part the great thing is you have all but one of the accounting courses you need for CPA so you are mostly set there.  They are also industry oriented so you learn more of the stuff you will actually use.  How the courses work is most people get business certificate then do the accountancy program.

I wonder what the design is of the water facilities in PA and surrounding areas are like will Husky be continuing to provide compensation for any needed modifications to ensure safe water?  Im imagining the plants may actually need some modification to do so given they are hinting at the cleanup being impossible to fully complete and that the end result is going to be suprise releases of oil into the water on an ongoing basis for potentially years as erosion and rainfall change the water flow. That being said I have been impressed with the response from Husky todate and I am also impressed with the  percent recovery that has been achieved.  I doubt very much they will reach or get much above  percent though especially given the high water much of what is left is likely far down stream or dispersed and hidden among the silt and banks so much it wouldwill be deemed impractical to recover.mostly curious now as to why the line leaked was it due to contents design manufacture improper maintenance or inspections that were not regular or thorough enough.  more questions than answers and with a chilly September my saskatchewan horse sense is predicting an early freeze up. though probably not much snow.,saskatchewan,d7h8056,-1,t5_2r4dl

They would be right to blame some for sure.But what about the rest? They probably wont much appreciate being blamed for shit they had nothing to do with.Same thing with our current situation.Do you think we really enjoy having the blame thrusted onto us even though we had no choice in the matter? Think maybe some of us might retaliate when it is trusted onto us? Its only natural. Why not try a smarter approach?And here you think you FTFM yet you and at least  other people right now likely many more dont see the true context of all of this.You are making enemies out of the people who could have been your allies in something that does need to be made right. You blame those who are more likely to help the people who need it if they would but take responsibility for their own problems.So let me make this very clear for you and others who think like you.The idiocies of this countries people who actually HAD something to do with the residential schools and beyond are to blame.The idiocies of youth are to blame. He was likely trying to fit in with people he thought were cool. Like thinking drinking is cool.

9903476,0,t1_daxy2bv,I think that people too often forget that parties can change. The Democrats used to be against civil rights in America and had a stranglehold on the South until LBJ and the Civil Rights Act. That specific iteration of the SK NDP had a lot of union connections and decided to use them improperly just as Wall and the SP has done with their oil industry connections. For people who want an alternative the correct response would be to go to the NDP and ask that they get their shit together regarding the union bias. Its not like its simply impossible for them to change.,saskatchewan,dayg2jb,2,t5_2r4dl

Most will have you believe that campgrounds are packed to the gills from July through August but aside from the long weekends Id say theres very rarely a time when the park is so full theyd turn you away. Problems start when you have an overwhelming amount of campers with ft RVs looking for electricfullservice for an entire week.  These sites are high in demand but catering to this demographic results in more noise power consumption wider roadways tree removal and other characteristics more like a trailer park than a campground. Not that the parks arent more than willing to accommodate this its just that theyre bound to receive complaints from the other camper types that are looking for a quieter and more natural experience.I dont think more nonreserve sites will solve much if anything. There needs to be an attitude shift among campers to downsize their equipment and improve their flexibility. I think there might be some weight in expanding seasonal campgrounds as well only because cabin ownership is so prohibitively expensive. ,saskatchewan,dc2rw6f,2,t5_2r4dl
