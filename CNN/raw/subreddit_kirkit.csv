144615,0,t3_1vqeq8,Raina should be given this series and if he doesnt show that he has the game to succeed in these parts of the world he should be dropped for good. Considering the next worldcup is in Australia I dont know if we could rely on Raina.,kirkit,ceuwi74,1,t5_2zt2p

2605654,0,t1_cmwq0k6,rcricket IS Australia dominated and sometimes the bias shows recent eg. I wouldve liked to see a similar Kohli picture on the sidebar like the one they have for Steve Smith when he captained India for the first time in tests. I mean both got the captaincy in similar conditions where the current main captain was injured both are the cricketing future of their corresponding nations. Kohli was not a big deal but Steve Smith on the other hand..  I mostly lurk though so I take what I can get.. It is not like I contribute too much to the community and so I dont think I can complain much.,kirkit,cmyp2zc,1,t5_2zt2p
