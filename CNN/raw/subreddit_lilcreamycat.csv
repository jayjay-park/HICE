8886163,0,t1_d7fg7zr,I like SFW questions! . Mushrooms. Well...I really want to like them but I cant stand the texture.. I like to rub soft things against my cheek.. Id change my boobs so that theyd be bigger lol. For my personality Id want to stop overthinking everything.. I dont really have a passion and I actually dont really feel the need to find one. I used to buy into the idea that you had to have a passion or a dream job or something thats your true calling to really get the most out of life but for me Im happy to be able to hang out with friends that mean a lot to me dance a lot laugh a lot and just enjoy life and all the random shit thats funny in the world. ...Oh actually Im really passionate about food LMAO.. My friends. Taught me that people are different. Like they think differently go through a lot of shit thats different for each person... I know it seems like duh but it was a huge revelation to me. ,lilcreamycat,d7fzp24,3,t5_3fv0n
