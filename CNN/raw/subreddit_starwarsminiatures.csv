8837192,0,t3_4y1kb7,I hope Im not too late to post this!!Ive ordered from here over the past year. Theyve got very good prices for miniatures. The ones they still have at least. I bought my Vaders Apprentice off of them for about  bucks last year. I dont play the game anymore only ever had one friend who did play it back when I was about  so I just buy the minis for decorationdisplay purposes now but Ive bought about  minis from these guys mostly rebel troops and stormtroopers and theyve all been in top notch quality. Cards and everything. ,starwarsminiatures,d7a3th5,2,t5_2xiqu
