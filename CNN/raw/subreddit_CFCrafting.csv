8760311,0,t1_d70ozqf,I couldnt find the white bamboo thread anymore. It was already cancelled. Boo!!!  So its primarily a size  crochet cotton thread. The pink are silk. I washed it twice with a huge amount of Downy to soften up the work after it was done and before blocking so it was still very soft. Probably not as nice a drape as if it had been bamboo though. ,CFCrafting,d70p6w1,3,t5_3fpzk

9891649,0,t3_5gwqby,Love it!!After you make all the rectangles curtains pillows comforters etc if you want you could try clothes!  Other than not really being able to finish the inside seams without a serger it so satisfying to make something you can actually wear.  Skirts are hella easy and a great place to start.  If you want some inspiration I highly recommend bingeing on Project Runway past seasons.  Theyre available on Lifetime online or streaming app.  They inspire me because if some of the idiots on that show can sew clothes surely I can!!,CFCrafting,dawwl7i,1,t5_3fpzk
