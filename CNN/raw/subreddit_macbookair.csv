9849215,0,t3_5a93zd,Hardwarewise Apple will continue to support a model generally for about  years according to a Genius I talked to. I think its a safe bet that if the Mac can run the current OS then it will be supported by Apples techs even if you have to pay. Heres an example of Apples support. The motherboard died on my MBP four years after I bought it. The failure was covered by Apple so they replaced it for free despite the computer being four years old and long out of AppleCare support.Softwarewise Apple has been committed to keeping the bit Intel Macs covered. If you buy a early  MBA Id bet that you can reasonably expect  years of OS updates for it.,macbookair,dardj5l,1,t5_2wojj
