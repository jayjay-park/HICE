8971668,0,t3_535njt,I dont have a primer but in my experience there are a few things you can do giger data is wicked noisy so you can spatially filter it to remove some of the false alarms if you voxelize it and count points in each voxel or use something like FLANN to count how many neighbors each point has you can pretty readily fakeImtensity values. Giger LiDAR just counts the number of photons received while its looking at a particular spot this means thermal noise and a lot of other factors can give false readings. Dont trust it before you process it. Also random photon arrival often follows the Poisson distribution.,LiDAR,d7q9bv8,2,t5_2vwjx

10824213,0,t1_ddw6hd6,I will look into this. I used linear void filling instead of natural neighbor and the result was ok. It does stretch between tiles across areas of NoData but it does not seem to distort anything within the tiles. I can just manually get rid of the stretched zones. It just seems odd that this is an issue as if all las datasets are quadrilateral. ,LiDAR,ddwfwfb,1,t5_2vwjx
