44015,0,t1_ceizwok,Well its hit detection in combination with broken bad damage models across the board combined with some special cases of damage models that are hilariously broken combined with weapons doing inconsistent and silly damage levels .s should almost never be a threat to a P for instance combined with...well the list goes on.That said for mm cannons it still really depends on the plane and where it hit but the German mm was definitely competent at stopping bombers.  Its easy to come in and say Oh well that round didnt obviously drop the plane because well...the gun cam footage isnt very detailed turning it into a quasi Its simultaneously alive and dead argument about whether the plane survived or not.  But in reality the goal was never to outright shoot down the bombers so much as it was to stop them by any means necessary.  Damage requiring a plane to turn around was just as valuable as damage that outright dropped a plane.But yes the hit detection really is atrocious in this game.  Its probably the no.  reason the US . caliber HMGs are so horrible after tier  or  where planes start getting so fast that they basically hit less than  of the time.  By comparison a single mm round can cripple or kill almost every fighter in the game them doing too much damage in some cases.  Static testing definitely confirms that its not that HMGs arent doing silly levels of damage in some cases theyre doing too much but so many rounds completely miss due to the netcode that theyre rendered useless or nearly so.,Warthunder,cejfxqo,1,t5_2uc6j

46151,0,t1_cejjr3i,I dont believe that the developers are that bad. They are quite good at what they do actually. Also its not the developers that make these decisions. I dont want to rip on them. This is why I refer to Gaijin rather than a specific part of the company. As a gamemaking firm they probably have producers lead designers project managers and hundreds of other job positions. The developers get told what code to write usually. They dont just go hey lets fuck this shit up. Its even likely that sometimes some of them regret what they do since they agree with us the gamers but have no choice if they want to keep their jobs.So nothing is as simple as it seems. Yet things are simple altogether. The cash is what controls the direction so many of Gaijins ridiculous decisions can be explained with that. In this case perhaps they really did intend this as a fix for the Oculus Rift community. Its an investment in the future even though VR technology is going slow as fuck. But then again I am not convinced OR users would like this either. Why? Because they need to keep track of their targets exactly as much as the rest of us do.,Warthunder,cejoo7e,2,t5_2uc6j

This means that even with reserve aircraft it is possible to be matched with people flying Tier  aircraft.                Also matchmaking also works with what planes you bring to a match.  For instance if you play an Arcade Battle the highest tier among your planes currently readiedequipped will be the one that affects who you fight or play against.                    Planes also have whats called a battle rating which can also change a planes matchmaking.  The idea is that if a plane thats in Tier  is played often and has a better performance than anticipated the system would increase its battle rating and match it against higher tiered planes.,Warthunder,cel4yyp,1,t5_2uc6j

119439,0,t3_1vg7cc,I play RB just tier IIII so far.  I would agree that there are some very strong planes at all levels of the Russian tier.  The  MiG s the I and the LaFN all come to mind.  The latter two clearly have unfinished flight models as well.  Besides the strengths of the individual planes the Russians just seem to do well in the current RB metagame.  They are kind of jack of all trade planes that wont punish you for not playing them in a specific way.  For example if you are playing a heavier american fighter like a P or P and you climb directly at the enemy at the start of the match which is unfortunately the standard playstyle for a lot of people you are most likely going to lose.  The other team will almost certainly have an altitudeenergy advantage over you and thats pretty much a death sentence in an American plane it at least guarantees that youre going to be on the defensive.  By comparison most Russian planes have the climb rate and maneuverability to either prevent them from having an initial disadvantage or gives them the tools to negate them.    My win percentage with the LaFN was in the high s last time I checked.... and Im only an average player.  For comparison my win percentage with Ps is around .  I admit that I am Im kind of cherry picking here by bringing up the play style of Americans since some other nations like the Germans also seem to do pretty well in the current metagame.  Also another reason why the American RB teams seem to be at a disadvantage is the number of people flying bombers.... oftentimes an American fighter is going to be outnumbered.  ,Warthunder,ces15i0,1,t5_2uc6j

Sure the planes are similar tiers but if not for altitude advantage US team would get a lot more defeats. Shove there few RP and Lions bonuses and there may be people crazy enough to fight in Chaikas against Sabres P.But this idea is just a little brother of the main one which you very nicely expanded upon. If only Gaijin would take this seriously.Additionally I would also like mixed RB battles regardless of our feeedback BUT only for the trial period of lets say  weeks.

267168,0,t1_cf8g2ei,Whatever you say.I flew it myself a lot as well as its also one of my favorite aircraft from WW.At one point it was ok but before . i forgot which patch exactly...it made the aircraft completely awful. You can still kill people with it but any competent opponent will outperform you completely. This includes letting you climb. Its energy retention was atrocious its climb rate was abysmal and it didnt even have the turbocharger until one of the latest large patches.

267273,0,t3_1x5gp8,I dont care if they do remove them. But if they do will I get back all the Eagles I spent on upgrades to my crews? I have spent  to  on my crews alone.So really I would like them too If I get the eagles back. I could see a big difference in how log it took to kill the crews so I started by getting all the slots opened up and maxed them out too. And they are my only thing that gives me a edge to a higher Tier. If you really want to help!  Keep planes in the same Tier. Sure some planes have big guns but the other side is the other planes are faster or better turn rate. so things will balance them self out. But when you put a T Jap Wf  in a battle with a BearCat that plane can out preform it in every way. This is going to break this game before long. Everyone on the other side will start to quit when they find what planes they are fighting or rather dieing to .And the other county planes is junk too.If I want to be in a Spitfire I should play as British. the planes are often very unrealistic to the battles at hand.this is giving players a golden ticket to get high amount of kills where the should only get two or three. I know I get up to  kills in Realistic from time to time with the Jap Fw . the Zeros and Ki s and other planes get murdered And I will just clean house for the win. ,Warthunder,cf8go9o,1,t5_2uc6j

271564,0,t3_1x7ep3,Thank you for this AMA just two quick questions. Would it be possible to change the updating system so that you dont need to research the same modules time after time if you have opened the same upgrade with previous planes? For example I dont see a point in researching the same   cal ground target ammobelts in  US planes. . Would it be possible to readjustment the effect of different modules. Now the effectivity seems to crow exponential. Tier  upgrades seem give about  boost tier  gives  tier   and tier  over . This makes upgrading especially on ranks  and  quite hard. Is there something preventing the system from being adjustment so that tier  would get about  boost tier   tier   and tier  .?Now it feels that the plane is still stock untill you open the first tier  upgrade which makes the last upgrades too effective in comparison to earlier upgrades. ,Warthunder,cf8wp7k,1,t5_2uc6j

276917,0,t3_1x90p7,If youre in a heavy plane keep your speed up.  For example in a P you want your speed as close to  mph as possible at all times.  Facing a Zero if you are as close to  mph as possible the Zero will never be able to reliably engage with you.Never give up more altitude than you need to and remember that the more oblique the angle the less efficient the exchange between speedaltitude. If you enter into a very steep  degree angle diveclimbangle of bank for a turn it will be far less efficient and bleed far more speed than a  degree angle diveclimbangle of bank for a turn.

292481,0,t1_cfb2e8m,First of all thats a pretty big assumption.I have all the US jets and I enjoy the Panthers as much as the Sabres.I also enjoy the F more in RB and the F more in AB.All other jets dont become irrelevant when you get the final one.Alsohaving ONE import as the top jet means everyone can compete in an even footing at BR .Even if they added prototypes theyd be in a lower MM and still irrelevant as top tier jets.So let people who want to fly at BR . do so with their import and let people who want to fly WW jets and prototypes do it in the appropriate MM.Everyone is happy no?P.S USA was vastly underpopulated when it had only one Sabre and boomed in . when it got the Panther and F because the arcade players could have viable backups.Goes to show how much a full lineup is important.Back in .. the german jets were the most numerous in Arcade matches and the  and Mig were the most dominant.Meanwhilein RBthe lack of US pilots threw Migs and Meteors into Berlin. months laterwe have the same situation but now the Migs are absent.They have been equalized by the Sabres and their overall lineup is weak so new players go for US instead since it can do RB just as well and AB better.This only the top jet matters doesnt hold much water.,Warthunder,cfb2wpl,1,t5_2uc6j

But the broken FM and the not overheating engine makes up for that  times.If you stick to the Spit IX make sure you take advantage of its superior turnfighting capabilities and its broken climbrate.,Warthunder,cfp3bcg,2,t5_2uc6j

You can try to stay high and BnZ to start with and try to always squad with people that have migs so you get at least a few s on your team.Your team is the most important thing also dont turn with anything unless youre sure its a v.

Rolling with the keyboard and then pitching up with the keyboard is the best way to turn and avoid the dreaded death wobbles. Pitching with the keyboard also makes loops split s and immelmans easier. Get good at that and you will out maneuver most MK users and not have so much trouble with joystick users.

You are giving him an in to maintain initiative on you because he benefits from the dive far more than you do.  Instead you should abuse your higher top speed and acceleration and fly in a steep climb shallow climb level flight or a shallow dive basically anything but a steep dive or a hard maneuver. KMPH is about the top out speed of a .  Not far fetched at all.  The  is likely more energy efficient than the jet and while you are at those high speeds  he is holding onto the energy better than you are so he can close that gap once you disengage from the dive.,Warthunder,cga0h22,6,t5_2uc6j

I was flying at  feet patroling the front lines when I spotted a German at my  oclock high diving down out of the sun onto my tail.  Took every ounce of my knowledge and ten minutes of hard maneuvering to turn the tables on him.  I was trembling by the time the fight was over.  Once I got on his six he had called someone on teamspeak to come help him and dove down about  feet to drag me to his friend.  I stayed on him like stink on shit put a hell of a lot of hits into him but then his friend laid into me.I had to belly my Hurri in on the ground.

As eager as I am to get behind the controls of a T and sealclub some Panzer IIs while laughing at their pathetic return fire I dont want another buggyass game on my harddrive. Im perfectly okay with them taking another year to squash bugs if they need to.Sticking to release schedules burned one of my favorite devs oddly enough and made one of my favorite games a bit worse off.

It is quite like MiG vs Sabre where you are the MiG. You accelerate better he has better top speed.

Im only average at best but Im willing to live with it as I enjoy flying st person with a stick vs. rd person mk.It can be frustrating at times but it is also much more rewarding for me when I earn those kills or out fly the other player in defensive maneuvers.From what Ive seen on a lot of the CBT videos a lot of tankers are enjoying the style of play in SB over arcade and RB.  Im normally an RB person now but plan on trying to move over to SB to prep for this shift in play style.

740636,0,t1_cgoejos,ok so I did just to let you know I never play arcade so my definition of doing good or tactics may be different from yours. Very first game I got  crits one on a JU and a BF E which I easily out maneuvered only to die when I got jumped by  more. we lost that match.nd match we won I easily again out maneuvered  BF Es though a rd jumped me and messed me up but thanks to arcade physics I returned to repair then continue to out dogfight a BF before we won by points.really I have no problem evading or getting my sights on the BFs even with cockpit and joystick killing them isnt even that hard given they like to turn for some odd reason. Its when I have to break off due to another contact or bleeding off too much speed to chase that makes it a bit more challenging but not impossible to win.

760227,0,t3_22v4df,Dont bother climbing to the side FWs do this anyway because of Bearcats. You want to keep your speed up because the P is really agile at high speeds above kmh you can outturn spits because of the compression the spit suffers from climb at about a  degree angle maintain something like a  kmh climb speed and be ready to level out and start a shallow dive if you get bounced. While people call the P a pure BNZ plane War Thunders flight model scoffs at this and its really one of the more agile fighters in the upper end of Era IV though in return it accelerates much worse than the real world Stang. You can easily out dogfight and maneuver most FWs in every way except very low speed roll rate though if they change the D flight model that will always outroll you those things should have hydraulic ailerons but dont currently. Dont try to do a flat turn fight your opponent if good will just pull a high yoyo and end up behind you and you also expose the top part of your plane allowing an easy wing shot or a pilot snipe. Barrel rolls and scissors are the most important things to use when flying defensively if you pull one off properly you can reverse near any situation.Once you master that sort of thing its waaay harder for the Focke Wulves to fight you than it is for you to fight them.,Warthunder,cgqozy1,2,t5_2uc6j

Players complained loudly about the changes in . but they still went through and we still suffer from most of them  months later. Those planes have just been massively nerfed and have a repair price that stops a large number of players from even attempting to fly them. And thats in the least popular nation by far with the least planes to chose from. Adding a repair cost that further limits the choice of planes to play does not in any way help. Japan is not the least popular nation because their planes are so great for their BR. ,Warthunder,cgs82mr,14,t5_2uc6j

775849,0,t1_cgsgint,Well. The way I think of it is that Germans are severely underpowered this patch and most likely the next too. And with the next patch the main Japanese problem the NK being the same cost to run as a small country there will be less of those.That just leaves the Russians and the British to worry about. The British are getting new spitfires so Im not too keen on facing Spitfires in my Mustang in realistic battles Why do I face British?!. And of course Russians get their Yaks downtiered so that is also a problem though Russians being a problem is nothing new.So In conclusion dont worry too much about German or Japanese planes the ones American planes faced worry about the planes that America never faced in real combat like spitfires..

835066,0,t1_cgyvwzm,Yeah I am. Thanks for catching that discrepancy! I have no idea how I managed s instead of s probably just parsed the results incorrectly.I had edited in a table for a rate of climb comparison like I did for the time but I think it got nuked in one of my later edits and didnt catch it until it was too late. Reddit was doing this weird thing where the edit window didnt reflect what was actually posted until I refreshed the whole page  weird. To actually address that I sideeyed the ingame performance quite a bit after doing the math ftmin is probably insane! but later found the linked J chart as well as an article on overall P performance which showed that a lightly loaded G was capable of ftmin climb. Now you can pretty much find any article or chart or anecdotal data to support any supposition you make about an aircraft so I sideeyed this article pretty hard too. I should have included this article in my original post but had already edited enough for the day.Ive tried climbing three different ways.   because its easy  mph IAS which is less easy but still pretty handsoff  matching ingame IAS as closely as possible to that charts altitude specific TAS speeds factoring  difference between IAS and TAS for every ft or so. I found that there was very very little difference in performance between the three. Ive no idea what if anything that says about the flight modelling.All ingame tests done with  minutes of fuel as I believe most of the USAAF performance tests were performed with limited fuel and conservative but not outlandishly so engine management.Thanks for your post!For the sake of full disclosure all mistakes and inferences in my OP and subsequent posts are totally on me and I should really be less careless  should proofread my posts better.,Warthunder,cgz76t4,2,t5_2uc6j

Instead of flying a nameless B now you can fly a specific plane from a specific squadron or fly Ferocious Frankie or even add small changes like putting on swastikas to make it more realistic. I havent seen any skins that looked that bad that werent joke skins. Maybe you should give the skins a second chance. I dont really think the devs put that much time into the skins either.

This is especially so if youre using a hairy stick and not an airbrush and compressor.

It hugely negates the advantage of getting off the first shot. I like that your crew doesnt get killed outright when they get hit but I think the crew recovery speed needs to be increased heavily to  to  seconds. Also the crew recovery should be reset with each new hit so keeping the fire on an enemy tank has the effect of keeping it out of the action. ,Warthunder,chl5is7,8,t5_2uc6j

Most planes were shot down by other planes.  What theyre doing is making it harder to do perfect bombing runs on tanks.

Lower glacis is for the vast majority not a weakpoint at all. The commander cupola while being easy to penetrate will at best allow you to wound the commander... which doesnt actually do that much right now unless you use fragmentation in which case depending on the angle of the frags they might end up inside the fighting compartment and to a whole lot of messIf on front search for machineguns and driver hatches. On some germans especially at higher tiers some turrets have decent shell trap where even if the shell does bounce off of the lower part of it it will bounce on the upper side of the tank especially true on the FerdinandHitting the turret ring is always a good idea against highly armored foes. When shooting on the side aim for the engine usually on the back or if you know each individual tank ammo racks.And if everything else fails HE to the gun might net you a lucky gun jam and if they try to shoot you back the shell will detonate in their barrelApart from that prepare to die a lot and get stuck a lot.

1093649,0,t3_26n735,Tier  Germany is an incredibly frustrating place.  The way Warthunder RB is set up and the way the planes are balanced currently means you lose a lot.  People will give you some tips but you need to accept now that even if you fly perfectly you will lose over and over again and the repair costs will mean you struggle to break even at mid tier .  It is a thoroughly unrewarding nation to play I recommend against it.  If youre deadset on it I can give you some specific tips but my general advice is DONT.Major issues  German BR are too high for many aircraft in tier .  We can argue about specifics but I honestly say it is all Tier  fighters. German repair costs are too high in Tier  and Tier .  He is x as expensive to repair as the Fc. German flight models poor turning mean that they are obligate boom and zoom aircraft.  Boom and zoom is how they get kills and how they win matches but there are two big reasons this has become a problem.  First the upgrade system hits climb rate especially hard meaning that a stock spitfire can still turn fight but a stock  wont have altitude over anybody.  No altitude  no boom and zoom meaning stock German fighters are completely at the discretion of their opponents.   The second issue is the introduction of allied planes with superior climb rates to Germany.  A long time ago . era Germany had the best climbing planes and used that to boom and zoom.  Now we have planes like the Bearcat and Spit which both out climb s and s.  Since these allied planes also turn better the German planes... its hardly a fair fight.   Germany has no high tier bombers which can compete with Bs.  Any match against the US will face Bs and the Germans simply have no answer for their own ground attacks which means that Germany must eliminate every US player and AI before the ground target timer runs out.  Germany is fully dependent then on the balance between ground target destruction and the tick rate of your team points Gaijin has continuously played with this balance and it clearly strongly favors the US at the moment.  As a result Germany will lose the majority of games played at T and T just by the fact that most games will be against the US and those are almost always decided by ground targets in favor of the US.  The reason this is important is that losses give very poor RP so German players will have a drastically lower average RP per match and thus progress much slower. Forced use of boom and zoom tactics because you cant turn well mean that games are long and frustrating for German pilots.  You can never engage any enemy plane at equal or greater altitude to yourself so you have to run away from a lot of fights.  Coupled with the balance of ground targets and you end up losing most RB games before you ever engage an enemy.  You MUST continue to climb before engaging but you also MUST protect your ground targets from the bombers flying at  meters.  This is an impossible choice for the pilots and the result is they lose a lot.  If you arent prepared for that reality then you should choose an allied nation that is easier to play and more capable of victory. German flight models and the instructor are inferior to allied planes.  Go fly a  roll  degrees and try to use some elevator to turn.  Notice what happens?  The rudder kicks hard and the plane starts to sideslip through the air totally fucking up your aim.  This happens in all s and we dont know why.  Now go fly a Bearcat and do the same maneuver the difference alone should be enough to convince you to never fly Germany again.Overall I use my G mostly now to grind my He.  I have a fully upgraded D and a partially upgraded Ta but its just too damn frustrating to fly.  My D has a win rate of .  Im not trying to brag but Ive been playing RB in this game for a long long time and I know what Im doing and thats my only plane with a rate so low.  I think it is indicative of very serious balance issues that Gaijin is reticent to address. ,Warthunder,chsloc5,20,t5_2uc6j

The early German panzers before the open end of following Versailles were literally described to Allied observers as tractors for this reason.Youre completely ignoring the fact that the Sherman was not useless against enemy armor against its contemporary and most numerous opponents which were variants of the PzIII and PzIV the Shermans cannon was perfectly capable and its armor was comparable.The Shermans lack of wet ammo storage was fixed very quickly but the nicknames persistedif every tank is to be judged by its teething problems very few are going to be considered any good. Even the Panther famously lost more tanks in its first showing at Kursk to mechanical problems than to enemy fire. Throughout the war the Sherman had remarkably high records for crew comfort and survivability reliability under fire and accuracy on the move. The Sherman actually held some pretty significant advantages over the T as well additionally the Shermans frontal armor was comparable to the T.The Sherman as you mentioned also excelled in versatility and this versatility allowed it to undergo modifications that kept it abreast of the latest variants of the T StuG and PzIV. The Panther and Tiger would always outclass it but both were newer designs.,Warthunder,chwpigx,3,t5_2uc6j

At this moment the order and priority of release of new aircraft is a little confusing and frankly a bit disheartening too.For example a bunch of historically unimportant planes have been added We just got several models of the I an aircraft of which only  were built and which never saw combat action and was infamously unreliable. The XP and XP both aircraft with singledigit production numbers both never having seen action were also added a while back. There are more examples of course La the Heimatschtzer variants of Mes etc.While on the other hand planes which played important roles in the war are neglected We have only one real version of P for over a year now while it was one of the most important fighters for the USAAF during WW. The PJ and L versions are notoriously absent and the XPG never existed. The British tree is still missing quite a few of its important multiengine bombers the Halifax  built Stirling  Hampden  several variants of the Lancaster  the Whitley  then British versions of the B B B B etc. The US tree is also missing quite a few historically important aircraft  the Marauder  built a nonpremium Invader  and late model Liberators including Navy variants. etcetera JM Raiden FF Tigercat Heinkel He British Corsairs and late Mustangs FH Banshee...Basically along with an updated release tree itd be nice to know that historically significant aircraft have priority over unimportant whatif aircraft.,Warthunder,chycdyx,161,t5_2uc6j

Game balance is probably the biggest complaint I see with this game though and that complaint seems to intensify every time you make adjustments with your current system.As awesome as statistics are they have their limits and have to be used in combination with lots of other statistics and some common sense to be useful. Maybe if you published all of your statistics used it would help convince people you are taking the right approach. ,Warthunder,ci024lz,9,t5_2uc6j

1165851,0,t3_27ggai,I personally dont see why Gaijin cant either A. Make repair costs standard across battle ratings Spit  at . has same repair cost as other planes at . etc. orB. Remove repair costs entirely and just deny income if the aircraft is absolutely totaled. Ram pilot knockout crash killed by rocket etc.Hell. They could set all repair costs to  for a week and collect data on that. How much damage can a single week do of increased amounts of derps  arseholes on the servers. But making it so that  series spit aces have to sell a kidney or  to finance their aircraft isnt balancing them its just encouraging the better pilots to take fewer risks. And if they take fewer risks then theyre not going to be shot down as much. Personally Im probably going to stop playing  series spits if they keep increasing repair costs K? What the fuck are you smoking gaijin? because experienced british pilots make the baddies in Ps and FFs cry on the forums.Fun fact  series spits can now only make a profit with  kills and an assist with premium if you end up dying!

I am not a good player in this game I believe myself to be average and not worse only because there are a lot more stupid people in this game than there are great players and that lowers the bar. Your concern about RB and wasting the x is very understandable but Ive found I play a lot more cautiously when Im going for the x and that helps a lot. My goal isnt to push for a kill no matter what its to survive the match. Even if you just survive and have only got a couple of hits on an enemy and nothing else your x will be as much as a very dull AB match with x. Youll find that going in with this mentality will help you stay alive and get kills. Just climb very high and not directly towards the battle and youll surely spot a vurnerable enemy below you at some point. If only I could always play this patiently all the time lol.About the premium typhoon... I had a match earlier where all I did was kill a Pillbox and one Artillery position before being shot down.

1231556,0,t1_ci7qmx0,Boy you must be high or something. Lets Crunch the numbers shall we? T  for the sake of the argument lets take the T has  mm armor all around on the chassis and  mm turret front. This means that both Panther and the Tiger can penetrate the tank frontally assuming  degree angles on the turret armor from  meters away since the Tiger has  mm of penetration at that range and the Panther somewhere around  mm of penetration. Now the  mm gun on the T  has to go through  mm armor for the chassis and turret of Panther respectively  I am ignoring the Tiger since its armor is even thicker and responds better to angling the tank at range due to mm on the side that is assuming it is not angled which if it is not than the guy driving it is an absolute noob. Gun penetration values for T   are mmmm and mm of armor at m  m  and  m respectively. This means that T   can penetrate the Panther frontally at only  meters or less. Therefore unless T   manages to flank the opponent driving a German vehicle or Close the distance gap undetected it will be dead at a significantly longer range. This by the way in no way reflects the fact that Panthers gun is actually far more accurate which surprisingly IS modeled in the game.  ,Warthunder,ci8616m,1,t5_2uc6j

1341846,0,t3_29fhx5,ABRBSBOne of the few tanks I actually enjoy along with the T. Short of having to face derp cannons  mm and above firing HE it is incredibly durable at ranges  since that is when most guns have a huge penetration drop off. Staying at that range effectively eliminates the threat from the soviet tanks with smaller guns. RBSB Added bonuses for these two modes is the gun. While only  mm which means it will often take  shots to take out bigger tanks notably KV  IS series unless you manage to take out ammo rack with first shot it has extremely high muzzle velocity meaning you will not have to compensate for the drop as much. It also seems to be much more accurate then soviet guns noticed it on Kursk after not being able to do the same feats in my T as in the Panther. Penetration values are fantastic all you need to know is that it can go through  mm of  flat armor at  m. This means that aside from IS and German Tiger IIs and late TDs in Arcade you will not have much of a problem penetrating stuff since most of the fighting you should be doing is between  m. THE ARMORGood frontally especially if you know how to angle. Honestly hate to mention it but watching some of the WoT videos that explain this aspect might be a bit helpful. Pointing it out because there are a lot of them. Side armor is where the news are shit mostly because is armor is shit. If you got flanked are on the reload and anything has a shot at your side you are basically done since a shot to the center of the tank detonates the ammo rack. Another note turret armor is actually weaker than hull armor meaning hide between shots. Shots to the turret also take out the gun quiet often and shots through the lower frontal plate will set you on fire. This means that the tank is a bit painful for the first half a dozen games while you unlock the parts and the extinguisher.Side note on tactics Snipe. DO NOT BRAWL WITH ANYTHING  doing so takes away the main strength of the tank. While it can flank it is no where near as good at it as soviet mediums which are basically designed for it due to shitty guns. Also stick with Ausf D  the first one. Reasons are as follows its battle rating allows to find games fairly quickly it is basically the same tank up until Panther  at least for now until some of the more subtle aspects are modeled into the game,Warthunder,cikknbm,3,t5_2uc6j

1352423,0,t1_cilqt2c,This is the worst you can do.The FMs that people always talk about being broken in arcade are in all honesty just exacerbated. That means that planes accelerate faster top speed is stretched higher and since wings dont rip g is possible.However that also means that diving at a decent clip while rolling and pushing rudder to max will flatspin a p like it does in rb  just at higher speeds. It also means that planes still stall. It just takes longer and is more dangerous to play around because a plane can seemingly accelerate much faster than it did in RB.As for BNZ you can do it just as you do in RB. The real difference is you need to push speeds harder and land more hits  also not forgetting that most planes can turn very quickly and still spray a few bullets as you gain separationzoom climb.Aside from that its not that different. Planes are a bit more responsive wings dont rip DMs are a lot more lenient and a critfire isnt almost a kill on most planes.note as some have stated because DMs are more lenient firepower is normally preferable HOWEVER some planes that handle like shit in RB are still shit in Arcade cough do n cough.A good practice for BnZ in arcade are the russian yakTK series since they are more forgiving followed by US and then German.At least that was my progression as the FW series does not forgive at all if you bleed speed in a slight corner.,Warthunder,ciltg2m,10,t5_2uc6j

1379488,0,t1_cioy8nl,Starting out at  Km two Bearcats engaged me from  Km a  Km height advantage I leveled out and flew towards teammates that were roughly  Km away giving those two bearcats easily enough altitude to dive on me and make my speed next to useless so then i turned on one of them knowing I can turn faster than Bearcats a spitty then came into the frail around  km altitude in which I had to gain speed to run from him by diving and getting up to  Kmh by this time I was at  Km with three aircraft trying to shoot me down. Two more bearcats then decided to dive on me one giving me a black wing making it impossible to turn so I began my death dive. All five aircraft then proceeded to tail me as I fell to the ground hence the shot you see in the post where I am falling to the ground uncontrollably This is where a joystick would be useful and I have five aircraft all trying to get the credit for the kill. Oh and all the while my team remained roughly  Km away engaging bots whilst I constantly used the radio option of I need cover!I tried my best I may not be the best pilot but I sure can hold my own in a fight however when confronted with five different aircraft one with the ability to out turn me and the other four able to defeat me in any other way it made it very difficult to get out of that frail alive. However I did critically damage two bearcats one of which crashed awarding me an aerial victory after the kerfuffle had subsided. Here is roughly how the positioning worked for all players on this map  The aircraft with the arrow is mine.I know I should have remained close to my team for support but I did not see it necessary as they were engaging bots and were already at a low altitude. ,Warthunder,cip7cft,1,t5_2uc6j

It is a rough estimate based on your planes historical specs meant as a guide to determine which plane has a slight edge over other planes.  If your plane is underperforming it is not because the BR is low it is because the engine isnt powerful enough or the plane is too heavy or has too much drag or the flight model is inaccurate or the turning radius is too large.  BR has absolutely nothing to do with it.  BR is a result of values not a predictor of values.Plane performance dictates  BR NOT BR dictates  Plane performance.,Warthunder,cj8hzu4,-11,t5_2uc6j

1535461,0,t3_2bt5vb,I think RO gtRO  by a large margin.  More specifically the Darkest Hour mod but I suppose its all a matter of taste.  I think the original release of RO  was hated by many of the RO  vets because they pandered to the COD crowd with level progression and unlocks.  The maps are for the most part small and offer little room for maneuver.  Tanks seemed like an after thought as there are only a couple of maps that use them.  The modeled interior made it a pain in the ass to add additional vehicles and theyve relied on the community to front that work like the half tracks.  Speaking of half tracks due to the small maps they are mostly useless.  The work taken just to get them put into the game has made the community that was working on vehicles quit.  Too much trouble.   Tripwire said on release Sept  that theyd hope to get the Panzer T added to the game that Christmas.  They denied ever saying that until a user posted a screenshot of the announcement where they changed their story about lack of fundingresources.   Now almost Aug of  they made an announcement that they will be adding those tanks on top of the much desired MG.  A weapon where there was proof supplied that it showed up during Stalingrad but no record of the Mkb .  Etc. Etc. Etc.

Also you need to understand that should you introduce mixed battles you will be fundamentally taking the game away from a lot of people.  Even if matchups arent historical they sort of resemble historical i.e. Russia vs Germany over Kuban etc.  I might not be fighting the correct models of s or Yaks but its close enough to give me the immersion Im looking for.

1596756,0,t1_cjg9dty,gtThe name Hetzer was at the time not commonly used for this vehicle. It was the designation for a related prototype the E. The koda factory for a very short period confused the two names in its documentation and the very first unit equipped with the vehicle thus for a few weeks applied the incorrect name until matters were cleared. However there exists a memorandum from Heinz Guderian to Hitler claiming that an unofficial name Hetzer had spontaneously been coined by the troops. Postwar historians basing themselves on this statement made the name popular in their works the vehicle was never named as such in official documents.gt It was first known as Leichtes Sturmgeschutz t then Jagdpanzer t fr .cm Pak  L and finally Jagdpanzer  Hetzer. It appears that the name Hetzer was not an official name but used by troops and then used in postwar publications.gtThe Jagdpanzer t is largely known by its casual nickname of Hetzer. In translation Hetzer signifies baiter as in bullbaiting. The Hetzer name was not originally associated with the Jagdpanzer t and was related to another related Skoda Works prototype known as the E. Internal documentation oftconfused the two with names appearing somewhat interchangeable offering confusion in the long run. It is reported that German troops began the Hetzer name association with the Jagdpanzer t and historians continued with the name association after the war.,Warthunder,cjgfv2b,5,t5_2uc6j

1678507,0,t3_2dlg3o,zoom climbstay at ground altitude until you reach kph. Climb until you reach M. Only engage if you are above kph. If you drop below that you should seriously considering disengaging. In an A youre going to be playing more of a support role which means you have to remain close to friendly planes and cant go on crusades against fleeing enemies. Use your C button liberally. Communicate with your teammates. If you are not being attacked trade airspeed for altitude. ,Warthunder,cjqqldk,4,t5_2uc6j

1820300,0,t1_ck8fdjg,Vertical on means your guns will hit the convergence point on the crosshairs rather than dropping below it. I always have it on. For the US  in the cobra it is a low ROF gun with a slow muzzle velocity but when it hits you tend to down the enemy plane. Because its a slow round and there are not a lot of the  you want to be close when you ope. Up. I set convergence to  and wont usually fire the  past  unless its a bomber or someone running in a straight line. However because the best  guns are all centrally mounted .. you dont really lose any effectiveness shooting something closer so from  yard to ... Boomdakdakdakboom. Since the  is in the nose center mount only vertical convergence matters angling the gun up to cross the aiming point at a specific range. The cowl mounted s are shoulder width apart  you can score hits with them out to  with m convergence.And then the wing mounted guns sadly you cant remove them to drop the weight of the plane and increase rollrate. With m set the . in the wings are good from about  to  meters. You can run them as stealth ammo iirc been a long time since Ive flown cobras so you are only watching tracers from your  and cannon. ,Warthunder,ck8j60j,1,t5_2uc6j

1829083,0,t3_2fimtz,There isnt a whole lot of difference from flight performance perspective between the US and Germany. While I fully recommend focusing on one nation to start with it gets to a point where you need variety.  Trust me on this Ive been playing since very shortly after they opened the beta. You need more variety than one nation.Be this because of the map rotation changes to flight mechanics changes to damage models or simply having a shit day and cant get a win even if you paid for one.Its at times like those that its good to be able to go jump into some other nation and get some quick wins.Also as some others have mentioned the best way to figure out how to kill something is to fly it yourself.  People can very quickly identify the negative aspects of a thing that impacts them.In terms of fun planes to fly early on I personally like the kitty hawk.  The ps are also excellent platforms. Steady and powerful they teach you very early on the way to fight the American way.In terms of leveling up it depends on the game modes you play. If you only want to play AB.  Then Id suggest getting your ground repairs and re arm skills up as high as possible swiftly followed by the g tolerance and keen vision skills.Speed that across all the slots you have available. If however you will be playing RB or SB.  Do not spread those skills around. Focus them on your first slot in your line up. You want that pilot and his aircraft repair and rearm to be as awesome as possible. ,Warthunder,ck9li4i,2,t5_2uc6j

The entire game experience is shaped by this for the worse.   This is the main reason why youre sitting around for  minutes waiting for a match.Instead they should be using high tier play to encourage players to use all tiers to make money to fund their crack jet habit.Note that setting the daily x bonus to an entire nation instead of pervehicle is a major element of this screwup.,Warthunder,cka1ayp,4,t5_2uc6j

Anywaysgt Broken DM however wasnt a reason why it was ranked low  majority of planes have broken DM.Standard BR ranking practices  Firepower gt RoC gt DM gt Everything Else overall agility fuel load ammo belt size etc.This flow is the only thing that explains the Mustang Ia at BR . the FUC at . despite having performance more in line with BR . still has the wrong FM... the Me  fighting against Fs something about having more RoC and firepower than many korean war era jets and fuel not being that big a problem in AB and so on and so forth.  It just so happens that in the FFs case its firepower is middlingpoor in the grand scheme though actually not terrible for BR . its RoC is average though is averagegood at . its DM has been fragile the major thing dragging it down and the soft bonuses it get from EE goodgreat agility solid fuel load amazing ammunition endurance just dont amount to enough in actual games to drag it back up.This is all from AB however where a strong DM is a hell of a lot more important than being able to fire for  seconds without needing to land to reload where RoC is still king and agility will either let you be a god or get you killed depending on how any furball develops.

1962976,0,t3_2h4e7r,I disagree except for Tier V tanks. The FPE and Repair Kits should be purchasable from the get go with lions or have the option to research them for free. They are far too essential to game play to force people to grind for those two modules. This is especially true for RBSB modes and the upcoming changes to spawn for tanks. The upgrades for tanks are a little out of hand as tank games are much slower for any of the modes than plane games. The current cost to fully upgrade the T is  research points with a BR of .. The current cost to fully upgrade the MiGbis is  research points with a BR of .. So the game mode that is slower costs  more RP to upgrade. I dont care that much since most of the upgrades seem to do nothing but if we have a game mode that is slower it should not cost more to upgrade those vehicles. As far as module costs for Tier IV and V planes they are fine with the exception of the Meteor Mk  and its first unlock but I believe that Gaijin said they would change that. The rest of the jets and super props take time to unlock but nothing that detracts me from playing the game.  I just started playing with my German MiG last night and I am already half way through the first unlock in  games. I was also finishing up some unlocks for my high tier German props and ended up getting two and a half of them in one game and they were Tier IV unlocks. edit to add something,Warthunder,ckpqnw6,1,t5_2uc6j

1983625,0,t1_cks6ifd,Its pretty hard in a game with complex DMs.You could poor hundreds of MG rounds into a bomber killing his gunners taking out an engine shredding control surfaces. The plane is no doubt striken but with a sufficiently skilled pilot it could possibly be landed but its unlikely. Then along comes Johnny Tempest and dumps a mm HE shell right in the pilots lap from a high angle dive.Who deserves the kill? Obviously the tempest was the one who finally put the enemy down but what about your work? What if the enemy plane was all but dead say both engines out but still gliding? What about if it was missing a wing and spiraling to the ground?What counts as a dead plane and how do you figure out who is ultimately responsible?Its not a programming issue its a design issue.

2061675,0,t1_cl1vesh,either way it helps to diversify your gameplay to understand how to fly each type of plane so that you know its strengths and weaknesses when going up against it in another plane.also something that i found is that if two equally skilled pilots come up against each other the one in the energy fighters will usually win if he keeps his energy up simply because if he flys correctly he is always either above or behind his opponent and if for say the opponant is in a spit fire there is no way he will be able to dodge an attack then straighten up and start shooting before the energy fighter is  meters away same with the boom and zoomer but once a bnzer is going slow he is pretty much dead except if he dives but a  can catch almost anything in a dive same with the bearcat. this is just my personal experience because I play to a set of rules and never break them. speed and altitude above all else doesnt matter if my team mate is in trouble of about to steal my kill if it means going low and slow in an energy fighter then i simply fly away until i have speed and altitude again,Warthunder,cl1vtxd,1,t5_2uc6j

Removing the alternate history and training missions is an option but I would rather see incentives to fly other nations. Incentives could be anything from special events to reducing repair costs for other nations looking at you Britain and Japan.

GMT on October th to . GMT on October th gt RP on SB M SB M SB M MB SB M gtImagegtIn the years following the formation of the USSR the aviation sector in the s and early s saw considerable upheaval followed by the rise of several brilliant aeronautic designers. The establishment of several design bureaus led to the creation of many advanced types of aircraft one of these designers was Andrey Tupolev and his design bureau in the TsAGI which led the way with innovative designs and technological breakthroughs as evidenced with the ANT.gtgtAs the previous generation of medium and long range bombers had begun to become outdated several departments within the VVS also known as the Red Army Airforce and the Experimental Aerodynamic Design Bureau began discussions about aircraft designs for the future. The needs of VVS indicated the prevalent theory of the day in military thinking as the Italian General Giulio Douhet had written in The Command of the Air this theory exemplified that a bomber of sufficient speed and altitude would always be able to deliver its payload and strike its target no matter the opposition a theory Stanley Baldwin simplified as The bomber will always get through.gtgtSo it was that the VVS set out a proposal for a new fast bomber design capable of at least  kph of reaching and maintaining an altitude of  meters and with a minimum range of  kilometers carrying a payload not less than  kilograms. TsAGI under the chief engineer Aleksandr Arkhangelsky having already been working on this project was quickly able to set about designing this new skorostnoi bombardirovshik SB or Fast Bomber which would receive the design designation ANT.gtgtImage gtThe design featured most strikingly a fully metal construction fuselage wings and stabilizers all being stressed skin metal this mid wing monoplane design was aerodynamically clean with semiretractable landing gear enclosed cockpits and crew positions and internal bomb stowage but still one of the smallest twin engine bombers used in the war. Initially it was decided the first ANT prototype was to be powered by a  hp American built Wright Cyclone radial engine a second prototype would be powered by French built HispanoSuiza Y engines with hp available.gtgtOn the th of October  the First prototype ANT powered by the Wright Cyclone engines made its first flight carrying out nine test flights before the aircraft crashed on landing and was returned to TsAGI for repair. three months later a slightly modified ANT took to the air again to complete its trials. The plane achieved a maximum speed of  Kph at m and a service ceiling of m.gtgtImage gtThe second prototype powered by two hp HispanoSuiza engines was slightly different to the initial prototype. Owing to the greater weight of the engines the wingspan was increased but little else was changed. On December th  the aircraft made its maiden flight attaining a maximum speed of  Kph at m this was greatly in excess of the initial specifications as was the service ceiling which increased to m however minor technical issues still affected reliability of the machine.gtgtThe ANT would go on to see production in  becoming known as the SB a simple nomenclature describing it as a Fast Bomber with  engines the aircraft would continue to see many different designs features and power plants over the coming years. Many of these improved types would see service in the Spanish Civil War and see use in many other countries. However when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in  it was hopelessly outclassed by newer aircraft on both sides of the conflict. Nothing however could take away from the aircrafts pioneering design and service to the Soviet Union the SB and the men and women that flew it truly earned their place in history .gtgtAaron Anglomanii Lentz gtgt Discuss on the Forums  gtThis is a bot. | Suggestions?

2171048,0,t1_clfo3b6,Thats a solid and well presented analysis although I dont experience these nuisances in many of the battles I play but I dont have issues with the km rule currently.But I understand it can cause problems like the ones you mentioned. Maybe bringing back proxy spotting could help.What Id really like is that the RB meta would gradually mutate to something in the lines of the Guardian Angel event airstarts for everybody no need to climb for several minutes clear objectives you dont need to spend time looking for the enemy because you already know where they are timelimited objectives spending much time climbing becomes counterproductive because you would be letting the enemy slip by completing their objective resulting in a loss for you.I can actually imagine these kinds of engagements within a big map with several of these happening simultaneously as in the early comments developers made about a new upcoming game mode the one weve been calling World War Mode. Matches wouldnt end in a win or loss after a few minutes but a persistent mission would be in place for a long time e.g. hours and individual engagements within the session would determine a minor win or lose based on local objective completion. After that you can go to the airfield to replenish and move to another objective area to continue or if you get shot down queue again or maybe multiple spawns.I think Id enjoy something like that very much and perhaps that would help solve most of the problems we are havingdiscussing now.,Warthunder,clfshv8,3,t5_2uc6j

As a pretty dedicated bomber killer when I play AB aint nothing better to get me off my quarry than having them drop five kilometers in as many seconds. Also dropping it low ensures that you get away from the players with the presence of mind to climb and land in the realm of the particular dudes who prefer lawnmowing. Know that the Arcade flight models allow any fighter with a reasonable climbrate to get above you with a modicum of patience no matter how hard you climb. Flying towards the objective is also a great way to get killedthat means youre also flying directly at the interceptors who are more than happy to climb up and kill your ass. Climb to the side. Dont fucking try to fight them off with gunners in those bombers German bombers seem to have loaded marshmallows in their belts instead of Minengeschoss. Dont think Ive been shot down more than a few times by a German bomber and its usually because of a very lucky pilot snipe or fuel ignition.Also if you see a MiGBK run. Fucking run to the edge of the map. MiGs were born and bred to wreck shit at high altitudes and the BK has the most forwardfiring guns of any homegrown Soviet fighter.

2268541,0,t1_cls0ees,Well i wonder how physically realistic do does reflections have to be?Do they have to be reduced by haze for example?The thing is how hard it often is to spot planes against the ground is an issue that makes the game less realistic as it often as other here have already explained makes energy fighting tactics that worked perfectly fine in reality impossible in WT. Which turns into a huge problem for planes that rely on such tactics to be successful.I personally think that not many people would mind if a possible solution for this would not by  in line with the laws of optics.Now I am somewhat new to SB myself at least compared to many veterans so I can of course not speak for the SB community.And as I have said in the video my knowledge of D engines is limited and I can therefor not provide to many suggestions on how to improve this issues myself.However there are certainly many other SB players that do have a much better knowledge about this issue than I have and I am certain they have suggestions on how to introduce those reflections properly or other ideas on what to do about this problem.After all this issues is being discussed on the SBfrb forums since long before I started playing.I am sure there would be good suggestions coming from the SB Forum community.

2280080,0,t3_2la4fq, Low rewards the most obvious issue. Rounds end too quickly especially in singlecap maps. Planes in GFAB are gimmicky most of the time and outright break the flow of the game in lowplayer battles. The spotting mechanics are too basic gives you instant highlights on sight but you cant relay positions to teammates quickly.  Spawn points static throughout the whole match fine in Air when you can bee line it quickly but too often not worth respawning in Ground. I and my friends too tried really hard to get into Ground Forces. But it is simply a flawed diamond that begs to be fixed but is not deserving of anyones patience when Air Forces is a more complete game. ,Warthunder,cltjasy,1,t5_2uc6j

Cue  minutes of nothing while I fly towards him but Im amped and have altitude so Im ready for combat. As they both come into view I position myself to boom em hard.Then.......

2287047,0,t3_2lff6i,RBArmament The armament is arguably best in the game of  mm.cal in a stable shooting platform with plenty of ammo with the guns located in the wing roots and nose creating a very small cone of fire. The cannons are inaccurate stock like with all HispanoM cannons but once upgraded they becomes laser pointers with great shell velocity. While the fuses seem off currently against the tail and fuselage in game since . theyll decimate wings.PerformanceWith Pratt amp Whitney RW Double WaspPs engine making around hp each in a relatively light aerodynamic platform you play it like a race horse. Out climb everything including LF Spit IXs and youll never go below kmh unless pulling a split S to re align an attack. If you ever find yourself in trouble just run away. No prop youll face will be able to catch you at sea level. Now youd figure being a twin engine fighter youd bleed this energy fast after the dive? At the moment the FF has some of the best energy retention of the tier IV props it seems even competing with the LA. Just never turn with the FF after an attack extend and then either yoyo or split S.OppositionWith its current BR  as well as USs tendency to fight every nation the different types of planes youll be flying against is extremely high.Japan Everything from AMs too NKjKis. If the MM gods have blessed you and end up top BR against some zeroes if you die you should feel bad. Just keep your speed extremely high dont be afraid of headons and never take it into the horizontal. Try and keep your speed above kmh and you should have trouble shooting fish in a bucket.If against NK Js and Kis climb and never dive on a target unless you see an escape route. Even though you can out run them they accelerate as fast as you and can get some shots offNks are also never afraid to spray with their large ammo countJust play patiently and youll be fine though.GermanyYoull out climb every single thing Germany has currently or just start at k and make your job easier. Even though be cautious because an Me whos not afraid to stall can land some shots on you. If you see no Mes fly to where the Germans climb and tell your team what aircraft and where. Then I usually tend to dive on the last aircraft in the line and again use the great speed and energy retention to BZ. The difference between the Germans and the Japanese is the German have aircraft that can keep up with you in a dive. If a Dora follows you to deck extend until around kmh and then start doing quick bursts of  degree climb until kmh. then level out and rinse and repeat. Similar tactic used on the Mig when a Saber is on your tail and works just as well.Overall While currently BRd way too low and with an airstart this plane is currently toxic for the game. While facing Zeroes who shouldwould have no chance youd feel bad if it wasnt for the fact Japan has arguably the best RB pilots.Even then you should feel bad When you get the chance to Face DsNKs and TempIIs does this plane really feel great to fly though. This plane has very few weak points that can be exploited by the enemy while being best in class in quite a few. The whole plane feels like a prop version of the Mig with the focus being on diveclimb energy retention and an armament that is guaranteed to kill. Facing early props could be a lot of fun as well if its BR is bumped up some and I dont say that about props other then the TempII. I have a feeling it would club Migs ILs Mk met and while being a challenge for Sea Jesus.TLDR Best US prop imo needs a BR boost and airstart removed. Blast to play though,Warthunder,clue9bb,15,t5_2uc6j

2342557,0,t3_2m5rz6,The Renderer and Instancing options mostly affect performance.The Renderer option choses what graphics API to render with.You can choose between DX DXex a DX mode for DX hardware WinXP DX or OpenGLAuto chooses DX DXex or WinXP in that order of preference  the highest your card and OS supports. On Windows one of the different DX renderers runs the best simply because Gaijin has spent more time developing those  the OpenGL renderer is new and Gaijin havent yet gotten it up to the same performance as the others.Try one of the DX renderers and see which one runs the best for you and which has the fewest bugs. Some people will assume the DX is the best but this is not true for all cards and configurations  try them.Instancing is also a performance option  one option runs better on some cards and the other runs better on others. They should look exactly the same. Choose the one with the better performance.For quality there is only the graphics options and postFX options available in the game and launcher which is quite many compared to other games  props to Gaijin for thatYou can extend those with SweetFX which I make  rSweetFX has download links.  The current .. version only works with War Thunders DXex and WinXP renderers but the new . version Im developing at the moment will work with all the renderers and offer a lot of new cool options for graphics improvement.,Warthunder,cm1937c,2,t5_2uc6j
2343315,0,t1_cm19t6a,I will have to correct you on that. I prefer the Meteor F. The F can already climb with half upgraded Mig s and has better high altitude performance than the Venom. It also turns much more smoothly rather than jerking around which makes it difficult to hit targets. Yes the Venom is a bit faster but upgrade the F and you have one hell of a plane that can easily take out Migs. Often the Meteor is written off by Mig pilots so they often leave them and go for the Venoms as they think they are more of a threat so meteors get a great chance against any opponent. Besides the Meteor F BR isnt likely to change any time soon either whereas the Venom might be changed because US pilots complain so much... cough B cough,Warthunder,cm1cgfh,1,t5_2uc6j

For example APCR can easily hit a tank and pass straight through and out the other side without really hitting anything important whereas on the other hand if you hit the tanks ammo rack you will one shot it. Lots of people over penetrate tanks by using the wrong ammo for the job I would say go into the hanger and take a look at the tanks you will be fighting or using and check out the xray view of the internals of the tanks. Familiarize yourself with armor thicknesses locations of ammo racks weakspots drivers view is often much weaker than the front of the tank and other priority modules that will disable a tank if destroyed. as for rangefinding...

2562909,0,t1_cmst08x,Unfortunately thats not quite the case.I have a feeling Gaijin have implemented some damage model change that requires you to hit particular components on the boat to get it to explode.Hitting elsewhere would indeed technically make the boat take in water however the design of landing craft such as the LCVP is quite resilient to leaks from firearms simply because the waterline is so low. Hitting the sides would just punch holes through the sides. You would need to hit the bottom of the craft.Also Im not at all sure if taking in water and sinking slowly is even possible or implemented in War Thunder so there is that. The landing craft do get destroyed after you hit them enough  Ive destroyed some with AM machine guns  but the problem isnt just that it takes a lot of hits to destroy them its the fact that they shoot back lethally accurate antiaircraft fire if you stabilize your attack run to actually be able to hit them with enough rounds to kill them.Most of the time when I try to attack ground targets that shoot back small caliber AA fire I end up with one hit that gives me an oil leak and forces me to withdraw or sets me on fire.

2619141,0,t3_2pvuf8,All three listed tanks are capable. You want to aim for the driver viewport. This is easy for those guns to pierce and from experience on both sides doing so will either hit an ammo rack or disable the turret controls at the very least. The mm KwK  has trouble with IS armor at about km so you can either try to get closer or fish for that weakspot under fire. The  can get closer much more easily with cover and better exploit the turret damage. The  has a harder time killing outright  but that gun also has the least trouble actually hitting the viewport.

Thats not a description of the aircraft. That says nothing useful about the aircraft.It really seems more about them wanting to shit on an aircraft thats iconic for its great performance and is seen as a pinnacle of the Eras design in order to make Soviet designs look better than wanting to say anything useful regarding the design which is you know the whole point of a description.

I gave my honest opinion which planes are best for jet grinding and therefore talisman would benefit me best if I did buy it. I wont tell him dont buy talismans since it is fairly obvious he intends to buy some anyway. That would be offtopic and condescending of me. I dont know his situation and his reasons so I dont pass judgement on him.

At that range velocity is almost negligible and any hits on that plane and it is either blown up or significantly damaged. Also I dont agree about it being childs play to return fire. If the enemy did end up dodging fire then they had to perform some maneuver which causes a loss in energy. Whoever was the attacker has a solid amount of time to extend and regain altitude. I see your point about the turn fighting but again if youre turn fighting almost any German plane you are not flying it correctly.

2832633,0,t1_cnp3des,gt What is the theoretical limit on building a super giant bomber for bombing JapanGermany? Like I know the spruce goose was pretty big. Why no ten engine giga bombers?On this one Im going to bring up something the other fellows left outEVERY design  aircraft and armored vehicles both  balances three things firepower protection and mobility.For the theoretical megabomber something will have to be traded down in order to increase not only the aircrafts weight all those engines AND the necessary fuel to run them for long ranges but also its ability to deliver ordnance on target halfway through its flight. Youre going to need those engines and they need to be highly efficient. You need to fuel those engines for a long duration flight. They need to be robust enough to survive moderate amounts of damage. They need to be protected. The ship will need a flight crew  how many and at  pounds each? Turrets for protection weigh a lot too  single guns then? How many? How much ammo? Everything you add to the design decreases the ability somewhere else. Guns engines fuel crew some measure of armor... okay you give up some payload.Ultimately the advent of jet technology made it possible for aircraft to fly those longer distances and as those engine designs improved on fuel efficiency you got better and better range out of them. But a B today still requires a lot of runway and carries very little if any defensive armament in the manner of crewserved handoperated guns. Some BUFFs still have tail guns but the concept of turrets like on the B  etc is done.,Warthunder,cnq2dm4,2,t5_2uc6j

2844404,0,t1_cnrcjmr,IS doesnt fight T. Theyre on the same team. T is effectivelly faster less armored IS and its BR and combat capabilities reflect that rather good  T sacrifices a bit of that mobility in favor of a bit better protection but they both bounce nonAPCR shots very effectively to the point where its more scary to meet JagdPanzer IV or PzIVJH than it is to face Tiger or Panther D both lack APCR Tiger can try to use HEAT at longer ranges to bypass  bounce chance issue. Other than that BR system is setup in such way that tanks on contemporary BR can penetrate each other frontally whether theyre medium heavy or light tanks this doesnt apply to T because ISM doesnt care. T as well as IS can and will penetrate Tiger I and Panther D up to like m range  that why they received APCR in recent update T had it earlier if I recall correctly IS gor APCR just now on top of APCR massive buff  bounce chance at  degrees. As medium tank you trade your defensive capabilities for better mobility. T DT or T need to flank Tiger or shoot at ranges below m to penetrate it frontally with their APHEAPHEBC but then again they have significantly lower battlerating theyre expected to struggle in that matchup  yet they still can kill their superior enemy if they get close enough and its not close as in bad breathclose or easily at up to m if they attack from the side. Now with map spotting gone theres no reason to give medium tanks special treatment  theyre supposed to flank and exploit their mobility meanwhile players expect that their medium tank will go toe to toe against heavy tank which actually happens in War Thunder outside of few very rare cases. edit Before you ask about teams consisting  of Tigers vs teams consisting in majority of inferior tanks  its issue of the matchmaking as were not in RB and theres only  tank of choice joining the battle yet MM doesnt care just dump .BR range into the same battle.

Unlocked it as soon as I could and only then went for Panther D. You can kill pretty much anything you come across and if you play it right you shouldnt have a problem with it. Just make sure you keep enemies at hand and you should be good. I didnt really have problems with Ms and their SABOTs yet but might be just luck.

They have the US ground forces trickling into the game so I think players will be satisfied for a while leaving them to work on optimising the game. Once that is done then they can make foliage a mandatory graphics feature.I do agree with you and several other people that there needs to be a limit on planes in each game.

There is nothing more than a proposal to mount the mm in the Tiger II. The guns breech was deemed too large to fit inside the turret while retaining the space for the loader to handle the twopiece ammunition so the project never moved forward. Im not sure if it could have been mashed inside the turret rings space if the turret itself was modified a la Sherman Firefly but the Tiger II mit KwK as it appears in War Thunder is an impossibility.Per the name of the gun the mm KwK  is also a fantasy weapon the numeric designation suggests it would have been created in .

2894380,0,t3_2t9z2a,I know the OP was mostly a rant post but Ill add some additional information.Dont fly directly at the enemy bases when you spawn. If the sun is off to one side pick the side that its on and fly towards it. Youre harder to spot both your dot and the range at which the games spotting system will highlight you. if you have the sun at your back.Climb while traveling to one side. Being the first bomber to the base only to die to enemy fighters that are climbing isnt useful. Find your bombers optimal climb airspeed and keep to it while climbing.Give the fighters time to work. It takes  WEP cycles for even a fastclimbing plane to reach bomber spawn altitude and maneuvering for a kill can take even longer than that. Just because your teams fighters have reached your altitude doesnt mean they can instantly obliterate the enemy.Dont expect to see fighters flying in fingertip formation with you. A fighter sticking to a bomber is just two kills in one pass. If theyre doing their job properly and keeping you safe they should be off ahead of you killing any fighters that are trying to climb to meet you.Dont expect your team to always gain air superiority. In fact dont expect it more than half the time. If your team doesnt have air superiority youre going to need to fend for yourself. Dont fly straight and level. If you dont have heavy fixed forward armament never take head on passes. If you do have heavy forward guns Ju D any model of B and the BA are some examples of such aircraft. always force head on passes. In any case fly aggressively. Act like a fighter. You wont be able to outturn a fighter in the long run and you wont be able to out energy fight them unless theyre spectacularly bad. But the longer you make them work for it the more likely you are to score a lucky gunner hit and the more likely the other bombers on your team are to get through.Fly together. Not in pretty formations but in close support range so that one bomber who comes under attack and starts maneuvering can then have other bombers swoop in to help. Three or four Bs all flying like heavy fighters represent a lot of . cal in the air and the forward armament is a severe threat. Even a fairly nimble fighter will have a hard time dodging all that lead and lining up a kill shot at the same time.EditOne tactic I forgot to mention is the climbing spiral Its not effective against smart fighter pilots who will simply climb above you and drop on you with more energy but it works excellently to sap energy from fighters who simply helicopter up to shoot at you. If youre good and balance it very carefully you can even set up a situation where stupid pilots will chase you endlessly inside your gunner range without ever having a clean shot.Its not guaranteed to work and it requires a pretty good judgement of your opponents energy but when you get everything set up right you can practically see the frustration boiling out of the opposing fighter.That said all of the defensive maneuvering  Ive discussed only works against pilots who engage without a significant energy advantage. Even groups of bombers flying aggressively are vulnerable to extremely high speed passes. If you run into someone who climbs k above you before rolling in you havent got much of a chance as theyre holding all the cards. The best you can do for your team in that situation is draw out the fight and make it take as long as possible to kill you giving other bombers more time to do their job. Make yourself a diffcult target jink and turn constantly. If youre flying a low BR bomber you can still soak a significant amount of MG ammo as long as its spread amongst multiple locations. Dont make it easy for a fighter to line up a concentrated burst into a wing root or tail surfaces. Even a little bit of relative motion dramatically decreases the accuracy of incoming fire.,Warthunder,cnx3f53,4,t5_2uc6j

2948609,0,t1_co2bpks,gt By lowering the sensitivity you get an artificial delay till the point you reach full given input. That way you get less abrupt ingame movements from a bit too sudden joystick ones.gt gt gt gt By increasing nonlinearity you also get a sensitivitycurve thats less sensitive around the center and more sensitive around the edges. That makes fine control and aiming easier but makes full throw on the joystick even more abrupt than otherwise.Thanks for explaining. Tinkering with the settings is much easier when you know at least what it is you are adjusting. gtTinker a little with post processing settings ingame. Increasing sharpness a bit can help spotting increasing it A LOT helps even more but Im not responsible for any eyebrain damage that occurs from that experience.And this seems to make the initial spotting easier indeed.

3027667,0,t1_cobmlar,Sometimes I wonder what the heck the developers were thinking when they chose some of these cap points and spawns or perhaps the problem is they werent.  Mozdok is all around terrible.  The single cap point at Karelia at the bottom of the map either side is a joke since one team has to fight through choke points.  The Jungle when its a single cap point on the hill in the middle of the map favors the Western team although better than the old map.  In RB at White Rock there is a single point where one team is so close to the spawn vs. the other team its a joke.  I am sure there are others I cant think of right now but there are some horrible capture point and spawn setups.  I cant understand how anyone thought they were good to start with and even worse how they are still in the game.  They have to know they suck.  I would rather play the same maps over and over again than play the bullshit modes where one side wins close to  of the time.  They dont even have to wait to take the time to redesign them.  Just remove them from the game until they figure out new spawns and cap point.  Why continue to have us play on shit setups?,Warthunder,cobtddr,1,t5_2uc6j

3059656,0,t1_coey2ve,Depending on what modules and crew you hit it can have very little effect on the tanks overall performance. Commanders dont really do much right now nor do radio operators and machine gunners. Knocking out optics blocks is pointless.You should memorize the following locations for any tank you expect to fight Driver gunner ammunition racks transmission. The first two are critical crew. The game will shuffle any other crew around to keep those slots filled so if you can kill one of those two positions you can slowly crew kill an entire tank. Ammunition racks will explode and destroy the entire tank when sufficiently damaged. Transmission damage will immobilize the tank and dramatically reduce its ability to maneuver once it does repair it also has a high chance of starting a fire.Survivabilitywise dont take a full load of ammo ever. For most tanks more than  or  rounds will simply be adding more explodium to your tank.  rounds should last you a match if you have good marksmanship and will dramatically reduce your chances of being racked and killed instantly. To find the exact load you should take go into a test drive or custom battle and experiment with ammo quantities to note where the breakpoints that empty certain racks are.On the Pz. III I recommend emptying everything except the last two or three racks thus reducing your vulnerability to a narrow strip of ammo on the floor behind the machine gunner. On the Pz. IVs I recommend emptying everything except the right side. Ammunition on the left side of your tank makes getting shot in the driver port a massive hazard.When engaging dont fuck around with armor angling in the open. Get hull down. Armor angling is all nice and fine if you have to get shot in the hull and you should absolutely angle if you dont have a choice about being engaged but you should never ever be looking to get shot in the hull in the first place. Terrain is better than any armor you have on your tank.Dont stand and brawl. If someone gets you ranged in get the hell out. Back down the slope and reposition. Even if you know that they cant pen your armor they can still damage your gun barrel and breech as well as damaging and possibly penetrating your turret ring.When you get the chance to open fire first dont rush your shot. Pick exactly what you want to hit wait until you have a guaranteed hit then pull the trigger. If youre worried about return fire jam their turret traverse blow their gun breech or kill their gunner. But be aware that killing their gunner will require that you keep killing his replacements. Im fond of going for a turret traversetransmission onetwo combo when using fastfiring guns if I dont feel I can reliably pick off an ammo rack in the first shot.Try and stack up multiple targets. For example when picking off the turret traverse try and put the shot through the turret ring and into the gunner. Bonus points for nailing the gun breech too. Shots through the transmission and into the driver are the same deal with a good angle and a bit of luck you can hit the feet of the turret crew as well or have the round traverse the whole tank to score a transmission driver engine triple hit. Obviously this only works on frontdrive tanks.,Warthunder,cof4pjt,5,t5_2uc6j

I keep trying to get my AM stay above the P forcing him to use his speed to keep me at bay.He eventually turns around which I juke by doing a inversed halfbarrel roll and turn under his plane.

For example if you lineup of tanks is all .. and you suddenly unlock a .  dont use it unless you are prepared to only play with one tank.

3143377,0,t1_connscg,Oleg walked during the whole Cliffs of Dover bs. IGrab a coffee or a beer and check this  thread at simHQ. He had a good run and the il series will always be revered CloD just fell apart but the fusion crew have brought it back from the depths into a much better game than the crew working on it could ever have done. Bad management bungled release  shit patchs that did nothing far reaching and shifting goals that no one was interested in like a ground forces option with mannable AA vehicles and such. They even modelled shock absorbers on vehicles. Clickable cockpits that an extreme vocal minority had to have.  It was fun times on release month..if you didnt laugh you would have cried Here is good wrap up by that old Champion Fearless Frog on the MaddoxCloD saga.. The game is really inconsistent as in the bad parts are really bad but the good parts are actually really good. This basically means it polarizes opinions. Example Ive never had an issue with performance but can empathize with those that do but at the end of the day its not a problem I see. When I do get bad performance I rage. MG are really really slow at fixing things so while any community has haters and fanboys most of the normal people are getting bored and have lost interest now. As nature abhors a vacuum that just leaves the obsessives or trolls to party as middleground people usually want no part of the conversations they see here. C is to healthy community communication as Josef Mengeles was to the art of paediatrics. They havent got a clue and generally do the exact wrong thing. It provides new angles at which to wack the dead horse every couple of weeks or so. Keeps the stew simmering. People hate change. Some people got IL working just right on Windows XP and always saw CloD as a threat i.e. the shiny arrogant usurper. Lots of bloated promises from foreign sounding people that should get theirs in the end etc. It uses Steam.

3235515,0,t1_cox6ael,The Ho.  V never flew yes but the H. IX V Jumo Jet powered and the H. IX V Unpowered glider both flew and were flight tested.gt The first prototype H.IX V an unpowered glider with fixed tricycle landing gear flew on  March . Flight results were very favorable but there was an accident when the pilot attempted to land without first retracting an instrumentcarrying pole extending from the aircraft. The design was taken from the Horten brothers and given to Gothaer Waggonfabrik. The Gotha team made some changes They added a simple ejection seat dramatically changed the undercarriage to enable a higher gross weight changed the jet engine inlets and added ducting to aircool the jet engines outer casing so as to prevent damage to the wooden wing.gtThe H.IX V was followed in December  by the Junkers Jumo powered second prototype H.IX V the BMW  engine was preferred but unavailable. Gring believed in the design and ordered a production series of  aircraft from Gothaer Waggonfabrik with the RLM designation Ho  even though it had not yet taken to the air under jet power. The first flight of the H.IX V was made in Oranienburg on  February .gtAll subsequent test flights and development were done by Gothaer Waggonfabrik. By this time the Horten brothers were working on a turbojetpowered design for the Amerika Bomber contract competition and did not attend the first test flight. The test pilot was Leutnant Erwin Ziller. Two further test flights were made between  and  February . Another test pilot used in the evaluation was Heinz Scheidhauer.gtThe H.IX V reportedly displayed very good handling qualities with only moderate lateral instability a typical deficiency of tailless aircraft. While the second flight was equally successful the undercarriage was damaged by a heavy landing caused by Ziller deploying the brake parachute too early during his landing approach. There are reports that during one of these test flights the H.IX V undertook a simulated dogfight with a Messerschmitt Me  the first operational jet fighter and that the H.IX V outperformed the Me .,Warthunder,coxd8vw,2,t5_2uc6j

3246584,0,t3_2xange,Ok honest opinion not very good. I was hoping for some original content and humor but its mostly a rehash of the same things you see here all the time.Unfortunately the humor doesnt rise above the level of memes. And memes are the easiest laziest ways to try and get a laugh. Its almost a stretch to categorize them as humor. So get rid of the would x again and about  of the Soontm s and if you want to make a joke about bias dont just say bias or use stalinium try to be original come up with something that makes both the writer and the reader think and that may actually put a smile on some faces.Now I realise my comment is a bit harsh but you asked for feedback and Im trying to help. Half of the things you write were probably also said today here on reddit. And the other half probably somewhere last week. Its pretty much a collection of typical comments rather than original content.Maybe try a completely different perspective. Not a global overview of the game but start with the story of a match. It can be a made up match. Or describe a war scene which eventually becomes a scene from the game and from there you go on to review the game. Or the other way around. Or a new player experience. Or write from the perspective of an AI pilot. Or ... I hope you get the point.And I dont know if youre a native speaker and its more about the writing or if English is a second language and its more about correct use of English but either way my criticism on originality stands. If you are an English speaker and its about the writing you shouldnt start sentences with I mean ... thats ok for spoken language and forum posts but not very literary. Also this one is a bit messy Regarding gameplay the flight models weapons and physics are according to the developers ... and dont mix its and it is. For a more literary text never use its but most of all be consequent and dont use its in one sentence and it is in the next paragraph.One last thing if you use abbreviations that are not very common or specific to the topic the first time you use them indicate what they mean and that from there on y means x AI Artificial Intelligence  bots and Battle Rating BR.Hope it helps.,Warthunder,coyilye,7,t5_2uc6j

While you put all your effort into making it as great as you can you see how its never enough for plenty of people and all they do is always ask for more while insulting all of your efforts to make it better.

3423653,0,t3_2zfsr2,The wobble is probably an issue with the specific plane youre using P some planes have near arcadelevel Instructor handling while others suffer the wobble.As for crew skills I believe they help. Invest in Gforces reduce blackout when youre turning onto target at high speed and Stamina improves handling when pulling gforces. Or at least I think thats what they do.As for general BnZ tips there are a ton but I dont have much time to type. Try going for multiple passes until the enemy is too slow to turn away in time. Or slow down yourself by going for shallower booms and cutting back on throttle so you have more time to position yourself. Try predicting where the enemy will turn in your vertical zoom and roll in that direction before rediving to catch them. Lock onto your target and use the ltAltgt key to keep track of his maneuvers while youre in your zoom so you can position yourself and predict his movement. The BEST tip however is watching someone experienced do it. I almost ragequit realistic because I couldnt figure our the damn P which was my first real BnZ plane. Watching videos by MagzTV helped immensely because hes an experienced pilot and talks you through all his maneuvers. After a while youll subconsciously pick up his moves and playing style which Ive found has helped me a ton.,Warthunder,cpiisg5,3,t5_2uc6j

Before I get down voted to oblivion let me point out a few flaws. Late war soviet fighters against MidWar spitfires and American planes. Captured premium planes including LendLease aircraft with the FM of a damn UFO. Incomplete FMs on the Jap team that everybody uses to club at around tier .. The B and who knows what other planes have astronomical repair rates and the FM hasnt been updated in over a year! The grind continues to be extended when they think its not long enough seriously asshats just add more fucking planes and tanks or mapswhatever instead of someone having to spend  hours of straight game time just to unlock the first upgrade. Planes with FMs so horrible that its actually easy to just fix in a few hours and release an update the day after bug testing.TLDR fuck the TLDR get your lazy ass back up there and read the damn wall of text. Im not asking you to sacrifice your damn mother or your firstborn child.Im tired of War Thunder its fucking depressing and now Im playing WoT.

3505949,0,t3_30ez5n,I have it and have used it to grind in arcade.  It has a great gun. You only have APCBC and HE so when you get up tiered it wont be as fun.  Three of your crew are in a line with a nice flat mm of armor in front of them that is the reason it is at a lower BR than the Panzer IVV.  If you look around you can find spots to go hull down and protect the flat frontal armor.  That being said I used it to earn .K RP in arcade to help the grind.  Have used it in the sim events It lacks speed so setup ambushes at the longer ranges it is harder for the enemy to hit the weaker flat frontal armor.  Since you are already in rank III I would say grind the panzer IVs to get the tiger H and panther D.  ,Warthunder,cprwit2,2,t5_2uc6j

Forgot people expect fp games to be done quick so they can bitch about nothing at the endgame. The grind for the last stuff is long and I like it because it brings with it a sense of accomplishment to get into jets and then get them all unlocked and aced.And rewards are nice. Im not terribly pissed if I lose a bunch of games with a  or  boost and I can spread them out over a number of nations. before I only got one boost a day per nation. Now if I want to concentrate on one I can keep getting some form of boost to it.Also means I can start the day recklessly not having to worry about doing poorly and then winning wasting a massive x for the next  hours.

3511610,0,t3_30hae0,Try putting yourself purposefully into bad situations. A few months ago when all I played was the Chaika Id try to get into v situations then v and so on just to see how far I could go before the numbers were overwhelming. Id go straight into the center furball. Id get into as many headons as possible turning at the very last minute. Really risky stuff like that. Another fun thing is to take lowtier aircraft into high tiers. Ive found that the Chaika is competitive all the way up to early tier IV. The only bad thing about it is that the Chaika teaches a lot of bad habits the only thing you can really do in it is turn and burn which isnt that good of a strategy for nations other than Japan because you bleed off all of your energy.Also SB is fun to get into.

3542298,0,t1_cpw0btc,im not sure what the BRs of all the american tanks are currently but i do know my . BR tigers are constanly fighting Ts and Ms.  Both of which are postwar tanks that the tiger  never saw in battle.  sometimes i also will run into a is as well or walker bulldog.  The T is fine as it went into production in .  The m walker bulldog didnt even go into production until .overal tanks have a harder matchmaking problem due to the fact that armor basically makes some tanks invulnerable  to other tanks in certain situations.  while in planes some have more firepowermanuverability or are harder to kill but its still possible.  in any case this feeling is incredibly frustrating when you are on the losing side. To be honest it feels to me more like some of the american tanks have hitbox issues as i can hit a side  rear of a turret dead on with APCR and bounce  of the time.  Or i can pen the side with APHE and do zero critical damage. im not sure if there is a goodfair solution to this issue.  non symetrical gameplay is nearly impossible to balance and it seems that all the nations have balance issues at different BRs. I do think that the st thing that needs to be done is reduce game BR spreads.   BR spreads is too much for nearly all vehicles in every game mode. ,Warthunder,cpw1m48,1,t5_2uc6j

3689838,0,t1_cqcuh80,AFAIK the primary effects of MW on temperature would be a reduction in the actual combustion temperature inside the pistons plus the reduced load on the coolant system as you mention. If you had this alone then you would actually reduce temperature for a given power setting but when you tack on  hp your net heat is up. You are right that the limit was usually the amount of MW  though some of that is certainly attributable to the significant amount of abuse that the engines took in combat on all sides.gt Either way the official limit was  minutes of continuous use for MW and that is certainly well beyond what we can currently use in War Thunder for any aircraft equipped with MW system. agree with you there it seems many planes have very short WEP times for no particularly good reason. Does not apply to the LF Spitfire unfortunately that might be a bit short too but not for this reason pure power increase without watermethanol increase gives big heat increase.gtThis appears to be correct but as far as I know you could still control the power in the  band where the MW system was active.Also true and also an issue on many planes. Far too may planes have no adequate modeling of their respective boost systems which is annoying.Overall Id say that engine modeling both heating and boost is the  issue with plane FMs right now.  is probably a distinctive lack of shake and rattle or feel in general of aircraft but thats much harder to get right than something with clear sources available pretty much everywhere.,Warthunder,cqcv6pm,2,t5_2uc6j

3758203,0,t1_cqknj2k,For SB Id actually recommend postponing some performance unlocks for the benefit of decent ground attack munitions. You never know when they can turn a battle.Just a while ago I won a battle with my Spitfire Mk.XVIII by rocketattacking enemy tanks in a total of three or four flyouts. The enemy bombers got a solid lead by basebombing but then either died or went into hiding and without my rockets wed have lost.Same with my Typhoon where bombing destroyers saved the day.Most of the time you just need one or two ground attack upgrades and you have a good enough payload for it to matter. Can take the remaining ones last. On the Typhoon it feels like a nobrainer considering how amazingly good the plane is anyway.,Warthunder,cqknv1v,2,t5_2uc6j
3758295,0,t3_338y0o,People bring this up quite often and I still hold the same belief no WT does not have a Russian bias. Its just that their aircraft and tanks are generally advantageous in the most common of WTs circumstances.In arcade battles for example most aircraft flight models are basically UFOs. So when you have a YakK flying around and oneshotting people with infinite mm cannon rounds while outturning everything thanks to the lowlevel clusterfuck that AB tends to be its only natural that people are gonna get pissed. No one likes getting oneshot in any game regardless of the setting or genre. Historically Russian aircraft were best at low altitudes anyway. BnZ is a great tactic to use for energy fighters but the usually short round times and lack of incentive for playing cautiously in AB just mean that German and American players end up down at the deck where they get outturned and slaughtered by giant Russian cannons. I dont see as much of a problem with Russian planes in RB because the kind of players who know their aircraft in RB are typically a step above someone who only plays AB.As far as tanks are concerned its more of a matter of the silly RNG bounce system that makes lowtier sloped armor practically fucking invincible. Its disheartening to come across a T pump mm shots into it repeatedly and get destroyed in return for your troubles.Again though German tanks early in the war did tend to have worse armor and weaker guns. The reason the Germans could wipe the floor with superior tanks in larger numbers at least early on came from a number of factors namely inexperienced Russian crews poor visibility and nonexistent communication between Russian tanks which led to poor tactics and build quality that left something to be desired.None of that can be properly implemented into WT without pissing off a lot of people though. So if you grind up the German line youre stuck with shit armor and popgun cannons until you hit the higher tiers. Especially if youre unfortunate enough to play AB ground where tactics and maneuvering mean absolutely nothing.tldr No Russian bias just circumstances that benefit Russian aircraft and tanks in the more arcadey modes.Thats my . rubles.,Warthunder,cqko8no,2,t5_2uc6j

3774839,0,t1_cqmiv1c,The soft cap does turn the shell towards the armor but the resultant forces on the lower nose are still high enough to turn it away later on.If APC was driven towards the armor during the entire penetration itd penetrate less armor than the LoSthickness which is not the case.The image is based upon this a report by the British. The shell is driven away at first then towards the plate but the total path is longer. Heres another one against thicker armor.For APC have a look at these spark photographs by the Germans Image  shows that the shell turns towards the plate then away from it in image  then towards it again in image . This path due to it being driven away in image  is still longer than the LoSthickness but shorter than that of an AP shot.So yes APC does a better job at defeating sloped armor than AP.

3809301,0,t1_cqqfpxx,FYI those limitations are due to the M browning being a closed bolt gun.When not firing a round is in the chamber and the bolt is forward.This means that if the barrel is too hot heat from the barrel will be conducted into the round thats currently chambered and the round will cook off causing uncommanded firing.Cookoff is slow a few minutes per round. Regardless you dont want to let a gun get so hot that it cooks off rounds.In any case its not a matter of the gun getting damaged if fired for reasonably longer than those limits. Basically they are operationalproceduralpolitical limits more than mechanical limits the understanding that firing more than the limit does not mean firing thousands of rounds more all at once  because that much heat would cause aggrivated barrel wear.scheherazade,Warthunder,cqqhock,4,t5_2uc6j

3888388,0,t1_cqzeb0m,gt If they wouldnt get it they wouldnt have a chance to get alt andor get to the target to drop the bombs. Youll either get shot down really easilly or the match is going to end before you get to drop the bombs.Im not against an air start for large level bombers. However they need to start far away enough to be possible to find and intercept before they bomb. Unfortunately most of WTs maps bar Moscow and Spain I guess are too small for that.gt Well how else could you implement the gunners then? The turret guns were pretty easy to point at the enemy plane and way easier to aim than a whole plane.Just remove manual gunner control. Done. Bombers shouldnt be gunships anyway. Let the AI do the gunning.gt How? Like I said its realistic that you can shoot the guns more easily than to fly a whole plane.Depends. In straight and level flight the guns should be pretty easy to aim. Especially if someone tails you straight behind. However aiming turretshandaimed guns in a plane pulling Gs certainly gets harder than firing fixed forwardfiring guns. Also got to think of that it wasnt until VERY late in the war that gunnerweapons more than on a select few positions in a select few models got holographic sights to help with the parallax effect of aiming.gt The problem here is mainly the alt. Its way easier to aim the bombs from k than from k. And how easy was it IRL? The bombadier told the pilot to where to steer and you could get pretty accurate even without a sophisticated bombsight. Now with for example a Norden bombsight the bombing was even easier. The problem the sight brought was that the bombers in the formations started crashing into each other when the bombadiers tried to aim for the target then they just let the lead bomber aim and the rest of the bombers dropped their bombs somewhere and that really inflated the stats.Even with the Norden bomb sight the accuracy was quite awful a big reason being that the bombs themselves were quite awful for accuracy. Thats one of the reasons they needed so many bombers per mission if they had to bomb from more than like m. However it was far less awful than without the sight in which case it was outright atrocious.Pretty accurate really depends on the target. If talking about the strategic objective size targets ingame not many bombs would hit if a whole plane box formation of Bs dropped at it from m.gt This is true but still the strategic bombing targets are better than going for a tank column for instance.Agreed. Still dumb but less dumb than before.gt Yeah but the autopilot is just there to either level the bomber or just to fly it straight. I dont really see why you thing this is a prublem.Autopilot in itself isnt an issue for me. It existed already back then. Coupled with mouseaim gunners it is too OP though.gt Yes this should be adressed aswell. Like in SB heavy bombers should be like double reward. And you dont really need an hour to get to position if youre alone and the maps are big enough to maneuver around the bomber sufficently enough if its not like a B at high alt which is fast or a jet bomber.Certainly agreed on extra reward. And actually  yes. You may need that hour. If a plane only has a say... kph on a bomber it can take quite a while to get in a good position. A good position probably is km ahead of the bomber. Then you turn and attack headon probably wont kill it because of having to break off far away you again work to get km ahead and repeat. Worst Ive done was AM against Bs. Had to spend  minutes per attack just to reposition and even then it was almost suicide each attack.gt Yeah but neither can fighters. Shouldnt fighter be in a formation if not in combat too?Preferably  yes. But fighters already stick together to a higher degree than bombers so they are in the right direction.gt Well of course you should if there are enough bombers and you can easilly attack them but chasing an empty bomber is something you really should have as your first priority in SB.Well that I can agree on. Empty bombers are always a lower priority.gt Well what was a good CoD then?Personally I think MW was the best assuming custommodded servers that removed some of the perks. I really loathe the killstreak stuff and other... ADHD and reward system feeding designs and scraping some of that off I certainly enjoyed what MW had to offer.,Warthunder,cqzidah,3,t5_2uc6j

3925490,0,t1_cr3prx0,The american probably started diving from a greater height or had a higher speed than you when initiating the dive. Never stop climbing. Having an altitude advantage is always a good thing. Just make sure you arent going too slowly when climbing so you have some wiggle room if something happens. Every plane has a different optimal climb angle and speed at different heights. Finding out how to climb efficiently in the planes you like will help. If you have a plane like the  that is slow and doesnt climb as well as some single engine fighters your best bet is to not go straight towards the middle of the map but instead go more towards the edges and keep climbing unless you want to do ground attacks.Another very important thing is situational awareness. Always look around you watching after enemies. Try to take out enemies high up before you take out enemies low down. If you want a plane that gets favourable matchmaking and has a good combination of climbing ability speed and firepower research the Me  E. It can basically outrun any plane it faces in some cases even when at a large energy disadvantage.,Warthunder,cr3qprq,1,t5_2uc6j

I am hoping though that well be seeing it on the JM and AM when they arrive.And the Ho might arguably be the most effecient cannon used during the war in terms of firepower to weight ratio.

The most common usage is during BnZ attacks to avoid overspeeding since the Meteor has a relatively low dive speed limit.

4217609,0,t3_396mj9,As frustrating as bombers are to take down proper interception tactics would ease a lot of it. What I witness in SB matches and what I admittedly do myself is not take the necessary time to setup proper intercepts. So you get these lazy attacks where youre relative speed is hardly any faster or youre just coming right up behind them and just sitting in their gun sights. Getting shot down this way is proper. You fly poorly you perform poorly.That said there should be a couple of changes that could be made to SB bombers to make them less gamey. One is to require manual inputs to the bomb sight for altitude and speed no more automatic computing. You shouldnt be able to jink in your B to dodge a fighter then level off and  seconds later drop bombs with pinpoint precision. Bombers should need to commit more wholly to the bomb run. I get that the bomber and pilot are two separate people and conceivably they could do these things simultaneously IRL but this is a reasonable balancing move.The other and probably harder to code change should be that AI does not shoot while within clouds. I understand why bombers choose to fly in clouds but you shouldnt get to take advantage of not being seen while simultaneously reaping the benefits of being able to see the enemy on account of your AI. Especially when it only take a few well places bullets to set a fighter alight and end their mission.,Warthunder,cs0zoau,0,t5_2uc6j

But if you really want to get to high teir  jets fast the German MiGbis is your best option. Two options to get there . free option. .  option. Free tier  unlock the bf and use it to unlock two more teir  fighters. Teir  unlock six planes and move on all of them are pretty good so it doesnt matter what you pick. Teir  get the bf F and use it to unlock the other  fighters. Teir   get the Fw D and use it to get the remaining fighters  and start researching the he. Use the D to grind out the he and finally the MiG bis.  use  to buy the Dora pack. Youll get the Fw D  Golden Eagles and  days of premium. Use the D premium planes earn over double RP to get six planes at each teir until you can reseach the MiGbis. CONGRATS!  You are now in top teir jets! Unfortunately you know nothing about jet combat so you are competely inexperienced. Get ready to get stomped then complain that this game sucks. And that jets are unbalanced. Tough tits. The grind through all the teirs is meant to teach you to fly and get you experience. Its not there just to delay your fun.  ,Warthunder,cs3nybs,2,t5_2uc6j

On the other hand if you have to just make high speed passes from one side to the other from above you can get unlucky. One time I was making such a pass and right as I crossed the bomber both of my Ps wings were turned to black probably from a single . bullet each.

4303387,0,t1_csaoysa,A matter of efficiency  a fuselage adds drag but contributes no lift.  In fact in a traditional layout some of the lift of the wings is cancelled out by the tail exerting a downward force on the plane.  The tail adds drag and the wings have to be larger than they otherwise would be to overcome the downward force of the tail.    Have the entire structure of the plane contributing lift and you are much more efficient.  Its also why designs with canards like XP are also more efficient than traditional designs  the wings produce lift and the canards exert an upward force on the plane.  ,Warthunder,csapszg,8,t5_2uc6j

4318990,0,t1_cscebc9,Overall you are right but thing about SVT is wrong. They were very unreliable and not accurate. Mosins were actually better for an average soldier. But yes overall Soviet army was much more potent than Germany at the start. Soviets lost most of their weaponry and manpower in first days and weeks. Mainly because of poor command. Some say Soviet plan was to attack the Germany so most of their force was near the border but they also werent prepared for war yet. So Germany supposedly attacked as a preventive strike. This is why WWII games like WT have troubles with balance and people constantly say about russian bias. On paper Soviet weaponry looks much better. And one might wonder how the hell they managed to lose first years of war to Germany having superior ... everything. In reality soviet soldiers have little to no experience after officer purge in late s most of the officers were very young and didnt know what to do higher command was constantly making mistakes.

4328311,0,t1_csd60dq,I flew the Cl for many months used it to unlock the mig. after using the mig  I never returned to the sabre. The MiG has more quirks and takes longer to understand but quite simply it has a powerful engine light airframe and strong cannons and you must use these to your advantage to fight fs. At high altitude k feet if you initially have higher energy you can outrun them. If a f is on you at highspeed dont kill your throttle simply look behind you and never let their nose line up to your plane and you wont get hit  though dont overdue it. Let their nose get as close to you as possible fooling them then jerk your plane the opposite way that they are leaning. It takes practice but the better you get it becomes harder and harder for enemies to hit you at ideal maneuvering  speeds of  mph. The better the enemy the less they will follow your plane and the more they will wait for your plane to line up with their nose. Be diligent. Its similar to never missing a beat the more enemies the more notes to hit to successfully evade. You mess up you will get shot. Ideally your throttle is full the F is on your ass you evade him he overshoots with his higher top speed and throttles back meanwhile you are full throttle the entire time and gain the energy advantage therefore turning the tides of the duel.,Warthunder,csdj39l,1,t5_2uc6j

4411282,0,t1_csmtbrf,I play both RB and SB. IMO the underperformance in RB is for a few reasons. First other planes have an easy time picking out targets. While enemies dont get an RB marker friendlies do. That means any mover without a marker is an enemy. Second in RB you get rd person view which makes finding movers laughably simple in SB you cant sit at k in a FW and just stare down to easily find all of the targets. Lastly not really last just last Ill mention is that in SB the tank view is realistic. In RB if you fly low in a ground attack plane every flipping tank in the game is gunning for you quite accurately. In SB it is really hard for a tank to see you coming let alone attack you.Edit Fixing autocorrect,Warthunder,csmvwuc,2,t5_2uc6j

4440918,0,t3_3bx25y,RBSBMostly SB A few patches ago this plane was a ridiculously overpowered monster but has received first some nerfs then some buffs and sits nicely now. Note that for this first part Ill be talking about the Soviet Premium PA and for the second part the Soviet Premium PA. Yes I have both.Now the PA is a plane with great performance in climb nice speed and pretty good acceleration when the WEP is on. Without WEP its a major turd at this tier. However even without WEP you still enjoy a decent turn rate decent roll rate a very fast dive limit and good energy retention in the vertical and horizontal. It has decent visibility being great to the front with a fantastic gunsight but only middling to poor visibility to the side and rear. The turn rate is better comparatively at high speeds than at low speeds and the flaps do more to slow you down than to help your turn. Keep fights above kmh if not BnZ which it should be. The stall is rather quick and violent but easy to avoid at least if you have cannon ammo its can be squirrelly on low ammo.Now there are two big important tags on this plane.. Have WEP available when entering combat.. The gun is fantastic but takes some getting used to.On  the planes performance is great with WEP but useless without it. Your climb rate acceleration and speed got to absolute shit on  power so always have it available. The engine cools at a decent rate but you can get yourself into trouble quickly without it. It will last long enough for even the longest fights but make sure to have it.On  many people are initially turned off by the gun but it has tons of ammo and will blow shit up  in one hit  every time Im a big fan of larger caliber guns Ill take the MK  over the MG  any day of the week and this is the plane I got my experience on. Its a low velocity mm with only HE rounds available. The low velocity takes some getting used to but my advice is to only ever fire individual shots and keep the same convergence and vertical targeting settings. If youre having troubles aiming switch the .s to stealth belts so those tracers dont mislead you.So PA TLDR Good performance on WEP. Better at high speed and very nice in BnZ. Good visibility forward OK to side and rear. Gun is very powerful but takes practice.As a side note  x . is nothing to joke about either and makes a great backup which leads into the next topic the PA. This plays a lot like a PA with the same good BnZ high speed control and forward visibility but with a heavily neutered WEP. This is essentially exactly what it is too and because of that your playstyle is forced to being more patient and climbingheavy.The cannon has the same ammo and muzzle velocity but a lower rate of fire and much lower ammo capacity. The RoF doesnt really matter as you should be shooting single shots but lower ammo capacity can really bite you in longer fights or when youre just getting used to it. Ive often found myself wishing I just had  x .s instead of the spud gun and you will be using the .s to close out kills much more often.So PA TLDR More strictly BnZ.  mm gun should be used sparingly only when certain. Dont get bogged down in turn fights you dont have the acceleration to get out if the situation turns sour.Overall Im a big fan of these aircraft but I prefer the PA because of the wider variety of options you have because of the increased power and the much greater ammo load even if it faces more difficult aircraft to fight. Good choice for anyone grinding the Soviet tree especially if you can get your hands on the A.,Warthunder,csqgn7p,26,t5_2uc6j

You can penetrate unangled Tigers from from in close range with regular ammo. Farther away you have to surgically remove all the crewmembers with APCR. Against Panthers you have to through the flat part of the mantlet pretty much no matter what ammunition.The playstyle is either to use its mobility and flank OR sit back and snipe.

They play similar. Instead of Ts and Ms youre going to be fighting Ts and early shermans.My advice other than what the others have mentioned here is protect your weakspots. I would suggest having a slight height advantage or a little bit of cover at your firing positions to protect your weak lower glacis. The other weakspot is the drivers viewport. Any piece of armour angled at  degrees is a weakspot and yours is particularly deadly. A well placed shot can knock out most of your crew. I suggest not firing from the same position more than twice and if you are getting return fire attempt to angle your drivers hatch a bit to increase your survival.The Stug is fun but they are on the road to bigger and better things so you have a lot to look forward to.,Warthunder,ct36txt,1,t5_2uc6j

Down to the last enemy or two left and then their team suddenly repopulates while no allies are added to your team.It seems like its goal is to keep the living players  to  which I can understand. If you were the one who joined and it added you in one at a time or added as many enemy aircraft as allies youd have a situation where youre taking off into a  to  disadvantage or worse and that would be even more frustrating.What I dont like is doing all the work to bring a match to a close only to have it underdone by JiP.

4594678,0,t1_ct9pthy,gt Its one of the hardest matchups for a  cant really comment on yaks since I dont fly them much. They turn better than you you should have a slight advantage in the vertical I am assuming  K?. Are your planes spaded? If not  roll onto your back and die not much else you can do DYes I got all s spaded. In K tried going vertical vs them but they could easily keep up both Merlins and Griffonsunless I do it wrong somehow. Versus Griffons rolling scissors only worked but it is rather delay once help is coming since it puts me in stalemate and once I end doing them he will shoot me down. The only real advantage is performance above  km where K is faster. G got edge in stall fighting and any slow speed maneuvering over Griffons but the Merlins easily can keep up unless I have energy and altitude advantage which is hard to achieve vs LF MK IX and USA MK IX. G feels worst in most cases Im dead with Spitfire around.gt It really depends what T props you mean since they play very differently. The Ki  for example is a very good jack of all trades fighter. It can turn and it can fight in the vertical. Yaks are the same kind of jack of all trades fighters so I dont really know which plane is stronger. Like I said I have pretty little experience in Russian planes I am sorry I cant help you a lot with them. JWs on the other hand are pure boom n zoom machines. Try to get them to maneuver turn anything that forces them to lose energy. When they do that they are as good as dead.JW isnt much problem its easy to avoid them but the Raidens Ki and NKwhich is now UFO since it doesnt stall. Raidens are fast with great roll rate CR and agility even on La its hard to avoid them and my main chance is getting some hits after he attack me. Ki feels like better Yak once they are above me which isnt rare I really have to do a lot to not die. I cant really outclimb them since my engine perform well up to  km.gt This kind of comes with experience. Sometimes it can be helpful to cut the throttle when initiating a turn because it lowers your turn radius sometimes it is not helpful because you need all the energy you can get. I often cut the throttle when I am on top of a loop  vertical maneuver before I roll over. Lowering throttle CAN also be helpful when beeing on the defensice scissors for example. NOTE dont lose too much speed doing that. It is no advantage when you get the enemy to overshoot but you have no energy left to take advantage of that situation.Yeah I also cut throttle at top lop but anyway thanks thats the reply I wanted.gt Keyboard when you want to turn as tight as possible mouse for aiming and fine maneuvering. Deeper explenation Keyboard deflects IO. Meaning that it either does  deflection or none. Because of that you lose as much energy as possible when turning. With the mouse you can decide yourself how tight you want to turn and how much energy you want better have to lose. Keyboard is great to maneuver when looking at your enemy since obviously you cant use the mouse in that situation.Sometimes I feel like when using keyboard my maneuvers are wider especially at higher speeds when high Gs kick in.gt Like most of the other stuff it really depends on the situation and comes with experience. It also really depends on the angle your enemy is coming and how fast he is. For example when there is an enemy diving at me from the front I will often do a split S when he is about . km away. When he is coming from behind I often start a wide turn when he is .. km away and turn tighter the closer he gets before he starts firing usually .. km. Because he is much faster he will have difficulties matching your turn and he will lose much more energy if he is stupid and tries to follow you tunnelvision ftw.That makes sense seems like I started to initiate too late mainly from .. km and that made me easy target.gt Convergance range affects nose mounted guns a little bit but not so much to be bothered with. Vertical targeting on the other hand affects wing mounted and nose mounted guns in the same way. If your distance is set to e.g. m and you have VT enabled than your rounds are fired at such an angle that they will hit your crosshair at m. This means that because of the bullet drop the rounds are fired upwards and drop so they meet your crosshair at m. So if you are aiming directly at an enemy that is m away and your convergance with VT on is set to m it can happen that your bullets go over the enemy even though you are aiming directly at him. Because of that I dont use VT except for a few special occasions. These are When you have guns with very different velocities like mm mg and mm mk. Without VT the mm and the mm rounds would never meet in flight because the mm drops much faster because it is much slower. So unless you are firing at very close range you can either hit with your mm OR your mm which sucks. With VT enables you have at least one point your convergance range in which all your rounds hit at the same time.I rarely fire from both weapons always using only weapon. I know how it works but I find easier to hit enemy without VT. Seems like its personal experience.gtBecause I am bored at work I just made a little picture with paint to explain it  Yeah I seen it good job by the way.gtVertical targeting can also be helpful in turnfights because it gives you a little bit more deflection. However this is not often really helpful.I lead too much usually so turning off VT helped me.gtI hope I could help you a little bit Yeah you did  thanks.,Warthunder,ct9r1yt,3,t5_2uc6j

4634987,0,t3_3eeva8,Something Ill mention which I think hasnt been addressed yet is to pay attention to tracer colors.  If you see a fight happening in the distance watch what kind of tracers are firing and thatll tell you a lot about who is behind who.For example a German fighter is mostly going to be shooting WhiteGreen tracers.  Those are some of the most blatantlyobvious to distinguish.  USSRUSA typically have bright red tracers.  If you see a LOT of them firing its obviously an American fighter blasting .cal lasers.Brits I believe also have reddish tracers but given their AirTarget ammo is actually tracerless you wont see tracers from them often.  Its basically better stealth ammo for them.Japanese mm cannons and their .cals have a obvious orange color to their tracers so those are also very easy to identify similar to Germany.  Youll get use to this with time.  As for spotting the dots down low its never an easy task for anyone.  As others have said here practice will make perfect.  Adjusting your PostFX settings definitely helps matters too ContrastReinhardetc. as others will recommend.  But even with good settings its never easy spotting someone with good camo down low.  Sometimes you may simply have to dive down low take a quick look around then go back up again and try tracking him once youve located his position.

4685246,0,t1_ctl3lz3,The primary reasoning itially for the invention of KCA was to improved the resistance to spalling over KA plate which is an improvement over HA which is an improvement over CA which is an improvement over FC which is an improvement over RHA. Initially designed to improve resistance to spalling and especially strength from repeated hits in a naval gunfire exchange. With also a core focus on reducing spalling into compartments behind the given aour plate. This is achieved by making the rear of the armour have certain elastic properties with the front been strong and ridged. Sure if the round was big enough spalling would still occur but it would be CONSIDERABLY less then that of comparable RHA or FC armour.This armour in this thickness mind you did stand up very well to incoming fire from a naval point of view.,Warthunder,ctl4cqo,1,t5_2uc6j

4834268,0,t3_3h2ytf,My recommendation is to use it as a mobile sniper. The upgraded engine alone makes it a much better tank than the Tiger  H. In doing so you can get yourself to good positions much better than a Jagdtiger a Maus or a Tiger II H. However unlike say the Leopard you can actually use your armor from your sniper position to potentially protect you.  Ive used this tank quite a bit back when it had its old BR and I did fairly well with it.  As others have noted once you get a penetration it is usually a one hit kill anywhere.  And what is better about this than the mm is that you have a much better reload.  I suggest you stick with some support and work angles on your opponents.  I used to pair up with some Panther IIs once again back when it was in a much worse situation for matchmaking and wed work flanks together quite effectively.,Warthunder,cu3wcr6,4,t5_2uc6j

However you generally want your code to be as simple as possible as long as it retains its flexibility. So for something like this it would make a lot more sense to only use the base numbers to balance vehicles with other vehicles and not changing the calculations. With that in mind youd want to ensure that you can use the base numbers as a proper metric as adding additional complication into the calculation just makes it that much harder to balance other vehicles in response to it and also can lead to wildly unpredictable results when changing base values.,Warthunder,cuax4h6,2,t5_2uc6j

I  wish they would just put a bunch of different scenarios together since they change them every day.  Even if you dont have a certain tank to play with that day say a Tier V you can always cycle in a new set the next day.Id like them to experiment with tight groupings of BR.

4960090,0,t3_3iuisc,First off the WT devs are incompetent.  Prop Pitch isnt actually a control on Propeller Pitch.  Its a Propeller RPM control.  But those dumbasses likely dont know any better.  When you adjust Prop Pitch you are actually adjusting what speed you want the Propeller to spin at measured in Rotations per Minute.  So you set the RPMs look in the cockpit at a specific value.  Then you set your engine power throttle via the manifold pressure gauge.  Now heres the catch  The propeller automatically adjusts the propeller pitch on its own to match the power output of the Rotations vs. Manifold Pressure.  For example if you keep the RPM constant and you set the Manifold high the angle of the propeller will be large.  I.E. A high angle to grip more air.  With the RPM at the same speed and you set the Manifold low the angle of the propeller will be small.,Warthunder,cujrboa,-4,t5_2uc6j

Also would be a good idea not to run off blindly into the middle of the map and get killed. Hold back and try to defend a valuable location Varies a bit on game mode. I would also suggest you try SB sometime yes it sucks that they only allow certain tanks in at once but if you are using a tank with a good long ranged gun then SB will usually be better as the maps are sometimes larger.

Unless it was a Panzer III IV or StuG your chances of penning it at long range were minimal. Anything Jagdpanzer IV or better had good enough armour to bounce Shermans with impunity at long range while their guns could penetrate the Shermans frontal armour at respectable ranges.At least with a T you would have a gun capable of firing back against most German AFVS.Of course even a  or Firefly is going to be mostly useless versus the real nasty stuff like Henschel King Tigers Ferdinands Jadgtigers and so on.,Warthunder,cuz37oo,1,t5_2uc6j

I dont really see why people would need to spend a bunch of time gaining RP to buy the Ferdinand and only have to do it again for the Elephant. And if they were grouped up no one would really research the Elephant. Theyd play the Ferdinand use that to grind the Jadgtiger. I dont think a simple machine gun port is really worth a complete tank. Its basically a modification for a frontal machine gun. And I dont think an entire new vehicle is really worth it. But knowing Gaijin theyll make it a completely new vehicle.

5202260,0,t1_cvczu3x,Youre missing the point entirely. What Im saying is that adding micropay and ingame economy to games will always be a detriment to fun gameplay. Being forced to grind the same modules over and over again for countless planes one at a time is not fun and does not serve any useful purpose other than trying to get people to pay to advance quicker. Yes its a free game but it takes a tremendous investment in time much more so than last year even with premium vehiclesaccount to have full access to all its vehicles without paying. Unless your idea of fun is getting stomped in unspaded planes. I referenced the past because before you could pay once for full access to a game and focus on the core gameplay which is simply flying airplanes and shooting other airplanes. Everything that Gaijin has done beyond that have primarily been low effort revenue based decisions and not particularly done in the interests of improving fun gameplay for its players. The pricing has also become astronomical and desire for players to support this game financially laughable when they use that money to mainly dev more moneymaking schemes and not improve gameplay.Want an example from the past? RBD was made  years ago and it was a well developed game with a good sized list of popular WWI planes that performed as you would expect from history and we played massive multiplayer matches in a sandbox. It was all about flying and shooting airplanes and the rest was up to us to create squads and competitions. It was also easier to get to know and group up with other players as opposed to being randomly thrown together in small matches which WT must do in order to generate usable stats and control the ingame economy. Want a squad in WT? Pay for it. But no more than  at a time in a match! Want to participate in an event? Pay for match entry on a poorly balanced mission with low value prize returns. Want some good planes to compete with? Do a long hard frustrating grind for them where it feels more like a parttime job than playing a game.Also the FMs in RBD were faithfully made. People know the Dr. was a good turnfighter and thats how it played in the game compared to other planes. The Spad XIII was a fast plane but slow turner and thats how it performed in the game. WT on the other hand is constantly breaking and changing FMs and many planes dont behave anything like they were reported to in real life. I dont know if you visit their forums but there are players who put a lot of time and effort into reporting these glaring issues and they still dont get fixed despite providing overwhelming evidence. When they do change planes its often an illogical nerf or BR change instead of addressing the real issue. This is especially frustrating for players who invest in premium vehicles to later watch them get broken and nerfd where they essentially threw their money into something that can no longer compete. In past games the devs did their homework and thorough testing and made some common sense balance decisions based on gameplay before release where WT just lazily throws vehicles into the wild with the focus of adding more content to their store. Id gladly pay for well thought out and pretested vehicle and mission packs though. Ive done that with Rise of Flight and also donated to the ATAG community to help support continued improvements to their Team Fusion Patches of IL Cliffs of Dover... which is where Ill probably be investing more of my flight time considering how bad WT is screwing things up. Finally telling people to just stop playing it if they dont like it is a poor argument. This game has well known problems and all Ive done is put them together in a list to state what I think theyre doing poorly as a business that wants to make money. Its also not hard to understand how people hang on after their investment in time money and interest in this games potential. Why do players complain about them? Because we want the game to be better and nothing will change if we dont voice our opinions. It also serves as a warning to newer players who simply have no idea how complex and jaded WTs system is so it saves them some heartache in discovering it the hard way on their own. So once again I stand by everything Ive stated and Ill decide what to do with that info on my own.,Warthunder,cvd2d8o,1,t5_2uc6j

Other planes dont turn well and are better suited to diving and hitamprun type attacks.  d dont expect to kill quickly if your plane only has a couple of .mm gunse get in closer.  .mm guns do little beyond m or so.  . cal  .mm do little beyond m or so.  mm and larger work well further away.f set convergence range and try to fire close to that range.  You want all your bullets to hit the same spot of the enemy plane.  If your guns are in the wings they are angled inward so that the bullets paths cross at some distance in front of your plane.  Thats your convergence range.  If you fire at or near that range you hit the same spot.  Further or closer away and theyll hit different spots spreading around the damage you are causing.  This isnt so much of an issue for nose mounted guns.g invest crew points for pilot vitality  try to get up to  points for all your pilots for now  this helps the pilot absorb a little damage without you getting killed because of pilot knockout.  Youll need more later as you progress and start encountering enemies with more and larger guns.  Try first to not get shot at all of course but second keep your pilot protected so if you do get shot you dont die from a pilot knockout which always feels like you got killed cheaply.  Armor plate on the back of the pilots seat an armored windscreen a heavy metal engine etc. can all help deflect bullets from the pilot.  Even the planes metal skin and internal structure can.  But the fuselage and the nose on twin engine planes are often just a lot of empty space for bullets to pass through to hit the pilot use the XRay view to see your plane in the hanger.  And the canopy of the plane offers almost no protection so dont expose the top of the plane to the enemy if you can avoid it.    Common mistake that exposes the top of your plane to the enemy is when the enemy is behind you banking sharply and then pulling a sharp turn  at that moment the enemy is facing the top of your plane.h climb at the start of the match even if you have to turn to the side or even fly away from the enemy at first to do it  get way above everyone rule of thumb  in tier   feet is usually enough after that    feet is more typically needed.  Gives you big advantages like  you can see people coming from far away because you are always looking around like I said to above right?  right? and do something about it early on.  Dont want to fight them?  Just fly away they have to slow down to climb up to you and you are fast in level flight.   while youre above people they may not even notice you at all and you can position yourself to make a diving attack on them  just as importantly by definition if you are above someone they cannot make a diving attack against you.  bombers tend to be up high by themselves and are easy to kill if you are already up high.  Theyre difficult to get to however if you are low and have to climb up to them.Two analogies further help explain why you want to be up high.Speed is life.  Altitude is life insurance because you can dive to trade altitude for speed.And speed is like cash altitude is like money in the bank.    When you dont need speed i.e. no enemies nearby climb to put money in the bank for later.h learn to fly with keyboard AND mouse together.  Mouse is good by itself especially for making fine adjustments when aiming at the enemy but keyboard lets you override it to make sharper maneuvers especially for rolling the plane without turning  its often useful to roll the plane before actually turning for instance.  Different countriesUS  heavy planes and fast in level flight dive fast usually dont turn or climb well and sometimes are undergunned.  By great Boom and Extend planes.  Great heavy fighters great bombers  their bombers usually have great turrets but not the biggest bomb loads.Germany  light planes and fast climb very well for the most part they tend to be very good at energy fighting which is something else to lookup with Google.  Top to bottom they probably have the best firepower.  Second best heavy fighters after the US IMHO.  Bombers are overall good too some carry large bomb loads but turrets are not as good as the uS.USSR  Jacks of all Traits masters of none.  Tend to do a lot of things well but little exceptionally well.  Not a fan of their heavy fighters or their bombers.Britain  tend to turn better than anyone else except the Japanese.  Good heavy fighters bombers a bit uninspired but they are ok  tend to have poor turrets but pretty large bombloads.Japan  the best turning planes overall but also the most fragile  a lot of their planes catch fire easily and cannot absorb much damage.  Their heavy fighters are ok not great.  Bombers also ok not great  their turrets are a mixed bag but smallish bomb loads.,Warthunder,cvhc1j5,3,t5_2uc6j

5517554,0,t1_cwgd6ov,Complicated questions have complicated answers. You cant make a sweeping statement generalizing ALL tanks because some German tanks are way better than their russian equivalent. Like the Tiger H.But here goesGerman tanks where specifically designed for long range combat. They have thin armor that needs to be angled long guns and ammo racks that speed reload time but are easy to hit.Russian tanks have sloped armor and better rounds than the Germans. Their guns dont have as much pen but at close ranges it doesnt matter.And thats the reason.  of the maps are close range maps. German tanks should only rarely fight below  meters. At those ranges the Germans have massive advantages easy to aim better pen faster reload. But the game doesnt let you fight at those ranges often. You have to cap points and fight on tiny maps where aim doesnt matter where Russian guns have no trouble penning.tldr The game is purposefully or inadvertently designed in such a way that it forces close range combat that favors the Russians. If we fought on large maps it would be the other way around. Case in point ask any Russian player how much they hate Kursk or any German how much they love it.,Warthunder,cwgx1fv,3,t5_2uc6j

5561545,0,t3_3r6m1a,SB I found an immediate improvement in flight characteristics from the E to the F. As the E IMHO tends to wobble and drift in a straight line but turns well. But one disadvantage was the new cockpit layout of the F was more harder to see out of...That being said I was pretty excited with the F as I was starting to get more hitskills then with the previous model...Unfortunately then I bought the F.The F for a lack of a better term is Unique From its Scaly looking camo to its choice in armament.  The F feels IMHO the most maneuverable and agile of the BFs but its lack of Pew pew is a serious drawback. The mm though fast and very accurate doesnt seem to have enough stopping power compared to mm. I found myself getting tons of hits but really struggling to down a aircraft especially if its a larger one like a bomber to the point I found the F very disappointing to use in any game mode...After the F I was just about to write off the BF  line...Then the F finally came around. This plane has it all...Its fast agile and plenty of Pew pew on tap. One of the best features is the gun pods though in SB I found them to be a hindrance due to the plane already has plenty of firepower and the weight of the pods seem to slow down your turn time etc just as having any attached bomb would do...But one major plus is they will rip a bomber to shreds with the right convergence. IMHO much faster then a Fw will. I just wish there was an option to drop them if they are empty. Now that Im on my GG...I actually find myself yearning for the F lol... Especially since the G feels a bit more sluggish and more suited for ground assault then a fighter role. ,Warthunder,cwmgl19,3,t5_2uc6j

5659085,1,t3_3si6mw,The late Bf s are some of the clearest cases of FM designer favoritism IMO.  I dont know of a single other series of planes thats always been performing either at or more often above their historical specs. Theyre always at their peak boost and anytime they get hit with a meaningful nerf theyre right back up next patch.Case in point as of . all of these planes now have significantly less control stiffening. Why nobody knows because they were close to right but a little bit lenient last patch. But no that wasnt good enough for fighting Spitfires running at  boost setting so they need to compress less now.Theyve consistently been able to turn bafflingly well too pop quiz which has a lower wing loading Tempest or Bf G? The answer is the Tempest and the other versions just get heavier so why they can turn better than the Tempest and even compete with Spitfires is crazy.They should have their advantages on the edge of stall against Tempests and in speed against Spitfires so why they need more unhistorical buffs is beyond me. If they cant fight their opponents well lower their BR thats what its for dont buff their FMs because of it.rant,Warthunder,cwykboh,1,t5_2uc6j

5681796,0,t3_3swc8p,Im not really a huge fan of the RB spawn system either.I dont think it makes sense to cripple the team that has a bad start. It creates a lot of boring games whether you win or lose. In TF a defending team spawns faster as they get closer to their last point while the attacking team spawns slower and has to travel a little bit.I also like being able to fly whenever I want. The spawn bombing problem can be solved by not having the airfields hilariously close to the GF map. They can have a separate SB tanks only mode for people that dont want to get bombed Ive never had problems being bombed constantly but I think combined arms should be viewed as an air and ground experience equally not a tank game where you can occasionally fly as a bonus sometimes.,Warthunder,cx1dsc8,8,t5_2uc6j

Once you get the option to do so I suggest you start playing the other nations and try tanks as well.  At least try to get tier  done with all nations before you decide if you want to specialize in one nation and mode or play them all. I personally play them all equally.Also play the tutorials and if you find regular matches too hard at first you can practice on the single missions  the AI planes are good for target practice.,Warthunder,cx1n0ta,1,t5_2uc6j

I feel a lot of the players just reach for the crutch of Russian bias rather than evaluating their own play style and attempt to improve it. A good German or any nation tank player doesnt bum rush the cap and sit duking it out with opposition tanks in the open. He advances in cover identifies a target moves from cover takes the shot and moves back to cover the player will rinse and repeat till it is safe to advance to the cap or he will maintain a firing position near the cap till sufficient opposition have been knock out and it is safe to cap. The objective is to keep your tank operational and knock opposition tanks out the cap counter takes time to count down. ,Warthunder,cx8gp8x,6,t5_2uc6j

5801072,0,t3_3un458,If you played the M and MA a lot you have the basic concept of this tank. Just think lower profile and slightly slower acceleration. Similar to those tanks once you get hit you are usually out or will be after the enemy reloads. The bonus of the T is the engine and transmission in the front which can sometimes be a bullet sponge. Another plus over those two tanks is the profile. You can hide in bomb craters and barely be noticed. Another thing I see when I face them is head glitching. They can see me over a ridge before I can see them making it look like Im getting shot through a hill. Stock the rounds are pretty bad equal to the APCR the MA gets after its stock potato. You can do some damage with them but rush to sabot rounds as fast as you can. The HEATFS shells have worse penetration than the sabot but have a bigger explosive hit and like all heat keep the penetration values at all ranges. Modules Get Parts and FPE A.S.A.P as the bullet sponge engine tends to light on fire. After those two focus on getting the sabot round.

6125163,0,t3_3zercx,Those dual Ms were never meant to be good at killing infantry. The M was designed when heavy tanks were seen as breakthrough tanks meant to smash through defended areas. Those Ms were for suppressing the area in front of the tank not really for killing anyone in particular.What might surprise you is that the M could have two Ms mounted right on the front of the hull for the driver to shoot for the very same purpose. Having fixed hull guns is bad enough but sort of understandable for the time but why they had a dedicated gunner for the twin Ms when they already had  Ms for the driver is beyond me.Speaking of how many Ms were in the hull its usually described as only having one but there are two mounting points and I have seen pictures with both being open and having guns in them. You can see the mounts on the M in the game on either side of the transmission plate with the right one being open and the left closed. Not sure why the Ms are functional and the drivers gun isnt.In conclusion those twin Ms were just a small contribution to the failure of the M.,Warthunder,cylv8d7,1,t5_2uc6j

You have to learn your planes what they are good at what they are bad at the opponents planes and how to exploit weakness. So for that I usually turn to Youtube for reviews of planes Magtv is a pretty good source for honest opinions of planes and excellent advice on how to fly them. You also need to learn flying style Turn and Burn Boom and Zoom Energy Fighting or Jack of all trades. You should find out what you are most comfortable with and find planes that suit that style and then move onto other styles when you feel confident enough. I personally am a terrible Turn and Burner SpitfiresZerosKi average energy fighter Bfs average Jack of all trades Yaks Aircorbas and a good Boom and Zoomer Fw Cousairs It takes time and checking youtube a lot to figure out how to counter planes that you meet and turn most encounters to your advantage. ,Warthunder,cymn0mc,1,t5_2uc6j

The Lees are tricky to do well in given their gun platform but with practice can be decent. And the Locust is fun but is plagued with a steering and gearbox glitches. Some do great in the TD at . but it doesnt fit my style.So assuming youre stuck in your grind below . use a combination of Stuarts AA and fightersbombers in your lineup. Since Stuarts are fast focus on capping as this gives you a good amount of RP. Then coming is as Air Support later on in the match granted this may be minutes later should help your team toward a victory.. is another bit of a dead spot but the MA is one of my personal favorites. Getting good in this should help you unlock the .s which while not easymode given youll face hordes of Ts are much more capable. Now with that said the next fun youll have probably wont be until the M at .. But this gives way to .. which is...just truckloads of fun think Bulldog.

However it has a low firepower so bombing hunting is difficult.The Bf  is overall a very good climber from tier II to tier IV but it often requires the engine injection to really shine at that. Fw  might be a more effective bomber killer  it has a lower climb rate but a much higher fire power. Well both fighters have a good fire power so bomber killing is their thing.The Spitfire is also a very good climber with some tier III  IV spitfires being really impressive. Some of them remind me of a Soyuz space rocket. At tier IV Im impressed by the British Tempest and the Japanese JW.Am forgetting a couple of planes. The USSR has no really good climber but their fighters are not bad at climbing either.

6332841,0,t1_cz9gx23,Well I think the reason they dont call for changes in the tiger and panther are because they have good counters ingame already. With the tiger any mm gun can kill it from the front within  meters and for the panther you just shoot the turret or flank it to kill it. But as far as overperformance goes yeah those tanks are tough but theyre not invincible. The problem a lot of people complain about is how even when they are point blank with Ts they cant reliably penetrate them thanks to the bounce mechanics and thus become the instant target of calls for nerfing. It also really doesnt help that the vast majority of this sub are heavy german tank users.

6335728,0,t3_42ex1s,Firstly you both start at the same spawn height so if the other players are getting above your spawn its because your team allowed it to happen.  Hence you should climb at the start of the battle amp win the fight for altitude supremacy then there wont be a problem.If that fails and theres enemies over your spawn dont try to helicopter straight up at them as they have all the advantages and youre only presenting your plane as an easy kill.  You have two options. Dive from spawn focus on low altitude combat and ignore the higher planes.  Its highly unlikely that theyll be a problem as they wont want to dive from ft to engage someone below spawn altitude.. After spawning fly out to the side of the battle away from those fighters and climb when its safe to do so.  Then turn back and engage them when youre on the same altitude or better still are even higher than the enemy planes.

Theres a book on solid propellant but I cant remember the name at the moment that talks about the combustiblity of solid propellant but doesnt talk about penetration by tank shells since its not a military specific book. Im not sure if WW Ballistics Armor and Gunnery has details but Id figure it would. Youre biggest tank specific details will come from detailed reports that youll have to scour through the Internet to find.,Warthunder,czc0mjx,1,t5_2uc6j

6359406,0,t1_czchjdu,We have completed our work on the basic physics that relate to the thermodynamics of aircraft engines. Through the use of these physics heat emission and the time limit before mechanical failure of the powerplant become far more detailed while engine management becomes more flexible and adaptable to the conditions it is under weather conditions atmospheric conditions operating conditions and others.In Arcade battles the current situation with thermodynamics will not change. But for those who prefer Realistic and of course Simulator modes information about the new thermodynamics will be extremely useful. So whats new?The main differences in the current physics implementation are as follows. Engine heat emissionIn the new thermodynamics model heat emission is more dependent on the engine settings  the current engine power supercharger setting RPM and other factors.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!The current implementation did not take most of these factors into account so temperatures were not very affected by engine settings for example with the fall in manifold pressure and power upon ascent over critical altitude the temperatures continued to rise. The new heat emission model will now take all these factors into account so that during flights higher than the critical altitude for the engine the equilibrium temperatures are reduced which allows for longer flight duration at higher altitudes than at lower ones.. TemperatureEquilibrium temperature is now determined by the balance between the radiated heat the heat is radiated by radiators the engine itself and the cowl etc. and the heat generated by an operating engine.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!Depending on the position of the oil or air radiators the radiator flaps the amount of heat radiated will change.The effectiveness of the radiators has also been modelled more realistically  the main working area of the radiator flaps is set between  to  opening so that any further opening of the radiator flaps only results in an insignificant Equilibrium Temperature reduction but still provides a few more minutes of safe engine operation. It is generally enough to open the radiator flaps to  as this will not cause a significant decrease in flight characteristics but will allow the engine to be used with a normal temperature setting.The effectiveness of heat radiation depends on the weather conditions during the mission. Heat transfer with the environment is more obviously more effective in cold weather so the radiator needs only to be opened very slightly. However in a hot climate the reverse is true so the the radiator flaps should be opened wider than normal.The speed of temperature change now depends on the difference between the current temperature and the Equilibrium Temperature under current engine settings the greater the difference between temperatures the more intensive the heat transfer is and the higher the speed that the temperature changes. This is an advantage in aircraft engines  due to the difference in temperatures being higher when the engine settings are changed the heat transfer is more intensive so that temperatures change faster and these engines cool down and warm up quicker.. Preliminary warmupPreliminary engine warmup when starting to play has been introduced to prevent having to wait for the engine to reach a safe takeoff temperature the aircraft appears on the runway with engines that are already warmed up.. Time limitsThe time limit for safe engine operation now depends on the current temperature setting.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!What this means is that the temperature readings and indicators in every engine setting need to be monitored and the acceptable operational time should not be exceeded. The maximum setting may be used for fifteen to thirty minutes in the majority of aircraft while the War Emergency Power setting can be used for  to  minutes or less. If temperature limitations are not adhered to and the engine is significantly overheated the operational time is reduced to a minimum going down to as little as under  seconds.Time is also limited at other settings  the lower the power and heat emission of the engine the longer the engine can be used under that setting. It is also possible to achieve longer operational times by setting up the engine in accordance with current conditions by doing things such as fully opening the radiator flaps it is possible to get another few minutes of operation under the War Emergency Power setting. The more the Equilibrium Temperatures are lowered the more safe engine operation time can be achieved.Because of this it is possible for the engine to operate safely in cold weather for a very long time even if the radiator flaps are only slightly open where in hot climates the flaps should be opened wider Under normal temperatures it is possible to exchange drag created by fully opened radiator flaps for a longer time of operation. New display systemThe new display system has changed the logic of the way that information about the current state of the engine is displayed.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!Because the operational time of the engine is now affected by heat balance and the current temperature it was decided that the timer should no longer be used.Now the remaining time of operation is shown by the colour of the temperature indicator white indicates that the engine is operating normally yellow signifies  to  minutes orange  to  minutes red  less than  minutes and flashing red is a warning that there is less than  minute remaining.. Recovery after an extended operating timeAfter the engine has been operating for an extended period it requires time to fully restore the time limit.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!This means that the engine needs to be cooled and lower power settings should be used for a short while so that the engine can rest. Generally approximately half of the time limit of the required setting is needed for full engine recovery for example when WEP is used under automatic engine control for  minutes it means that after this limit is reached the aircraft should fly at  for around . minutes to recover all  minutes of the WEP limit.. Automatic radiator managementAutomatic radiator management now monitors the engine setting and automatically selects a radiator flap position that ensures the optimal combination of cooling and minimal effect on flight characteristics.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!The automatic management is connected to engine control devices  when the pilot sets the engine setting by lowering or increasing the throttle they also set the desired temperature which is maintained by the automatic radiator management thermostats.In this way the optimum flap position is maintained during level flight with constant power settings and speed. When the setting is changed to a more powerful one the radiator flaps are fully closed while heating up to the new automatically set temperature which serves to both speed up warmup time and decreases the drag of the plane allowing for more snap acceleration. On the other hand when the engine setting is changed to a less powerful one the radiator flaps will open fully until the engine cools to a new Equilibrium Temperature.. Engine damage from overheatingWhen the time limits are exceeded the engine begins to lose power operation becomes unstable revolutions fluctuate and other issues can occur.Click here to read more about this particular technical topic!However even a damaged engine can be saved if you react in time and change the setting to one that is less demanding such as setting the engine for minimum revolutions  throttle and fully open radiators to cool the engine to a suitably low temperature so that the temperature indicator shows that the minimum time limit has been restored where it stops blinking. These actions will prevent further damage to the engine and maintain partial engine performance which is enough to return to the airfield and even to be able to participate in aerial combat.The possibility of saving the engine and its remaining power as well as the speed at which the engine accumulates damage depends on the degree of overheating. For instance if the engine is heated to the boiling point of the coolant liquid it will guarantee that the liquid form continues to be lost and a vapour will be formed leading to the inevitable death of the engine after the effective coolant liquid runs out. However damage that occurs as a result of exceeding time limits at a setting which uses a normal temperature will happen slowly and will provide enough time to cool and preserve the engine. The higher the temperatures at which the time limit is exceeded the faster the engine will become damaged and lose power.,Warthunder,czchs1z,24,t5_2uc6j

6384236,0,t1_czf08b6,gtBut i would simply get out my tank in RB and get another one instead of driving from the front and doing minutes of nothing.This is the decision air RB players face when their plane gets damaged specifically the oilwater lines. Do you stay in the fightkeep your altitude and try to continue contributing on a compromised airframe or do you limp back to base to try to get a fresh aircraft at the cost of your battle participation and any altitudeenergy advantage you might still have?And honestly thats a pretty valid challenge to put a player in. They have to analyze their situation and make a choice. So long as the tank can still move and fire it can kill something just like a damaged plane. Its just more difficult.

In both of them you control a tank and try to shoot oponents to either kill them damage modules of the tank or kill crew members. In both of them you win by either killing all the vehicles in the other team or by capturing strategical positions around the map. In both of them you unlock vehicles in a Research tree based on different nations aquiring exp points by playing matches. Heck even in both of them you can buy a Premium Account that increases your income OR buy special premium tanks that give more currency... I would say they are really fucking similar.

6600506,0,t3_45smt1,Quite evidently Gaijin has fiddled around with how AEC works and has come up with a satisfying and rather complex compared to the old one implementation which works quite satisfactory.   New AEC handles those several conditions.   Military Power  Keep radiators open until water temperature is below yellow. Then continues to keep it below that threshold with minimum possible radiator aperture. WEP When water temperature is below orange it will close the radiators to allow higher speeds. When water temperature is orange it will open radiators to around . When water temperature is red the radiators will fully open. Power off Radiators will fully close. That for example didnt happen with the old system which kinda gimped glide time when using AEC. All in all AEC is now doing quite a good job at maintaining engine temperatures and plane performance.

6602368,0,t1_d01yk75,What benefit would photographs serve?  Its a more complicated mechanic it would require a new GUI requires that the game render lots of scenes unless its actually saving the photographs.. and its not historically accurate.  Instead a system based on radio transmission would both fit well with the current game systems and be more realistic.  Recon planes could just have a reloading action like AB bombs or RB artillery that begins the transmission of enemy vehicles spotted through the bombsight or gunsight.While were at it why not add it to all vehicles?  Recon planes get a wider FoV longer range and faster transmission times fighters have a very narrow FoV target has to be within a few degrees of the gunsight and very long transmission times tanks have relatively quick transmission times while the radioman is alive but require the enemy is ranged by the gunner first and so on?  It might actually make radiomen and the radio module itself useful when not arty spamming and adds a strong buff to having otherwise worthless planes in the air. ,Warthunder,d028mhd,7,t5_2uc6j

6621168,0,t3_469myk,You didnt mention which nations you like and how far you have to grind out their trees but Ive always been a fan of talismans. Theyre cheaper than premiums and you can put them on proven killers which will earn you more RP instead of rolling the dice on an unproven premium. Talismans also never expire like premium account time does. Spread them around on some key planes and you can unlock a tree through Tier IV very quickly. This also gives you some variety instead of grinding the same premium all the time and decreases your chances of getting stuck with a premium that Gaijin nerfs or breaks after you buy it. Theres some good premiums that come at a fair price too but avoid the ones that are just copypasta FMs of their regular versions like the P Griffon Spits and so on. For instance just talisman an Fw  D instead of buying a D. The main advantage of premiums over talismans is that they earn you SL in addition to a tad more RP depending on the plane. Ive also thrown spare change on acing and maxing crew skills but only tend to do that when theres sales. Outside of that dont waste GEs on anything that doesnt earn you RP like decals prize boxes contest entries skins you can earn modules you can grind or any of the other pay traps.,Warthunder,d046pd3,1,t5_2uc6j

6838535,0,t3_49fmjx,BFM and ACM are still important in close engagements using boresight weapons but the transition to beyond visual range BVR and high offboresight HOBS weapons means theres some question as to the utility of BFM in modern air combat.BVR weapons are things like the AIM R and R missiles intended for uses at ranges beyond km.HOBS weapons such as the AIMX and RM allow for shots at  degrees off the nose or more making maneuvering in close even more important however the next generation of HOBS weapons are purported to include missiles with  degree OBS capability i.e. firing upon targets directly behind the launch platform. which would make maneuvering a moot point.When it comes to missile engagements the three critical factors are altitude airspeed and angle. Contrary to popular belief missile motors do not burn the entire way to the target. Rather there is a brief highthrust burn then a sustainer motor burns at a lower thrust but longer duration and then the missile glides the rest of the way to the target on momentum.Because of this being above your target affords increased range and speed to your missile as its all downhill to the target. Similarly being at a lower altitude than your target means that they can engage you from a longer range than you can engage them Assuming approximately equal missile performance.TAS for the launch platform is free speed for the missile thus a fast launch platform with a high closure rate will be able to launch a very fast missile that gets to the target quickly. Similarly a target that is at high speeds and running can reduce the missiles closure rate thus increasing its time of flight and reducing its energy.Angle plays a part in both detection by radar and missile evasion. A missile tracking a target moving at an angle to it must expend energy to turn furthermore missiles are still airframes and thus have a minimum turn radius and maximum sustainable Gforces. When evading a missile the intent is to force an overshoot much like in BFM and forcing an overshoot by a highspeed attacker. without letting the missile pass close enough to detonate and fill your plane with holes.,Warthunder,d0rg8yo,15,t5_2uc6j

6846423,0,t1_d0sbzzf,Silly me what was I thinking  I forgot that cockpits dont offer immediate economical gain so why spend precious artist and developer time on modeling and getting them to work right.Oh except for all the lost profits from people who would like to play SB but are so discouraged by the obvious neglect that they just decide to play some other games that have the cockpits and that includes all the players that maybe get fed up with AB get fed up with RB and try to move into SB only to realize that roughly one third to half of the planes in any given tech tree is given a substantial advantage no cockpits  perfect allround visibility if one is unscrupulous enough to use said advantage. Sure most of them are bombers that technically shouldnt be much of a threat to fighters but due to other unrelated fuckups and neglect of the SB side of the game they can be used in air combat as well.About the only thing keeping me involved with War Thunder is that it still has some unique features so far one of them being able to play in same missions with tankers supporting your team and destroying the enemy team on the ground which really isnt offered by many games at all. Theres ARMA and ARMA but those things are more infantry simulators with the vehicles more or less thrown in as a side dish trying to use the vehicles especially planes is a bit clunky.Oh and by the way? You know the Guinness Record about most planes in a flight simulator that War Thunder currently holds? Took the record from IL  if I recall right.Turns into a bit of a sham if you were to remove all the planes that dont have cockpits implemented yeah?Addendum Yeah yeah they did it right with the Do  and the Japanese heavy fighter but the point still stands  theyre adding cockpitless planes into the game when they arent even done adding cockpits to the existing planes. In fact I dont know of any cockpit that would have been added to the game if the plane didnt have the cockpit when it was introduced.Does anyone know if that has ever happened? Pe might be the only one that has received a cockpit after that their promises of adding cockpits to the bombers have been conspicuously absent from any dev updates.,Warthunder,d0sck5p,7,t5_2uc6j

The ho is also a flying fuel tank as long as your not hitting the fuselage or wing tips you are shooting its fuel tanks this is easily one of the most fragile jets in war thunder and it breaks it wings like no other jet at its tier. The ho also is terrible in the acceleration category and is capable of being run down by high tier props if it doesnt have good RPMs and is flying slow Hortens must side climb to get to optimal speed and altitude which gives the enemy plenty of time to climb and try to kill you midclimb.

6863514,0,t1_d0t8agq,As much as I love using the AA guns Ill agree that it does bother me that the guns are magically remotecontrolled from inside the tank. I definitely wouldnt want to be exposing my commander if Im under fire but then Id probably have my hands full with something else and not worrying too much about planes.Probably the best way to go about this would be to have a button to toggle the commander turned inout which will enabledisable the AA gun. Pressing the MG button with the commander turned in will only fire the coax if the tank has one. Of course Gaijins also not very good at animating humans so I dont know how horrible the commander climbing inout of the tank would look. Unless Gaijin went the easy route just put a timer on it and the commander would suddenly teleport outside the tank.You could also retroactively apply this to the M and have the commander take cover inside the turret to turn in.Although you also have a problem with the turret if its faced sideways or backwards obviously theres no engine deck to stand on. Limiting the turret traverse would just be annoying having the commander sit on the turret itself would look strange and no one wants to see a guy floating off the side of a tank holding onto the M.And technically using the binoculars should also require the commander to turn out but I think thats going too far personally. Its not worth risking a crew member just to use binoculars most of the time.,Warthunder,d0uafgw,2,t5_2uc6j

6882465,0,t3_49zv8q,AB Air I dont shoot planes that I outright pity OSU for example unless I have to. Depending on the BR and how confident I am sometimes Ill even follow Wellingtons and Stirlings and such around let them get a bomb load or two off then shoot them down before they cause too much damage.I also dont camp spawns. If I find myself over the enemy spawn I give them about  seconds to get out of spawn and look around before clearing myself to shoot at them. Generally this is about halfway between spawn and the center of the map if they go straight. Bombers get until theyre past the fighter spawn which is about the same amount of time.And Ill shoot down teamkillers on the enemy team before Ill shoot down anyone else if I have the opportunity. Flying a Corsair I once saw a Spitfire which I normally have no mercy for in AB due to being UFOs being shot at by a P on his team. Breaking off from the Spitfire I had been targeting I went after the P and even let the Spitfire know in all chat what I was doing. Of course the ungrateful bastard took the opportunity to shoot me down and was summarily teamkilled by the P. Idiot probably had all chat off. Never trust a Spitfire pilot.All other modes Im shooting anything and everything I can get my hands on. And sometimes the best way to get to the objective in RB GF is through the enemy spawn.

I only know some rudimentary stuff about aerodynamics and flight characteristics but the pilots testimonies of exceptional turn performance dont seem unfeasible. Having the second engine in the rear of the craft moves the center of mass closer to the tailmiddle of the craft where center of lift lies. Having the CoM closer to CoL decreases stability and increases maneuverability. If the wing of the aircraft is small or the wing loading of the craft is high the aircraft will be less maneuverable even if the CoM and CoL are close together. However the Do has large wings and control surfaces a CoM that is closer to the CoL and low wing loading.,Warthunder,d1glb3s,3,t5_2uc6j

7080543,0,t3_4ckcoa,A headon is something you avoid long before it happens. Generally accomplished by climbing to the side instead of straight towards the center of the map. From there if someone starts heading your direction you need to make note of it from at least two miles away or else theyre far too close for you to do anything about it. Ideally youd notice them heading for you at three miles or more and could engage or disengage at your discretion.However theres some situations where youll simply end up in a headon and you just have to deal with it. In this case it depends a lot on your plane. You mention flying Griffon Spits your guns are very accurate on their own but spread out along a wing they arent much good at long range. Evade once you see the enemy start firing then turn to engage them once you pass. Do not try to get guns on at the last second youll be making a much larger movement than they will and youre more than likely going to end up crashing into each other.As for evading its fairly simple. Elevator up rudder and aileron in the same direction left or right doesnt matter. I personally use X and C for my elevator downup respectively so an evasive roll for me would be pressing CDE or CAQ at the same time. A and D being the default roll and Q and E the default yaw of course.Again once youve passed the enemy and survived the headon its your choice to try to extend away or to turn and engage. But youve gone from a situation where you have no choice to a situation where you have a choice so your odds have already drastically improved.,Warthunder,d1iy0dk,1,t5_2uc6j

7140916,0,t3_4dcceu,The game mode is a long running battle with multiple respawns. Each spawn of a new plane one that you didnt manage to land or which you havent flown before in the battle youre in costs a certain amount of SL to spawn. In order to spawn in you need to have enough SL to do so you cant be short on cash. Your balance is shown in the top right and shows the number of SL youve made from kills and bombing minus the spawn costs. Any half decent pilot should be capable of running a positive balance.The object of the game is to defeat the enemy ground forces and bases.Theres also AI ground and air forces which can be engaged as mission goals. Of course there is plenty of fighter action too as someone has to make sure that the bomber doesnt get through or gets shot down depending on the perspective.The first side to reach k in victory points wins but theres also tickets which can be drained under certain circumstances. The victory points go up if youre in the vicinity of the enemy.Basically you need to collect a couple of planes in the given BR range. You have to have at least  plane thats at the minimum BR of a bracket. Id recommend putting in a fighter and a bomber as close to the minimum as possible. Then depending on your likings available slots and inventory expand this with intermediate and higher ranking aircraft.editCorrection Mixed up SL and GE  fixed now,Warthunder,d1pug60,1,t5_2uc6j
7142025,0,t1_d1pjtf5,gt Once the explosive filler is  grams its a OHK noquestion.Thats definitely not true in my experience. Especially after LMS Ive even had the Jagdtiger fail to oneshot opponents. Its rare sure but it does happen. And Id personally rather have a  chance to one shot and  chance to  shot with a short reload than a  chance to one shot with a horribly long one.gtPlus whats more infuriating than being KSed after doing  of the damage? Its not like War Thunder distribute points by damage done i.e. World of Warships.Thats not quite true either. The point system in air battles is definitely totally in favor of kills over damage but the GF system is a bit more balanced. You will generally get more points for doing  critically damaging shots without a kill than you do for stealing someones kill with a single shot that only kills the last one or two crewmen. This is easiest to check in RB mode by hitting tab and checking your spawn points after each shot.gtThe . deal with the D is actually not as bad if you know how to use HE not sure now with the latest patch.The latest patch has in fact pretty much ruined HE. The explosive radius has been shrunk to a fraction of its former size. A day after the patch hit I took out my M and tried to kill a TM with HE. I put  penetrating HE hits into its top turret and only killed  crewmen and no module damage. Similar stories for MausE in my IS.

US spread is just painful right now and you only get a win at that BR if you have a lucky or particularly skilled team. Id also say lower the Sherman Firefly to this same BR because its a Sherman thats getting outmatched regularly as well and has a very similar gun minus it lacks APHE.Jumbo with the  I feel works alright where it is but the  one is a little over tiered. At . it faces tanks that give zero shits about its armor and laugh at the mm cannon. Would be better suited at . or .. M needs to get downtiered. Its a M with a mm...... and its got a BR of .. Thats higher than the T which is better than it in every way essentially and is . below it though. Needs to be dropped to . or .. This thing would do well if it fought Panthers and Tiger Is but where its at right now just subjected it to the Tiger II spam. General point of tank destroyers for most nationsnis to give an excellent gun on a weak chassis thats easy to pen. High risk high reward. But at this BR its an OK gun on a horrible chassis that just dies. Exception to this is of course the Hellcat which has an OK gun and piss poor armor but makes up for it raw speed and agility.

7223763,0,t1_d1yt236,Well youre right I think its a little of Column A and a little of Column B! But While the Germans dont the Soviets sure do and boy are they popular too! So frankly with the teams generally being USSR  Ger vs USA  UK at least in my experience Id say its not as big an issue as it seems that the Germans dont have tanks in that BR and like you said they do ahve a few vehicles which im sure as time goes on will become more unpopular as they are as you said casemated TDs.While there are a few vehicles in the . range for the US and UK that are decent! But when I played through the US there it was hard to have a good lineup as using only the T you get the Jumbo  which has issues where its at and the MAEM Hellcat which isnt very good up there although the Hellcat is very effective on open maps still. Add the M and you see Ts which isnt worth it at all!I understand what you mean with the German gap being the issue and you have a fair point there! After the PzIV H at . they go right to .! But the Germans didnt have anything that can fit there in Tanks at least. The problem with the Allies can be fixed with better BRs That make sense too and Tiering issues while the German line solution requires more imaginative fixes as you cant add vehicles that werent designed!IMO part of the soultion would be to have uneven number of players on a team as a team of . tanks vs a team of . tanks can be more balanced if it is weighed in the . teams favor such as many events are with planes! not sure of any with tanks tbh,Warthunder,d1zadbl,1,t5_2uc6j

7330636,0,t3_4fpzh3,I might have missed a couple of details in your post which is by the way well detailed and researched gg but wouldnt the fix you suggest lead to an enormous balance problem?Basically there are a few things that significantly buff the Sabre variants  hydraulic controls and most importantly the AB lead indicator in RB. This would make aiming so much easier I already feel the balance problem. On the other hand most things you suggest would definitely nerf the Mig. Both are currently fighting on moreorless equal ground with some claiming that the Mig is actually struggling I havent tested myself. This list of change would mean that the US top tier jets would be significantly stronger than the USSRs. If USSR jets get stomped by US this would call for a new Soviet top tier jet and you already see the problem.Broadening the battle rating? Would be sure an excellent idea to improve balance but queue times are a thing and its not only a Gaijinimagined problem. Even here when there are some special events you get posts complaining about enormous queue time and in the current WW chronicle many people move to AB because they got tired of waiting for a RB match. Possible fix  get more people into jets. For example give players a nation RP boost that works only when researching your highest available tier. But this might have other implications on the game economy and finally on Gaijins financial situation.Again I may not have understood everything so please correct me if Im wrong.,Warthunder,d2bfz3y,9,t5_2uc6j

Its a VERY good plane and can turn the tide of battle. But youll see people complain about it because it isnt like the other american planes. It takes skill to fly and actual knowledge of what the plane can and cant do and its playstyle is almost unheard of in the lower tiers. Most planes up to that point are just basic BnZ planes. While the Germans have to learn the  from the very beginning and while not the same they have similar playstyles.

So you have to shoot the butts of the medium tanks and even then it takes almost  rounds to actually take it out. If you start using it go for the soft ground targets and upgrade STRAIGHT to the offensive mm. Once you get the HVAP rounds for the mm you can press the high caliber armament button once and the tank explodes from any angle you shoot it at! Its pure heaven.

7373270,0,t3_4gaseq,I posted this in a thread a while back here is a cut amp paste.You need to be able to record your chosen moments either the replay or the actual gameplay itself.I use Shadowplay because unlike Fraps or other capture software it does not impact your game framerate. It does this by constantly storing the last  minutes of gameplay on a chip on my GPU which I can tell it to save at any time. It only works on newish Nvidia GPUs so if you are using an AMD GPU or something older you will have to use Fraps Bandicam or some other capture software to record your footage.These programs will record your gameplay after you tell them to but cannot be used to capture gameplay after it happens like Shadowplay does.They also reduce your framerate since they are constantly saving raw video footage to your hard drive while you play. The raw video when uncompressed can fill your hard drive up pretty fast. And the FPS drop can be an issue while playing depending on your PC specs but generally doesnt matter if you are just recording your replays.Ill run down how I make GIFs in steps others may have a different or better way to do it.Step . After a good or interesting round Ill use Shadowplay to record the previous  minutes of gameplay. You could just use FRAPS to record your replayStep . Using free Microsoft Movie Maker I tell it to load up the recorded footage. I do this by dragging the video file into Movie Maker.Step . After a few minutes the file will be loaded and I can edit the footage. Using the Trim Tool I trim down the video to the  seconds I want to use in the GIF.Step . I then save the now much shorter video using the  for high definition display setting with an easy to identify name. For example the edited video file I turned into this GIF I named Me  vs MA. Saving it with this setting compresses the file a lot which makes it much smaller than the raw video file.  minutes of raw Shadowplay footage is GB  seconds of video compressed by Movie Maker is MB.Step . I then go to  and click upload. Then I drag the new compressed shortened video file into the window give it a title and tag it War Thunder and click create. After a few minutes the video will be uploaded to gfycat and converted into a GIF and you can copy the GIF link and share it on reddit or wherever you like. FYI gfycat has a maximum  second length for GIFS. I dunno if you can make them longer by paying.I hope this has been informative.

7380113,0,t3_4g7y90,Also the RNG gods rule. Against a T if you have the chance the turret is a more reliable kill shot or even better the turret ring. But the front plate of a T can bounce anything German or especially British amp US at something around  chance depending on the shell. Larger shells bounce a little less but it can bounce a short  at point blank less chance with a long  but it can happen.Best way to kill a T is to use  a Soviet tank as the RNG modifiers seem to be less effective against Soviet ammo. I base that on playing Ts one seems to very rarely bounce another Ts shot whereas solid shot is often bounced and German APHE while less likely to bounce does frequently do so likelihood varies by calibre as well as angle.,Warthunder,d2h2grc,1,t5_2uc6j

They can even get lucky crits with convergence set to  but penetration drops off at that distance so I compromise.  Personally I wouldnt mind m convergence or being able to set pairs of guns at different ranges but then its Gaijin.  Ce la vie.Also having experimented with the airacobra that has .s in the nose and .s in the wings with tracers to get an idea m convergence is the point where you start getting Contrastyle spreadshots.  I mean yeah technically you can set your guns to m convergence and have a chance at taking down three planes at once but if you dont have nose guns I find any convergence below about m makes the guns useless  At prime killing ranges your shots might graze the enemys wingtips and farther than that you will not be sniping any B engines today or hitting it at all past m.Speaking of shotgun patterns its kind of a shame nowadays anyway Im sure some  year old veterans are happy that no one came up with a useful reliable canister round for aircraft cannons of mm or larger.  I mean if AP cannon rounds are like slugs and HEI cannon rounds are like Dragonfire shells canister rounds would be like  buckshot which at close range could have presumably instantly turned a plane into an impressive amount of falling debris.Well off to build a time machine and head to the patent office!,Warthunder,d2uinrg,1,t5_2uc6j

Adding infantry just to adhoc a niche vehicle tree is not the best use of both time and resources. Imo i cant see the attraction of having such vehicles in WT. Its a self propelled crematorium and is by any and all means worse in Tank vs Tank engagements than its counterpart. Just looking at it from the game play perspective adds tons of unnecessary issues.

7577396,0,t3_4j3v5g,MrDeth is right about the soft cap I dont have damning evidence of its existence but the rewards definitely get smaller as you get more points. Getting  kills while flying a plane isnt much more than getting .Losing puts a huge dent in your final RP versus winning something like  reduction. I wish people realized this and incentivized winning over being an RP whore or doing selfish stuff that jeopardizes the game. I believe RP rewards also depend on how high your battle activity is. I understand the need for it but it really sucks when youre legitimately searching for the last guy whos hiding and hes diluting your activity.I believe all playerflown planes are worth the same number of points. You may get more cumulative points from a bomber by for example setting him on fire and letting him burn for a bunch of Hits and Critical Hits. Assists do earn you points. I think any action that gets you a notification message like hit critical hit assist or aircraft destroyed is going to give you RP.Certain plane types bombers and attackers I believe get more rewards for killing ground targets.,Warthunder,d33ii0c,3,t5_2uc6j

7665265,0,t1_d3dhexq,The cost of respawning in a heavy tank is extremely high for one and that wasnt even my point. In a pure one life scenario the T is supreme at .. Yes everyone here is unhappy about its terrible damage but thats still ignoring how strong the tank is anyways.In a full  v  on anything that isnt Rhine The Ts will be able to take a hulldown sniping position and Tiger IIs will try to snipe as they should as well. Then they both shoot at each other. The T has shit damage the Tiger II has good damage however the Tiger II cannot hurt the T at all. This means given time the T is astronomically more likely to damage the Tiger II. Now that LMS is gone you can repeatedly shoot at the turret until you kill his gunner and he dies. Even with bad damage you can still kill the gunner. Played properly the Tiger II is a sniper and the T will be a hulldown sniper.My golden rule as to why the American super heavies are good tanks versus other nations        In a fight you can hide your hull but you can never hide your turretTherefore a weak hull is a much better situation than having a weak turret. For your other comment this is my point. The T doesnt fight evenly  against Tiger IIs as other than damage it is a superior vessel it isnt an even fight a good T player is better than a good Tiger IINow if you added the APHE shell from the mm E or whatever it is called the T becomes even more lethal.Note This is how the T should also be played and why it is better than the Tiger II as wellA tip for you specifically feel free to just edit your post next time to add info! You dont need to make two separate posts. I want to point out as well that I play American Tanks as well and am also sad about this but looking at it logically the T is a seriously powerful vehicle and would be severe power creep if it had either APHE or was a normal tank.It would be like the Dicker Max spam but instead of getting one shotted by a weak slow foe youll get repeatedly hammered by an untouchable enemy that you cant even fight back. At least if you die to a Dicker Max its because you probablybarring the ridiculous RNG werent paying attention well enough to your surroundingsSide note of the note you are cheery and arent very hostile and I sincerely thank you for being open minded and amiable!,Warthunder,d3dhwht,2,t5_2uc6j

7715409,0,t1_d3j5lv1,I personally believe the Maus was an extremely potent concept. Most people say things along the lines of it would have been far too prone to aircraft to be effective I feel that in an ideal situation Maus wouldnt have been used in situations where aircraft would have been enormous threats more in the field of being a heavy assault gun like the KV more along the lines of mobile artillery. In this situation the main gun would be bombardment while the coax would be there to defend it from enemy vehicles that got too close. Keep in mind that this vehicle was built in  so had they been able to figure out its engine issues on schedule it would have been present by  in otherwords its opponents would have been mostly late Ts SUs Jumbo Shermans Cromwells and the occasional IS or Pershing. Its time of true usefulness would have been fairly short but for a time it would have been able to do the work and would be fairly effective. But the real thing with it would be similar to the nature of the tiger during late war not super effective at that point outclassed by most but would be very potent because its simply scary. Think about it the vehicle is literally the size of a small building most guns would barely scratch it and on top of that its main gun could basically vaporize most forms of vehicle. The vehicle was definitely not without flaws but you have to give credit where its due the thing was truly a feat of engineering and I feel its a real shame it never got to even see service. ,Warthunder,d3j6tls,1,t5_2uc6j

I have better things to do than sit on my butt and watch other people play video games which sadly seems to include arguing on the internet... but they arent relevant to this conversation.Given such a strong fanboy opinion repeadly without looking into the situation is questionable here. Might want to rethink your takt. If you have the time to constantly come to defend Gaijin any time a YTer leaves or Gaijin mucks up then take a look why.Given its a demonstrated abuse of the strike system. Which is core to Jingles leaving. It seems quite relevant. For refrence  gtWhat IS relevant is how youve completely forgotten to mention PhlyDailys cheat showcase and how Gaijin didnt strike it but asked him to take it down. And then rather than apologizing for doing an absolute dick move that actively hurt their game just to get some views he instead just unlisted it as if thats the same as removing it.Given much of his sentiment was abusing the cheaters id be less incinled to look at it like that. gtThen the CEO petitioned the community on what they should do allow dickweeds on Youtube to advertise hacks at the cost of having to rig up some likely gamebreaking anticheat measures or... not.Then dont use copyright strikes. If a game is so weak that its primary means of stopping cheating is to just stop people from hearing about it then they clearly should rethink their priorities.gtIf YT content usurpers want to give WT a wide berth thats totally fine... or they could just... NOT be complete assholes. This whole YT shitstorm is like when someone gets arrested for robbing a convenience store because the man is keeping him down or being racist or whatever... and not for instance because he robbed a convenience store and someone had to put a stop to that.Stop.

7884413,0,t1_d423rrn,So far Ive only flown out my  Gs and only a few matches but enough to notice a few things. When you first get in and takeoff and do a little bit of aileron input youll definitely notice its a bit slower if youre familiar with your s. I was a little worried at first honestly but once you get up to altitude and get some speed its really not so bad and I had no issues getting guns on target. It will take some getting the feel for it though. Im interested to see how this change will feel in something a bit heavier like the K. Another point Ive noticed is engine heat. I was still able to WEP quite a bit and the engine still cooled relatively quickly once I let off WEP but I can definitely tell the temperatures are more easily pushed to yellow and even red although I didnt have any issue with running into a countdown to failure or anything that extreme during normal battle use. If the rest of the s are only experiencing the same changes I dont think it will be bad. Just a slightly different feel.,Warthunder,d42a4c8,7,t5_2uc6j

7906814,0,t1_d44pefq,Hey Im not trying to muzzle you or anything. You are right when you say that you can say what you want on here its just that I happen to want to comment on your stance. There is no should or should not be related people can do whatever they want with user skins which you cant even see ingame so this really isnt an issue unless you are making it one. I am merely expressing my confusion over your dismay over this great Anime plague that irks you to the extent displayed in your comments. Then again you are free to react however you wish to whatever you wish so dont be discouraged by me. On your second point I cant help but strongly disagree. I know there isnt an International Weeaboo Census I can cite but I live and study in the SF and LA areas in California which is the undeniable home away from home of Anime and Japanese culture. Hell my highschools star quarterback was a fan of the Legend of Korra and he wasnt even Asian. I have met literally and I mean literally hundreds of individuals from countless backgrounds who watch or watched anime and I can count the stereotypical animu neckbeardsmegaweeaboos on one hand. The vast vast majority of Anime watchers are normal people with normal lives with a pinch of Anime here and there. Hell you can go to Anime Expo and even there  of the people display no overbearing Weeaboo symptoms. Like any other activityhobby ever  of particpants dont wholeheartedly shape their identities and habits around the said activity. There are almost certainly friends or acquantainces of yours who watch and enjoy anime or manga or kawaii D girls but are gasp normal people or hide it to avoid incurring the preconceptions of the Anime watcher label. And you are wrong on the manchildrenneckbeard phenomenon originating in Japan. The whole geeky recluse phenomenon has existed since the inception of video games and internet addiction and probably even earlier. Laying the blame on only anime is almost laughable. Oh and the term you are looking for is herbivore and that is widely attributed to the insanely stressful Japanese education system and work ethic along with misogynistic cultural elements. Not just the abundance of cuteor depending on your POV disgustingly inhuman anime schoolgirls.,Warthunder,d44suer,1,t5_2uc6j

7914046,0,t1_d45eqt5,Ah yes but while AB is technically the quickest and easiest way to grind up over time in my opinion its also the most mind numbing and boring. Each match is generally the same and the skill ceiling is low so you dont usually have much room to improve. My KD in arcade games is  most days and  on good matches gets boring. When you kill  planes in RB or SB on the other hand you basically singlehandedly win the game for your team and feel like a hero. Those matches are also memorable.RB and SB is high risk high reward. You might get shot down right off the bat and get  XP for your  booster...or you might get  .Arcade on the other hand youll always get the same relatively low number pretty much regardless of how well you do. Personally I find it more fun to take my chances at the k plus XP matches than just endlessly bash my head against  XP arcade games.Of course if you prefer AB none of that will be true for you. That said you say the grind is too much in AB...id argue if you were actually enjoying it grind performance is very secondary. I have tons of fun in sim games even when I do poorly and achieve little on the grind.,Warthunder,d45m3v0,1,t5_2uc6j

7934400,0,t3_4ny08l,Recently Gaijin has been interacting with the community more and glaring problems seem to be fixed more quickly. The Tu was added three days ago and in that time Gaijin increased its BR from . to . and limited the maximum number of bombers on a team in RB to  both attempting to fix issues with the Tu being difficult to approach and seeing whole teams full of Tus. Given their track record thats an incredible turnaround time although I cant personally say whether or not its entirely fixed those issues.However Gaijin being Gaijin they dont seem to do anything without somehow breaking something else. In this case a number of guns and cannons also seem to have been nerfed most mm and .mm guns especially which makes flying certain planes and countries difficult. Fires are also more difficult to set but part of thats due to a new mechanic regarding fuel tanks where its drawn from the wings first and fuselage last and filled the opposite way.BRs are still compressed at high and lower tiers but thats simply going to be the nature of the beast with T flight models and a  BR system. Tiers IIIV arent too bad if you have a complete tree.Russians being OP is largely an excuse for bad players. You have to be wary around them just like you do anything else but once you learn how to fight them theyre not so much of a problem.Forum mods are still pretty terrible as far as I know but the forum is pretty terrible anyway. Devs have started coming back here recently though most especially uantonyudintsev the CEO of Gaijin. Hes even invited us to have a beer with himBombers generally dont climb to space as much but occasionally. Not as much of an epidemic as before. Be careful of the Tu though it is very dangerous to approach even being the highestBR prop in the game and being a longrange bomber it now gets a m airspawn airdefense fighters get m interceptors m and attackers m as well. Just fair warning.Do  is just like everyone expected not really designed for War Thunder since War Thunder is all about shortrange lowtomedium altitude interception and the Do  is no interceptor. Its not garbage but its not any easier to fly than any of the other planes that dont really get to fly their intended role in War Thunder.,Warthunder,d47wgeb,3,t5_2uc6j

8077796,0,t1_d4nqzhd,Something that people need to understand is that the measurements on the statcards are only accurate under very very specific conditions some of which arent even relevant to combat.  Turn time for example measures how long it takes to do a  degree turn at a specific constant altitude at a specific constant speed.  Not a combat turn.  It tells you very little about how fast the plane will actually turn when pushed to its limit what it tells you has more to do with engine power and stability.  Rate of climb can give you a clue as to both the lift and the horsepowerthrust to weight ratio of the aircraft in question but ends up not telling you much about how well the plane actually climbs.Out of the listed stats top speed is the most straightforward of them but even that is only valid at the optimal altitude using WEP if available with manual engine control being used to control every function of the engine for top speed.,Warthunder,d4o0pxh,7,t5_2uc6j

8125800,0,t1_d4tdq0j,I wasnt driving the fastest tank so I didnt try to beat the enemy rush to the cap. I was planning to flank through the canyons but couldnt get there fast enough. You dont know when you spawn if there will be a back and forth tug of war over the cap or if one team will just hold it the entire time. If there is a struggle then you have enough time to flank and can rake in the kills. If the enemy team takes it and holds then anyone who chose to flank is irrelevant because of the terrain. Essentially you dont know if you can or cannot flank when you spawn. On other large maps its fine since you can get to where you are needed before the game can end but on El Alamein you are useless. That shouldnt be the case. If going to a part of a map will render you useless to your team block it off like the other maps.,Warthunder,d4tevwp,1,t5_2uc6j

But I shall post it anyway since I wisely included the questions as quotes in the reply so they were preserved...gt What is a superchargerA supercharger is a compressor that is driven by mechanical power from the engine and its job is to compress air and pump it into the engines intake manifold. Its one type of forced induction system.A naturally aspirated engine without a forced induction can only use air at the same pressure and density as the ambient air around the engine. This is a serious problem for aircraft both because the air density drops as you go upwards but also because naturally aspirated engines have certain limitations in terms of power relative to size and weight.Essentially any internal combustion engines maximum power is determined by how much fuel it can burn in a given amount of time and its efficiency which means how much of the heat of combustion is converted into mechanical work.In a naturally aspirated engine the only ways to increase power are increasing the energy content of the fuel impractical for a given type of fuel  it is what it is improve the thermal efficiency of the engine very difficult to do increase the engines RPM leads to problems with vibrations lubrication and overheating needs larger radiator better bearings and in general more precise engineering increase the engines displacement so that it can suck in more air and thus burn more fuel makes the engine very large and heavyAll these problems are impractical and none of them offer solutions to the problem of rarified air at high altitudes.Forced induction such as with a supercharger can increase the amount of air that goes into the engine thus making it possible to burn more fuel in a small engine without increasing the RPM  since youre pumping compressed dense air into the engine you can also burn more fuel so you have more energy to start with.A supercharger also offers a solution to the altitude problem If you can compress the air at high altitude you also get more power at high altitude.However a supercharger takes some engine power to run and compress the air. So if you optimize the engine to run well at low altitude with dense air the supercharger might not be good enough at high altitude. And if you optimize the engine to run well at high altitude the thick dense air might put too much stress on the supercharger at low altitude and you might either explode the engine from too high manifold pressure or you might just get a power loss because the engine is trying to spin the huge compressor and the dense air is resisting it.So the solution to that is making it possible to change the way the supercharger works inflight depending on altitude so that it produces low compression pressure at low altitudes and increases the compression at higher altitudes. This can be done either by changing the superchargers speed RPM either by steps or continuously or by adding more superchargers compressor stages that can be activated or deactivated to produce higher or lower compression.These are called multispeed or multistage superchargers respectively.So there you have it  a supercharger is a compressor that is run by the engine and it pumps compressed air into the engine in order to improve its power. A multispeed or multistage or both will help the engine to produce good performance at different altitudes.Then theres also turbosuperchargers which can either refer to turbochargers a compressor driven by exhaustpowered turbine in WW era like on the P Lightning or hybrids with a supercharger AND a turbocharger like on the P Thunderboltgthow do I activate it in my PWhich P model are you talking about?The first P in the game is a PA model the one with mm cannons and that one comes with an Allison V engine which has a singlespeed singlestage supercharger. This supercharger is always on and is optimized for low altitude performance. You cant do anything about it.The PD models on the other hand are a bit different. They use different variants of the Packard V Merlin engine US licensebuilt version of the RollsRoyce Merlin V engine with twospeed twostage superchargers. These superchargers normally operate at low speed at low altitudes and if you use automatic engine management they should automatically switch to high speed for high altitude operations I dont remember the crossover altitude though.If you use manual engine controls you need to bind the supercharger control keys not the turbocharger speed controls and then use them to switch between high and low speeds depending on your altitude. Consult the engine specifications or plane handbooks to figure out the correct crossover altitude.,Warthunder,d4zbhx9,18,t5_2uc6j

8225605,0,t3_4s1ipk,Posted Yesterday will answer your questionsgtLets take a trip back in time to when the the M Jackson was introduced at BR .?.What the US GF got was a upgraded M with a powered traverse and  mm M gun at a sensible BR.The  mm M is roughly the equal of the  mm KwK L of Tiger HE in terms of APHE performance and at the same BR it seem pretty fair.The US now had a TD with the mobility of a M Sherman with serious cannon that would be one shot if hit and pen but could also one shot just about any tank at its tier.This is an attribute that you look for in most of your TDs they typically sacrifice armour or mobility or turret for a better gun in comparison to the medium tanks they face and the ability to knock out heavier tanks.The BR seem reasonable it made sense if you look at the M before which got the  mm M at BR . about . BR lower than it first appears on a medium tank the BT . MA  Sherman.However what happen was the M Jackson started to one shot players precious Tigers HE and there was an uproar! How dare the US GF get a tank that could take on a Tiger HE in terms of firepower and win! How dare a US TD perform well at the role it was intended to perform!So Gaijin listened and bumped the M Jackson to the same BR as the M Pershing... and that is where we see it today?,Warthunder,d55r9ey,38,t5_2uc6j

8235304,0,t3_4s2r9s,The sustained turn rate of an aircraft is closely related to its excess power. Excess power is very closely related to but not quite the same as the climb rate but the two are close enough that they can be considered equivalent. Excess power varies based on speed and altitude and generally is the greatest somewhere around  for most jets and  for props but sometimes higher or lower.Your speed of max excess power is going to be almost exactly your best climbing speed and is also the speed at which you can sustain the highest lateral acceleration aka load factor. Whatever that load factor is is almost directly related to your rate of climb at the best speed. IIRC the Horten climbs like dogshit even at higher speeds whereas the Meteor Mk  and especially the Sea Meteor climbs fairly well even at low speeds so right there the Horten is at a disadvantage.Your max sustained turn rate will be at a point somewhere between your best climb speed and your minimum turn radius speed depending on exactly what the induced drag characteristics of the aircraft are. If theyre bad your best turning speed will be at or just below your best climb speed and your specific excess power at lower speeds can drop to stupidly low levels and your turn rate will go to shit. This is why your damn Horten turns into such a pig once it gets slow even if the minimum instantaneous turn radius which is a liftlimited thing independent of sustained turn radius is really tiny or even if the maximum instantaneous turn rate which is also a liftlimited thing independent of sustained turn rate is incredibly high.Mouse Aim will prevent you from stalling your aircraft and will give you the max instantaneous turn rate at any given point. It will not prevent you from turning harder than your maximum sustained load factor at that airspeed nor will it prevent you from falling below the speed of best turn rate and even below the speed of tightest turning radius. You can and will turn yourself into the slowasfuck area of why am I being outturned by a plane with better excess power at low speed if you dont consider  the sustained part of sustained turn performance.,Warthunder,d56yvfl,1,t5_2uc6j

8381508,0,t1_d5osjgw,I actually joined the game the patch when the BR system was introduced. At the time people were fiercely complaining about it. A few pointed out that the system was at least with regards to matchmaking not that different  previously there were  tiers now there were  BR brackets split into  eras that serve as bounds for the matchmaker. As for unlocking planes I dont know which of the systems I would prefer. I kind of like the fact that you can research the specific plane that you like. Yet on the other hand I think Gaijin used this to artificially bloat the tech tree with variants of the same plane counting as distinct things which might have alternatively been implemented by second load options skins etc.. You know those BFF or P where youre researching different variants of? I bet eventually be obligatory planes in their respective trees. I think this entire problem stems from the fact that many feel that once they have researched a tree down to the jets the game kind of ends. So as a result GJ feels they have to stretch the period until then as far as possible. I think thats not a wise decision in the long run. I think it would be far more sustainable if they had game modes or mechanics that served as an endgame. Like entire campaigns with partial PVE implementation that people could play through together.

I burned through the majority of the first half of the air trees no problem and some ground forces in that week. Hell sometimes Ive even done this stuff in a day or two. But compare that. I can go a couple days or so to grind through half a tech tree with or without premium depending on my play time per day and how good Im feeling but get to jets and even with premium it takes me days on end to make a dent in the rp and thats if Im doing good which most of the time Im not doing remotely close to good. Without it? Ill literally spend several weeks even months researching a T or T aircraft and its even worse for ground forces.

Even in the CV the graphics are almost unacceptably blurry with numerous strange effects like shimmering trees. Someone had mentioned that it might be related to the specific VR settings profile that Warthunder uses or it could have something to do with how there are so many different types of art assets and ground cover in the world vs a game like elite dangerous where its basically just a cockpit space and planets.

Most of the bombers in the game dont necessarily suffer for this but the BB and Short Sunderland really need the ability to manually open the bay extend bomb racks to eliminate the sudden change in velocity and angle after triggering first bomb drop.

If it is raining you can rotate your turret around and string a tarp over the gun for a nice makeshift tent. Youre going to be close to your hatches in case you need to get inside the tank quickly.

Like anyone who never played it before doesnt realize how big of a nerf it was and therefore people still think its OP. If you have an IT you should know how hard it is to get a missile to hit where you want it to. Your aim point shows one thing but where your missile goes is another thing and you learn that. Its not point and click the Sheridan is its point adjust for missile trajectory then click and hope to god it does what you want it to do.

8658537,0,t1_d6mt8pu,If I remember correctly remembering off the top of my head the rear  gallon fuel tank was usually empty or low on fuel by the time it hit combat.  I want to say it would be at  fuel or about  gallons which comes out to about  pounds using regular gasoline as a proxy for the fuel it would normally use.  The weight of an instructor plus the seat should be more than sufficient to actually make the plane heavier than itd reasonably be under combat conditions assuming the devs of DCS actually modeled the weight with an instructor onboard.Remember that rear fuel tank induced some significant stability problems on the PD so it was always the first bit of fuel to be burned even before external fuel tanks.  Its role after climbing and burning it low was as an emergency reserve.  Again if I am also remembering correctly.Wikipedia sourcesgt Gunston Bill. North American P Mustang. New York Gallery Books as the TFD only having  guns instead of  which is confirmed with a direct quote from that bookgtOne additional Mustang was a twoseat dualcontrol TFD  with an enlarged canopy and only four wing guns.The difference between  and  guns is rather huge.  The weight of just one of those guns by itself is put at about  pounds also wikipedia and the ammunition would throw a fair amount on top of that.  At  pounds  guns thats a lot more significant than  pounds of fuselage fuel off the guns alone.  That is unless they threw weights into the wing to simulate having actual combat loads.  If they modeled the  guns weight correctly itd only be somewhere closer to  pounds of weight difference for a reasonable overestimate of  pounds less weight.For the purposes of training pilots the difference would likely not be too significant.  For our purposes the weight difference makes itself most known in the dive.  Even though the TFD is reasonably assumed to be at least  pounds lighter than the PD all else being equal it still dove faster than the WT PD.  Only way it could manage that is if it had substantially less drag more mass andor more thrust.  Given that its mass is likely to be lower than an actual combatready PD it alludes to there being a rather significant problem related to drag or thrust in the WT PD.  That the PD only has hg for its manifold pressure with WEP thats likely where a major part of the flight discrepancy is.,Warthunder,d6nxkto,2,t5_2uc6j

8787507,0,t3_50gb6m,US planes chief weapon is Surprise Surprise and High Speed. High speed and surprise. Our  weapons Surprise High Speed and lots of . cals. Three. Our  weapons are Surprise High Speed .cals and High altitude performance. Four.  I jest.  But as a player of the flight sims for years it becomes quite apparent that in RB in war thunder. US planes just dont stack up. Why. Well Surprise actually.  Most pilots shot down in all wars never saw the plane that attacked them. And this is true for simulators as well and is the chief way to score kills in a simulator is approaching an enemy unseen and hitting them before they know theyre under attack.  A P can go as fast as it wants but if the enemy see it coming km away and rolls out of the way of a BnZ attempt... the  isnt maneuverable enough to try and press that attack.  The markerspotting system in the game is the chief cause of this. Everyone can see you coming from km away unless you can line up with the sun behind you. Which means more maneuverable planes can just turn evade your attacks while building energy and draining yours.You can do some energy fighting by zoomclimbing over a target and coming back down in a dive on them But even then many US aircraft just dont have the maneuverability to pull this off well. And the mouseaim offers wildly unrealistic levels of accuracy to planes that are flying at critically low speed in prophangs.  Id argue it they ran an event for a few weeks Ever day have a team square off with another but make it so RB markers were only good out to km youd see US planes performing disproportionately well compared to how they usually do.,Warthunder,d7441hp,13,t5_2uc6j

8828520,0,t3_513p8s,Thats a relatively new feature . I guess. See in the research tree there are arrows connecting aircraft vertically. These arrows means that you have to make the research in that specific order.Now note that there is no arrow between P and P. Meaning the P is not a prerequisite for the P as soon as you unlock tier  you can research the P. Same for FUd. Both aircraft have no other prerequisite than unlocking tier .Gaijin did this to make the grind faster. They disconnected several branches for all nations in both air and ground mostly between T T and T. That way its faster to go to higher tiers. ,Warthunder,d792cqp,16,t5_2uc6j

Makes sense to keep people from getting to Era V by going through only a few machines. Now as more tanks are being added there is little reason for them to remain so low.

Its slope is useless. I watch Panther Ds get popped at long range all the time in a single shot as I bounce thanks to my angled hull.

It takes focus away from gunnery and puts focus on flying which is the important bit to master anyway. Once you start becoming good at gaining and holding a position like that on your target be it to glue onto his tail like a leech or to repeatedly pass that close by BnZ the gunnery will come naturally and youll be able to gradually increase firing ranges and angles of deflection.It is of course complicated a bit by that Gaijin lets us hear other planes from inside the cockpit which is a stupid thing they should get rid of so it makes surprise hard to achieve but even then it is still a good way to do and learn combat.,Warthunder,d7sw6w0,3,t5_2uc6j

9028695,0,t1_d7x3ehf,That sounds pretty well done. Tiger H only has marginal pen on a Churchills front  mm pen versus  mm armour so a bit of angling can work but theres a weak point in behind the tracks at an angle from the front that seems to be only  mm thick as lots of tanks can pen through there. So I often avoid angling against weak opposition but its worth it against a Tiger. Hetzers the medium  mm with what around  mm of standard APHE pen so not an immediate threat head on. I think they might get APCR though which would easily get through.Tough old bird the Churchill VII. My best was in a low tier match when I had about  enemy all shooting at me I was tracked almost the whole time but they rarely penned and I took them out one at a time while holding a cap point. Great fun until an aircraft unloaded a few bombs on top while I was still repairing the tracks...IS though that  mm should obliterate you regardless of angle over  mm of pen plus mininuc HE filling.,Warthunder,d7x3v30,1,t5_2uc6j

Panthers LFP might be actually better this patch since transmissions became much better at absorbing hits.Ts turret can become impenetrable or nearly impenetrable to  at certain ranges or when angled which gun is better is arguable T has better depression better side armor on turret one more crew member insanely roomy turret with huge breach to absorb hits also I have heard people say that it is more mobile  but that is not something that I have personally tested.

However when someone only plays Realistic andor Simulator everything gets a little more expensive.In Realistic and Simulator the repair costs are a lot higher then in Arcade. When youre not that good or fly Japan you can lose SL each match. Also high tier tanks can steal a lot of SL due to the expensive ammunition HEATFS you have to fire to be competitive.Another way to lose a lot of SL is to spend it on your crews to get Expert qualification for your vehicles. Especially on high tiers that can be very expensive.Ive seen people complain about being broke all the time and having to grind for SL just te be able to buy a new vehicle.

Most German tanks have ammo storage on the sides around the tank midpoint horizontally.Ms have a square plate on the side behind which there is ammo stored.

I would usually stard by treating it as a fat Typhoon that could turnfight if you somehow lost the energy advantage so long as you werent turnfighting something stupid like a Zero. Drop combat flaps when below kmh? and not many planes can keep up with you. Now its lower it should be comparatively easier.As others have said though where it really shines is RBGF.  RP rockets is an excellent ground attack load and can net you a lot of kills in one run with practice and favourable maps. Most of the planes you face wont be as good at turnfighting as you unless someone brings out a dedicated fighter and turnfighting is all that most opponents can do if theyre not coming over from SB. Plus I find the slight spread on the Hispano Vs is actually beneficial in RBGF whereas the IIs tend to be laser accurate  great when you have a precise range reading but can mean a lot of misses without it.,Warthunder,d8n361a,1,t5_2uc6j

MA is arguably the worst out of them. considering it has some of the worst mobility and armor. but makes for a great late game tank. especially the  model.  I actualyl havent used the MA yet  MA  is amazing. best armor on a non jumbo sherman. great mobility. and the  has great pen. the HE shells arent all that useful unfortunately but that heat will wreck. the only problem with it is the turret traverse speed.,Warthunder,d91y4vb,-4,t5_2uc6j

For tanks its my second most unlocked nation would be the first if Britain didnt have so few tanks to go through.. I think the most ironic bit of this is that youre flair says your highest is Germany at tier V yet Im the biased one lol.gtYoure somehow trying to argue that the Dicker Maxs shit speed and non existent armor isnt a drawbackHuh? I literally said So its drawback is speed and armour two things that it never relies on. Thats a very little drawback.. The tank isnt meant to ever rely on those things its not how its used. Is the drawback of a Lancaster its inability to dogfight? By definition yes but youd be insane to argue that with any sort of meaning.Im genuinely confused...Why try and paint me as some biased liar just because I have the audacity to disagree with you? Just to reiterate my original comment said Their tanks have very little drawbacks which would induce frustration that other nations can have depression penetration armour which makes them fantastic.Which is true...Look at all trees and compare them.

Gunwise the  is brilliant when it pens with APCBC which almost never happens from the front against your opposition but a shot from the side usually one shots the enemy tank for me.Even with the somewhat sloped .mm plate you will have less effective armor than a panther so dont count on it stopping many rounds at this point. Going hull down is a great option.Overall try not to face anything with the front. Even if the M gets HEAT the overall glassiness of the American medium line at this BR makes a frontal engagement pretty unsustainable. ,Warthunder,d9em5pb,5,t5_2uc6j

Having little armor against HEATFS isnt any different than other Tier Vs and its strong enough to club when downtiered and the low penetration doesnt matter too much since all American tanks have shit armor other than the T the Germans have only one tank to be scared of and the British are..........British.So really the only thing that severely impedes my gameplay with the Ts is the Unholy Turret Traverse.

9728796,0,t1_dabwogg,Pak s would have still been pretty common at the end of the war. I mean anything they could of gotten their hands on would have been used. And a  is plenty adequate against a Sherman. Its a lighter gun so you can move it around a target much easier and across larger distances. The weight of AT guns was a really important problem because bigger guns needed horses or vehicles to move them but they get stuck in mud slower to set up heavier ammunition more expensive to produce and therefore there arent as many of them. A  is actually a really good AT gun. It also only takes  people to operate it. I think its team was  not sure but an mm would have been a lot more then that.

9928847,0,t1_db1qmr6,gtSheridan had ERA in real life too.Can you show me where the Sheridan had ERA? I have never seen a Sheridan with actual ERA beyond fake mock up T conversions.The MA did get ERA though much more towards the s.The UK Chieftain had the stillbrew armor package which as I understand it was a composite armor mostly designed to defeat MM and to a lesser extent MM APFSDS rounds. I think some Jordanian Chieftains may have been given ERA.The T never had ERA that I have seen. Doing more reading I see lots of Ts with various ERA and composite armor but never the T.The Leo never got ERA it got some spaced armor upgrades.The Leo up until current models did not get ERA it got spaced armor and various composite armors.The T and the MA are currently the only talks in the game that actually received ERA. I believe an Israeli version of the Centurion did receive some ERA in later models but never the British models. We are starting to see a lot of confusion between ERA and Composite armor. Composite armor was much more common. The US for whatever reason along with most of NATO lagged behind in both composite and ERA up until just about the s seeing it as too expensive. The US had developed a good composite armor in the late s I believe it was but deemed too expensive and difficult to manufacture. Different composite armors were designed to defeat different kind of rounds the Stillbrew focused on Kinetic the early Soviet composites worked against both KE and HEAT The USUK composite armor worked on both heat and KE. Spaced armor of German tanks worked against both though as I remember better against HEAT.Up until the Abrams the US tanks could be frontally penned at great ranges by pretty much any tank in a Category A or B Soviet division along with shoulder fired rockets and anti tank guided weapons. That is what eventually lead to the M  Leo and Challenger being developed.Without properly modeled composite armor just slapping ERA on everything is a historical abomination I would like to see composite armors developed along with ERA or else its going to either benefit too few tanks or be historically inaccurate.,Warthunder,db1r5my,16,t5_2uc6j

9944700,0,t1_db3qv0t,I agree with you on some levels here but I have to disagree with you a lot. First and foremost we need to realize that development resources and personnel cant be switched around easily. Theres a team working on introducing new tanks and one focused on introducing new planes. Theyve got a good workflow going and they can pump out new vehicles at a good clip.Now the people working on this stuff CANT be switched over to working on other parts of the game. First my guess is a lot of the work involved is art making the textures for the tanks. But even the programmers there cant easily be switched over to fixing balance or engine eg track ricochet problems. You would break up the workflow balance and game mechanics require game designers and fixing engine problems is a very different kind of programming than working in the engine to tune tank parameters. Not to mention that people really seem to want new vehicles. Look at this subreddit like  of the posts here are begging Gaijin to implement new vehicles. So theyve got a system set up to pump out new stuff changing it will slow down the flow of new stuff for a long time and people are constantly begging for new stuff.The biggest problem I see with Gaijin is a tendency to bite off more than they can chew and an almost naive enthusiasm. I think this gets them into trouble a lot I think the current GF RB problems at . are a result of this. They just wanted to add vehicles in as fast as they could and created a fantastic synergistic German lineup at that BR. Maybe this was on purpose to please the Wheraboos but their largest player base is in Russia and I cant imagine that having the IS get constantly slammed by Tiger s and Panthers is a good business strategy in that market.Hopefully after they add boats they stop and take a good look at the fundamental Game mechanics. I hope they do this before trying to add some metagame World War mode.,Warthunder,db3thrl,4,t5_2uc6j

Low tier planes all fall apart versus tanking hits like tier .I guess airframes might be stronger in general but I cant imagine a huge difference.  Are later aircraft really that much reinforced?  I can see modern jets have so much excess thrust and pull higher G forces so they are probably stronger but early jets had barely enough thrust to get airborne.

10125774,0,t3_5kxqa3,The Battle Rating BR is the variable used by the matchmaking. Basically your planes BR decides what it will be matched against.The more advanced an aircraft is the higher its battle rating. The plane is more performant but meets stronger enemies.  The two do not exactly cancel each other because sometimes a plane has a battle rating much lower than what it should example German PD. And sometimes a plane works wellbad for its current BR.If you have a full lineup consisting of several aircraft your total battle rating will be equal to the battle rating of your highest aircraft with an exception allowing to lower it by a single step e.g. from . to . but you cannot go lower. Its not an average value or something. Suppose you have the German PD . the Cr  . and He  .. Your total battle rating will be . which means you may be matched against . aircraft.Yes the German PD is the same aircraft as the PD present in the US air tree. The difference is that the German one does not have access to bombs and rockets but has a lower battle rating and a different synergy with other planes in your lineup Arcade or in your team Realistic as US and German planes are quite different.

The angled armor on the Tortoise also melts to the Jagdtiger that the Tortoise sees nearly every game.

The Ferdinand literally has no MG port.  It also has a gun that can reliably oneshot opponents where the Tortoise fires spitballs.  For a tortoise to even stand a chance at oneshotting a Ferdinand you need to flank.

10162116,0,t1_dbvwxwx,I agree it is still rough.  Just watched a guy in a Panther II with full white camo and bushes all over front of tank simply drive right through three allied tanks. Bulldog M and a T.  It was point and shoot.  I was the only one that managed to hit the turret.  Knocked it out he backed away.  Before I could get the second shot off got taken out by a Russian SU something.  So it is not just the maps.  But also the players. They were all in the open and never once backed away from the Panther. He simply point and shot.  Not one of them even dropped arty moved into cover.  It was surreal watching this Panther strut through like he knew he could not be touched.  And the weird part about it was as I was watching he never once stopped and  Im guessing here look around to see if he was being flanked.  Honestly right now the best way to play AmericanBritish Russian vs. Germany is to slow walk and let the Germans come to you.  Get into position and let them walk into the ambush.  But it does not happen. To many maps are way to small for that.  And too many AmericanRussian MT players rush in and get one shot.

10230261,0,t1_dc3muax,gt Yeah Ill be honest I dont really care to argue that because air combat is so fucked up at the moment that nothing can save US teams but a full objective rework. FFB And FF if they ever fix it PMN and PD are competitive against German latewar props and can even fight the actual i.e. nonfiction Me s with some skill involved though its an uphill battle.I think we can leave it at that but Ill note that from what Im reading you dont want either the US or I think Russia to get any jets at all which I disagree with. gt Youre forgetting the M. And no thats not precisely a fair fight but my vision of what WT should be doesnt involve the WWII cutoff happening in a vacuum. Change the spawns change the objectives change the mechanics and yes that lineup could absolutely be a fair fight.We all want pretty massive changes to the game and I like the idea of enduring conflict the events we had a while ago where you got assigned a lineup of three vehicles per battle etc. But there are several problems with it. The only way I could see those lineups being fair for all battles all the time not just events would be if the Allied team greatly outnumbers the Germans or if most of the German team is forced to use the much lowertier vehicles which I dont think people would enjoy.. Gaijin is never going to wipe out a couple dozen vehicles and say Sorry end of WWII cutoff. I dont see much of a point in talking about it if its not going to happen.I completely agree that captured premium aircraft are a terrible idea I truly hate the Japanese Corsair. Some captured tanks are fine in my opinion lendlease tanks in the Brit tree and postwar foreign vehicles to flesh out the GermanJapanese lines I like as well. P is fine as a Soviet fighter.gt and only present in the game if they saw combat.I think this is a bad and arbitrary mechanic. It has nothing to do with how a vehicle performs how many were made how long it served anything that actually matters. Same for prototypes we dont model reliability or maintenance so if it was built and fully tested I think we can see it. Regular tree if it fits well and fills a hole premium if the tree doesnt need it.,Warthunder,dc3nobo,1,t5_2uc6j

10319709,0,t1_dcdjwed,I have wondered about this effect myself as my battle logs often have stretches that look like OPs. I dont think even in AB that the VD ratio for a given player should be random i.e. roughly  at all.A counterexample is the effect that we see when one or two players essentially carries the team to victory.  the guys with  air kills or who steamroll all the ground units within a minute or so etcObviously the outcome of a given match is affected by the average performance of the people on a team relative to the average performance on the other team where average is a level set in that particular match.  This seems like a trivial point but to take it to our perspective as individuals on a team we have to play above average consistently in order to increase the chances of the team winning.  If our performance in a match happens to be off or we are otherwise not playing to our strengths for example when bringing out a new vehicle the overall chance for the whole team goes down pretty dramatically in my belief much more than just the proportion represented by you versus the number of people on the team.  I am unable to express this clearly as I do not have a good statistics background but there surely is some branch of mathematics that demonstrates that your own VD ratio is not just random chance for a given match in a team game.,Warthunder,dcdsni8,3,t5_2uc6j

10393062,0,t1_dcm2ezm,Oh boy you have not seen the  ive seen. Back then it was easily  max at the time fw  Ds with some Bf  Gs or Ks or Me s or some bomber like the HE  or Ju  but due to small bomb fixes at the time these bombers can easily kill like half the ground units on the match in the first  minutes of match especially on sicily or ruhr when the allies have  tank columns for targets but besides that...You got a whole team of Fw  Ds and your team? British the nation I played back then it was mostly spitfire Is some IIs typhoon maybe more Ias then Ibs due to back then MGs were good  a wellington maybe some nimrods and perhaps a few blenheims and hurricanes.Why was it like this? Well Spitfire mk IX back then didnt perform any different then say a spitfire mk Vb  the Griffons didnt exist back then the Tempest FM was borked and the Mosquito and Beaufighter was superior fightersSpeaking of the beaufighter back then it was known as the Brokenfighter and it wasnt because it was UP but it was OP! It was once the most durrable aircraft in game and the mk  beaufighter had  .mms and   mms not  .mms and s and it could out turn any german fighter so it was a beast...Back then the best way to kill a Fw  as UK was with a Beaufighter Mosquito or Typhoon... not a spitfire or tempest.For USA? oh god it was horrible this was back when USA was the WORST nation in game... the brand new B that was meant to help USA in patch . had a tragic bug in which its right gear leg is always on breaks when you try to take off you spin in circles. It was a  way trip to and from combat. USAs best plane of this time was the P perhaps or the FF but it was far from on par with the Fw  D.Russia? La the La back then was just a  with a different skin... the UFO russian bias all started with La in WT it couldnt stall it can literally do vertical landings on carriers and airfields back then and due to this it can do lots of BS evasive actions to fw  trying to BnZ it and those twin s were powerful...By the time you saw Fw  Ds its just a shadow of its former self. Planes in what we know now as tier  can easily kill and handle them compared to say a P trying to kill an uber Fw  pre nerf.Even though these times sound horrible... it was very fun... it was fun side climbing for  minutes and seeing how so many fw  D players have NO idea what to do when you are not  km bellow them.It was funny killing them in my beaufighter and havoc mk I and hurricane... and the following patch that fixed them I miss how the MM had a much large spread BUT even spread... you can see as many hurricanes as he s but you can also see as many bf s as spitfires and as many me s as beaufighters and some tempests and fw s and stuff. It was cool as even if you are a bad fighter there are always targets you can go for and if you are the lowest BR fighter you can always go for their ones or for ground targets... its sort of like enduring confrontation or RB ground battles on how you can see an Il but the next guy that strafes you is a Tu or Su.,Warthunder,dcm4biq,2,t5_2uc6j

10462787,0,t3_5pv0wi,STB is actually a fantastic tank. The UFP when used right can deflect even Chieftains APDS Ts APFSDS because they think its a Leopard PTurret is actually respectably armored like the Leo AA along with stronger side armor so shilkas and m vulcans have a tough time flanking you PPlus actual gun depression!Now the Type  is a sad sad tank. Its only slightly better than the T and when the Type  gets its historical ammo loadout with APDSFS namely even better than the Ts then we could have a top contender for being among the Top  tanks in War Thunder. excluding ATGMs of courseA lot of inexperienced people are going to say the mm spall shield behind the mm gun mantlet is what makes this tank good but given you have the whole rest of the turret to aim at frontally its situational at best.It also doesnt have gun depression which plays into its poor UFP. The mm thats above the mm plate will be your death as anything cuts through it. Since you want to depress the tank for more gun depression you end up exposing that mm UFP more than the mm...So basically as I said above its a slightly better T in how its targeted and played.Now.. the Type  is an absolute atrocity.

10463655,0,t3_5pvc1p,I think the diagnosis is spot on but the issue runs deeper. in all modes but sim you get too much gun time on target thanks to mouse aim. this multiplies the effectiveness of small caliber high rof machinegun bursts and has been countered at times either by nerfing small caliber damage .x or buffing damage models .x. the problem is that all weapons that rely on single shot kills now have to face the improved damage models that have been tuned to provide a realistic feel to the uncanny amount of . cal you can get on target thanks to the extreme accuracy allowed by the abrb modes. there do remains a couple shells that have the right combination of hepensensitivity to be effective but are the exception rather than the norm.I think that tuning damage is overall a patchwork solution that will always make people unhappy but balancing for mouse aim is going to be extremely hard maybe ultimately impossible because youd keep oscillating between overperforming mg or underperforming cannons.but since this is an air posts just sideclimb bro.,Warthunder,dcu5tzp,29,t5_2uc6j

Yet you can still buy winter camos for new vehicles like LVT ZiS Type  and ZiS. Then they said its because they give too much of an advantage in winter maps.

10551194,0,t1_dd3eucs,i fully understand what you mean. I was a pure AB player at the beginning as the rest. To a certain point I realized one thing I wasnt really training myself in AB in order to play RB. Instead I was learning the wrong to fly in AB which makes it even harder to switch to RB. And no. Flying stock in RB isnt suicide. in RB performance isnt everything. You have so much more to think about plan execute and fail. It was until that moment I realized going to RB after about  AB battles is more than enough if you already have a midtier  plane. And i regret so much that i kept playing AB for so long and had to relearn the whole thing again in RB performance tactic teamwork etc.,Warthunder,dd43had,1,t5_2uc6j

Taking the T to the test drive range all the shrapnel shells would only explode on contact out to the Jagdtiger at about  meters.This is probably intentional since having it only explode on contact would make it slightly better for antiarmor use  basically a really wimpy HEAT shell. But it also doesnt exactly explode in a normal shotgun spread of pellets either it explodes pretty similar to an HE shell with fragments going every which way.So pretty much in War Thunder its an HE shell with slightly more penetration. And with it that risk of overpenetration and not setting off the fuze against sheet metal.,Warthunder,dd6guqa,4,t5_2uc6j

10623838,0,t1_ddblu9m,It looks like you chose a pretty tough angle to draw the plane from but still pretty much nailed it.The one thing I have to say though is the zoomed in scale of the background vs the small plane in the foreground implies that a more distant camera with zoom lens was used for this picture. The way the horizontal stabilizer is sticking almost straight at the viewer while the wing is at an oblique angle implies that a wider angle lens was used and the camera was very close to the plane. This contradiction makes it look like the tail of the plane is warped to the left however in this case the effect is actually not very noticeable thanks to the low contrast of the plane.,Warthunder,ddbrno9,2,t5_2uc6j

Nosemounted guns are what I normally get my best results with as convergence concerns are not a factor so I am baffled by my terrible results with this thing.My problem with the AM is that I never got a handle on the gunnery even after spading it and I found the engine to be VERY vulnerable to damage.  So I scrapped it as a bomber hunter.I am flyingspading the BA now and know that in the right hands it can be a real threat.  Well see if I can make it work.Thanks to this thread I am feeling better about the Ki line.

As you say some dive and some stay high.  Your own team is equally split and there are very few fighters to share the load of trying to halt the onslaught.  As bombers tend to wreck my plane after on high speed pass AND I am more interested in building skills taking on fighters I tend to ignore bombers now and target any escorting fighters. I am a little over the  magazines to scratch a bomber DMs.   I would rather the community get into their bombers and ground pound the heck out of the tech trees as this will get Gaijins full attention.

10732943,0,t1_ddn0j3j,Im pretty new to this game if that wasnt obvious and your post raises a few questions. Isnt all of the armor sloped or angled? Wouldnt that make this shell terrible in every situation against every tank? Whats manual angling? And is HE really that bad?,Warthunder,ddn0tsx,1,t5_2uc6j
10733174,0,t3_5tjkko,Being good in first tier is pretty straightforward since you just need to shoot any tank to killcripple it. But to be successful later you really need to understand tank armorlayoutshell.  To learn about shell go check the wiki about it. Then look at the type of shell you have and their specs armor penetration ricochet  explosive size.  To learn about the armor using the preview option go check and study enemy armor you are facing ie same BR. The tool let you know the armor thickness angle and effective thickness.Finally I recommend you play a little bit of Arcade to learn aiming and week spot. Arcade provide an aim assist to guide you which you should be able to learn from. For the MA the M is best for penetration shoot but M will do much more damage if it can penetrate. You should bring both and use one or the other depending on the situation flank shot vs front shot. Some nation ex Russia has it more easy with shell that can both penetrate and explode.As for HE shell they just recently last week become more relevant with the new mechanic for nonarmored and lightlyarmored vehicles. You should bring some of them  in case you encounter one of these vehicles. The MA  has HE shell which are kinda fun to use . kg of explosive fun.PS Dont bring too much shell or you will augment the chance of explosion ammo rack. You can check the amount of shells per tank  to minimize the chance of ammo rack.,Warthunder,ddn1oq4,2,t5_2uc6j

10747303,0,t1_ddogmze,Yep but worked well IRL they used the filler for other explosives. Explosive shells IRL werent  reliable for any nation so simply upping the pen which penning tanks cause people to bail out most of the time and thus HE filler wasnt necessary... technically speaking the Sherman shouldnt get the HE filler either...Also back when the British had APHE rounds for pdrs they also removed the HE filler later on as the damage increase was not noticeable...Also they removed the pintle aa .mms of the shermans they got as they think infantry somewhere say in a trench foxhole or in the bushes or anything is far better then some guy standing on top of the tank.Many things good IRL bad in game.,Warthunder,ddoi3k1,13,t5_2uc6j

I hope that doesnt turn people away from completing this survey as it is brilliantly thought out.One thing I would like to say OP is that just because boats are small doesnt mean that they belong in Rank I. If they are to have a spot in the game mode and their own spawn it is obvious you recognize their agility and potent potential that could win battles against larger ships. I think they should progress through the ranks just as light tanks do with gunboats and torpedo boats spread over all tiers. That is my only critique ,Warthunder,ddpdjag,12,t5_2uc6j

10784126,0,t1_dds4zfk,Wait I figured out my thought process.So basically the popular German prototypes are obviously things like the E or a which require very little effort to model since half or more of the model is already in game.  Stuff like the IS or T arent in game and thus require them to be modeled from the ground up.  Stuff like the YP are possible gifts  but like the La itll have relatively little buzz about it since it is neither well known nor unique.  But why things like the E or a are pretty popular because theyre either unique well known or both.  Hence why theres also been so much buzz around the IS as of late because it is both well known and unique and why people really were hyped about the Type .  Its also the reason why people didnt really care too much about the Iron Duke Comet or the KV  because while they are cool and stuff the KV is functionally another KV  with a worse turret and the Comet is another Comet with some decals as opposed to the a which provides a unique attacker role for the Germans in T and the E which plays like a Maus but isnt a Maus.  ,Warthunder,ddsayg6,1,t5_2uc6j

Torpedo tubes detonate when theyre empty the gunsight has the same control issue as are in GF around walls except to the extreme I have been literally unable to shoot when a small object has been slightly near my boat The green circles are where its firing the red is aimed ofc crews dont properly replace dead essential members on many boats boats can still fire while displaying no ammo the list goes on.There is very very limited feedback for fires and damage most people are entirely unaware of how to kill a boat and it is not explained anywhere but that at least can be remedied easily enough. There are extreme balance issues but thats moderately expected at this point in time. Theres nil thematic draw. Actual tactical gameplay has some promise with the larger boats we got  weeks back but anything smaller is worse than SPAA on water. I dont want to call them DoA but unless the major outstanding bugs are fixed and things drastically improve when multiple classes of boats are in the same match Im going to have to assume that for now ,Warthunder,deh0px6,15,t5_2uc6j

11044680,0,t1_deiiq2r,Welp here we go...Panther II is far from made up since the hull for it was made. The mm is not made up on paper and there were many other Panther IIs proposed out there. The Panther II had many proposals. This is where the fantasy comes in though as the mm Panther much like the pdr Cromwell Comet  Bishop Sexton etc... was put down for something more practical in which case was just the ordinary mm.Panther II with  mm isnt made up just never built not intended to be the Panther II that was being built and isnt practical. Tiger  is where things get a bit harder the designers knew right off the bat it wasnt practical and it wasnt simply for it being a bigger gun but it was the fact that it was barely noticeably better much like the APHE ammo in a pdr it barely did anything better but costed far more to do. There was no reason for a mm tiger to exist and thats why it wasnt built. Not because it was impossible but just because it caused far to many issues for barely anything done effectively.Also since the  tiger is more controversial then the Panther IIImage   Drawing of Tiger with a mmImage   Another useful image.In short the other reason it never went through was that the gun was never finished. Much like how the RY never came to existence because the factory that was making the engines for it was bombed and destroyed with only  engine produced.Completely made up vehicles? Nope.Never built? Yes. Apart from a Tiger II hull since the  tiger is just a variant and the Panther II hull which still exists til today.We got both vehicles as they fill a higher BR area in germany without doing post war copys like using Pattons and stuff. Is it better this way? I cant say.My biggest problem is the fact the mm Tiger has an extra crew member right behind the gun He shouldnt even be alive if the gun fired.,Warthunder,dejw8jl,1,t5_2uc6j

T might also not get to do anything from long ranges but they are also better than is at closer range. Mobility of the is is great improvement compared to is or is. but as the BR range is god awful it doesnt mean anything. its a waste of money as it really suffers from the same problems as IS did is does and ism does which  being just terrible compared to their respected counterparts the armor is irrelevant and they really just can be funplayable when undertiered. i really do hope its a placeholder atm. tldr it can only be used when downtiered when under mm against players that are worse than you and when flanking enemies effectively not worth for the price atm.And for anybody that says ehhhehehe. its balanced you can kill leo and it can kill you russian bias.fuck off russians are the worst nation to play competitively.Cheers enjoy the day.,Warthunder,detbym1,2,t5_2uc6j

A Duck with a mm peppering a vodkatruck can usually easily disable at least its gun before getting within range where its reasonably easy to hit. What helps is that the German SPAAGs are summarily the best and most numerous of all of them.Allied attackers can have a great time when Axis doesnt bother with anti air defence.

Frankly it takes skill to work those flat plates for your own good and the tank being so well known means the weak spots are fairly well known. I love mine but I seem to always get uptiered with it and it gets expensive fast to use. The German tech tree is mostly from the WW mindset of an iron mobile bunker.

Second it is cheap to repair and it adds up quite fast and D is around K a wreck.         As for someone diving on your . One option is to roll under his approach vector to give him most awkward angle. PD in fact turns really well but lose energy very fast so bare that in mind.

11413892,0,t1_dfphv2c,I totally get what you mean. MagzTV did a video on this issue saying if you take out a person in the early game you potentially took out  enemy tanks because the enemy player doesnt have the spawn points to move onto his second or third vehicles.

Most of the complaints Ive seen regarding naval following the initial announcements and playtests have been people who bought into PT boats defended it or were at least apprehensive about instantly shunning it then played and found out that they didnt enjoy it as much as they thought they would.  From what Ive heard speaking to people in the test there are flaws with the game mode that happens regardless of if you compare it to hypothetical BB combat or not.  I havent played it but the impression I got was not that its just the community backlash from no BBs but that the game mode itself is flawed.As an aside if the flaws really are because nobody wants to play PTs over BBs thats a much bigger issue Gaijin needs to sell a product and if nobody wants it then its not going to ever get the market penetration needed to have reasonable queues and continue growth,Warthunder,dg09pbc,7,t5_2uc6j

Most people keep their sensitivity at  as it is just a delay between input and control surface response deadzones are the way to go and just get in their and play with them youll figure it out.  I use default deadzones none i believe but my stick isnt very sensitive.  Setting up controls in WT is kitten play compared to some flight sims.  Your throttle looks nice and has keys on it personally I would use the throttle you can bind rudder keys to it if you want but a lot of people use twist rudder and I think it gives you more precise control but then again I use pedals.  I bind radio calls for cover me and guide on me to throttle buttons.  also plane ignition but I have lots of buttons.  Planes are tricky to fly at first but after lotsamplots of practice it will all seem intuitive and you will become one with the plane able to push her to her limits with your nice hotas setup.

11700126,0,t1_dgljuqz,The FU isnt the one that has it real bad thou and even then it is defeating the purpose of instructor. I would rather the plane P mostly use less smooth rudder and stay on target than what we have  which is oscillations. I Know the P was unstable on the yaw axis  when its longrange tank was full. But it was quite stable in combat settings. In addition when you mose the cursor instructor will initiate turns with bizzare inputs such as full rudder and not enough aileron. Ill try to correct this with the keys but it will insist on a hard rudder un coordinated turn making aiming impossible.Instructor is a terrible problem on some planes but not in all.,Warthunder,dgm87su,1,t5_2uc6j
