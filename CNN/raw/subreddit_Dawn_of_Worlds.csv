11038668,0,t3_5ws34s,Deity Bafaat the InsaneDomain Mania Depression Dementia Psychosis Delusion etc.Personality Bafaat is predictably unpredictable. In itself much like its followers the unexpected is to be expected. Many aspects of his domain are predictable to the extent that the behaviour of its followers can be expected to behave in a way that is unusual. At a moments notice however Bafaat can and will exert their will in a way that leaves one scratching their head. Bafaat changes his own form in a seemingly random fashion. Nothing about this god makes sense.,Dawn_of_Worlds,dej7p70,1,t5_3jb3m

11411694,0,t3_61zow1,One half of the Lifecrafters party changed direction and went north following rumors. They heard of a city of Dare and within it a race known as Daltunn that were followers of Klaaang. The Pueryvi traveled for many days and nights through wheat fields and grasslands until they finally saw someone in the forest next to and area known as the Bay of War. A humanoid creature of similar size to the Pueryvi. They prepared the gifts they were bringing  Tarykki milk Canabium and masterful quality leather  and rode towards the being they hoped was a Daltunn attempting to greet it once they got close enough.ulordnotix,Dawn_of_Worlds,dfpi590,1,t5_3jb3m
