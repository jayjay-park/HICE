603967,0,t3_2122o9,The main issue for you will be getting the bars low enough but this easy to fix with the right stemhandlebar combo.  Some people me included really like the way a er handles but some dont so make sure you test it on actual trails.,29er,cg8xal6,2,t5_2tchq

645533,0,t3_21hw89,Rented a bike there a few years ago for the day. The guy at the shop said pick a recognizable rock formation you can find your way back to and just GO. I did exactly that. Spent a few hours following whatever trail I felt like and then found my way back to Lizard Rock. Awesome experience.,29er,cgdnb9t,1,t5_2tchq

848370,0,t1_ch0lq7z,I disagree. Its also reckless to tell someone to remove reflectors just because people like you will judge them at the trailhead. If he ever intends to ride to the trailhead he should really leave the reflectors.,29er,ch0ppgj,2,t5_2tchq

1255732,0,t1_ciavqci,yeah the only reference to impac tires i can find is here on this sub of another person complaining about how little traction they have. just about any replacement tire would probably be worlds better,29er,ciavv6h,1,t5_2tchq

4788875,0,t1_cty635z,That may be the grip issue right there. PSI is very high even for a smallish cross country tire. I was close to  about a year and a half ago and on my rigid SS with . tires I run something like  front  rear. Try lowering your tire pressure to psi and rear and go for a ride if you dont have any sort of issues with a snakebite flat try letting a little bit more out on your next ride. Again at lbs with tubes I could get away with  in the front and  in the rear I tried  in the rear and got a flat. ,29er,cty6dap,2,t5_2tchq
4806184,0,t1_ctzyf15,No creaking just the front brakes breaking in and rubbing a little. ,29er,cu0cxsi,1,t5_2tchq
4817512,0,t1_cu1gj0u,I have  rides under my belt with the SLX brakes and theyre plenty for the trails around here. Never have I felt as if they didnt have enough stopping power. I also decided to just do the full set because the Tektros have almost no feel to them compared to the SLX. They definitely felt onoff and had very little modulation.  finger braking is also the tits. I couldnt imagine having a different front than back! The difference in level feel would probably really throw me off. Also I got a really good deal on the whole set. It was the entire brake system front and back  new rotors  the adaptor for the new mm rotor and all new hardware to install everything with for . Gotta love eBay!Edit Also in response to you being able to lock up your rear with the Tektro brakes. The thing I love the most about the new brakes is how i DONT have to lock up the rear wheel. There are definitely situations where Ive been able to brake harder than the Aurigas but still keep the wheel spinning which helps with traction. But if I do want to lock up and slide my back end out all it takes is another halfinch of squeezing my right finger and it locks instantly.,29er,cu1sc4a,1,t5_2tchq

6149777,0,t1_cynsbj6,i was running Ground Control up front and a Fast Trak Control on the rear they are the  tires that came on it and they dont really do well in the snow but its doable. really thinking about just giving in and getting a fat bike... but winters here really suck ,29er,cyonym7,1,t5_2tchq

8960840,0,t3_52xshn,Ive also contemplated this.  I have a  Genesis Longitude that is currently running x. wheels. The frame is able to accommodate inch tires but only if I convert from a x to a x setup which Im not sure I want to do.  I believe this is because the outside diameter of the wheel increases so that it fouls the inner chainring.If I ran .x wheels instead the outside diameter of the wheels is around mm less than the current setup so Im hoping itll clear the inner chainring.  I think Ill have to spend some time with a tape measure and the bike up on a stand ,29er,d7oyie9,2,t5_2tchq
