7893763,0,t3_4n6qwl,Id look into the rebuild intervals. Its not hard to do a top end rebuild and pretty cheap parts wise usually. Not sure how youd go with an old bike like this though.   ampnbsp  Another thing to check is whether the reed valves for the engine if it has any are reliable or not. They werent on my RGV and I you had to check them every so often to ensure they didnt move down and touch the piston like was happening with one of the  cylinders after Id bought it seemed to run okay though. Looks like the RG pre  only had some sort of valving mechanism in the exhaust system. Youd need to check on how well that is working to get the full performance out of the engine but at least it wouldnt potentially bust up a piston.  ampnbsp  Thats about all I know. ,2Strokes,d43bznd,2,t5_37jzf
