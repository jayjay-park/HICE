6120396,0,t3_3yw4yt,Yeah Ill be frank I find the Skytemple stage too hard.The issue is that the stage very often confines you to a narrow position due to the platforms on which you have to wait but all the enemies counteract that either taking up loads of horizontal the punchy guys or vertical the firepillar guys real estate. The lasers are brutal because getting hit is almost guaranteed to make you fall down dealing  damage in total and forcing you to redo an often fairly large section due to there being many moving platforms and little solid ground. I also find the bats to be particularly infuriating in this level since the geysir platforms often catapult you right into them. Dodging them is also made really difficult because you can barely move left and right on all the small platforms. Not to mention the very real possibility of accidentally falling down onto a solid platform forcing you to redo a huge part.Yes I get that all that except maybe the last part is the entire point of the level and that its supposed to be difficult but I feel that its rather a bit much.I also think that enemies should deaggro if youre out of range for a while because being hit by fire pillars out of nowhere is kinda dumb but thats more of a general thing.,20xxgame,cylbqhw,2,t5_33ug3
6660892,0,t3_46ezyl,No Damage rooms give you two seconds in between waves and during one of them you can see where the enemies are spawning. This doesnt help if you hit a super lategame one where they just spawn everywhere so we still have work to do here.Think Ive fixed the thing where challenge rooms were spawning guys early? Well see!Zooms going away. see my post below the other commenters here do a good job of explaining whyNo were probably not doing a minimap. Weve experimented with this and actually have the tech in game just doesnt feel like the right fitProbably no storychoose your full stage order by .  just not a critical feature on our list! Might be a postrelease feature.,20xxgame,d08akoo,2,t5_33ug3
8079420,0,t1_d4o6stf,Ok so I was trying to play another game I got in the steam sale and noticed something odd.  My PC was claiming I had a  controller plugged in when I dont.  Try opening your Devices amp Printers window and remove any  controllers listed.  This was preventing the other game from working as it was trying to use the first controller it found which was the phantom  controller.,20xxgame,d4o7adh,1,t5_33ug3
8137486,0,t3_4qmlm9,Ahh yes. Wall cling to the side of that post dash jump to the left when the platform is down grab a quick wall dash jump off the side to get further left OR use that jump to head right and plan to wall jump again. ,20xxgame,d4uqbrv,1,t5_33ug3
8195251,0,t1_d50nidy,Yeah I agree. Not that being hard is a bad thing but the one where level generation starts at  is so difficult that you either have to have a big bank of Soul chips and a good selection of augments at the Arc ship or you have to be pretty lucky with Glory rooms and Augments in game. Being able to start with Armor would make it pretty fun and wouldnt make you have to either get incredibly lucky or play endless mode.My friend and I have been doing marathonhigher difficulty with very few soul chips recently and its extremely hard and fun. ,20xxgame,d51yiis,1,t5_33ug3
8327333,0,t1_d5h2fdq,I think youd be surprised.Force nova and Flame shield are bread and butter in hardcore runs as well as difficult skull runs. They removenegate projectiles which can be the difference between winning and losing on certain bosses.If youre liking the game and have already beat it on normal I would suggest trying it out on Marathon to see how that plays for you!,20xxgame,d5igzhn,1,t5_33ug3
8358681,0,t1_d5cmtln,So whats the best way for us to implement something like this? We can give players the ability to launch the game with a specific seed which could then be shared w other players  should we tie a seedseed entry to a list of Skulls too or make all that optional?,20xxgame,d5mdy1d,1,t5_33ug3
8479698,0,t3_4vubcr,There is the Glaive weapon which has the spinning slash from the MMZ games. ,20xxgame,d61i7b6,1,t5_33ug3
8584015,0,t3_4xcgb7,Definitely not possible yet  maybe after .! Just not time to implement that sort of thing yet.,20xxgame,d6el6qs,2,t5_33ug3
8604421,0,t3_4x691w,We should be friends Im doing LibGDX things and Id be more than happy to help D,20xxgame,d6h5avf,1,t5_33ug3
8709732,0,t3_4z94h4,Im going to have to support your Agrisort argument mainly for the long horizontal sections with the flame spouts that run in sequence with conveyors with blue flame hazards and the long vertical sections with spammy drones and moving platforms. Both those sections become a straight dboosting gauntlet to get past since I would otherwise take more damage trying to be cautious with it.,20xxgame,d6ucpfg,1,t5_33ug3
8964750,0,t3_5302en,Oh man super miserable. Ive identified whats causing this  definitely a bug  and fixed it for next patch.edit for the curious the what should my max HP be? function is also where the mods for stuff like Undying and Endless come in  and they were being reapplied for the split rollsters.,20xxgame,d7pff1u,5,t5_33ug3
9190656,0,t3_565pyi,Hey! Were redoing pause screen stuff kinda soon so well see if we still have an issue after that.To your main point  jumping up during the postmagceilleeway wasnt originally intended but at least for now weve decided to leave it in. Folks enjoy it and its not super broken.,20xxgame,d8gzefa,2,t5_33ug3
10458996,0,t1_dcst9r2,Hotfixed.,20xxgame,dctmsem,1,t5_33ug3
10669728,0,t3_5rwdtm,Yup! Barring some unforeseen catastrophe well be there! Be sure to stop by and say hello! ,20xxgame,ddgi2gx,2,t5_33ug3
10779002,0,t3_5rydj5,I thought jump height was patched. The amount you get per point of jump height was reduced although in such a way that didnt alter how Plumbers Hat works at all. Plumbers Hat gives the same amount of jump height now as it always has Im pretty sure jump height does have diminishing returns every ? jump height though!I do feel like there should be a way to reduce your jump height though like there is a way to reduce your speed.Also Leafmetal isnt new just sayin V It was a Prototype Aug for a long time but it was so underwhelming that the devs just made it a regular Aug.,20xxgame,ddrrxw3,1,t5_33ug3
10791354,0,t3_5svq0c,I like it the way it is but another feature thought Could make  of the boss powers stay menuchanged only and make like the one on Y change with a quick change thing or something and still maintain  buttons but do more. Not sure how theyd shoehorn that onto a control though I use a steam controller so I rarely am really out of buttons lol,20xxgame,ddt1vpm,1,t5_33ug3
10916539,0,t1_de5wgnz,Yeah totally. Still needs to be fixed though!,20xxgame,de5ypj5,1,t5_33ug3
