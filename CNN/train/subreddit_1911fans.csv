5221311,0,t1_cveusvp,Personally if were not talking strictly longrange Im a leveraction man myself. But Im also the kind of guy that conceal carries a single action revolver under his blazer and puts serious thought into buying a stoeger double defense sidebyside. So i may be a touched biased.,1911fans,cvfcynp,1,t5_3a0xc
5387052,0,t1_cw08xcn,i plan to custom order either. Looking at a commander length slide. just feel like having something a little shorter.,1911fans,cw098k2,1,t5_3a0xc
5484978,0,t3_3q77dy,Finally! Great review!I share your sentiment that the Operator is too close to Baer territory for me to think its worth it. However the standard TRP is definitely a great buy if youre looking for something a little nicer than a standard Colt. The one thing that gets me is the glued ejector. Ive read about a lot of them coming loose around  rounds so Im really interested in seeing how yours fares. One thing I am pretty sure of is that Springfield will fix it for free and if you ask they will even fix it the right way and pin it for no extra cost. ,1911fans,cwcr9d1,1,t5_3a0xc
5486176,0,t1_cwcwnfl,Is this your firstonly ? If it is especially if you dont think youll use the rail Id go with the TRP. ,1911fans,cwcwri8,1,t5_3a0xc

6776570,0,t3_48kszp,Ive found I prefer arched MSHs but unfortunately most new s come with flat ones. Uoldsguy gave me a rundown of aftermarket arched MSHs and I ended up going with an Ed Brown. This is my first instance of tinkering with a  and it was pretty fun. The quality is much better and the fit both to the gun and in my hand is perfect! ,1911fans,d0keozf,2,t5_3a0xc

7289339,0,t1_d26kx4y,gt Man Im a computer engineer whos suffered through many EE classes and labs and that amplifier is over my head. That looks awesome and super well done. Thats really cool.I have a friend of  years whos an EE.  He was convinced I would fail kill myself or both making the amp.  I asked him for advice during the build but he had little to give.  He said it was like asking a modern ME about steam enginesits an obsolete technology thats no longer taught.Tubes are high voltage like  sometimes much more and low current the exact opposite of SS.  They are deadly.   mA at v is enough to stop your heart.,1911fans,d26qysv,3,t5_3a0xc
7295206,0,t1_d238zbc,If your mags are anything like the mags that came with my Wiley Clapp theyll smooth out and become actually decently reliable after about  rounds.,1911fans,d27eyqk,1,t5_3a0xc

7380942,0,t1_d2h4y87,I need to get more trigger time with base model guns first. Definitely dehorned black nitride finish spur hammer polished internal components Novak sights maybe checkering on the top of slide. ,1911fans,d2h5v7g,2,t5_3a0xc
7698077,0,t1_d3h7s99,Nice. Ill order one and try to adjust my current one. Wouldnt hurt to have a spare in case I bugger this one up. Heh.Thanks for all the help. Im sure Ill need more after I put another  rounds through it. ,1911fans,d3h7z4f,2,t5_3a0xc
7740102,0,t1_d3lz576,Yep. My dreams of an Alchemy Monolith are crushed. Check out Evolution Armory. He used to work at Colt Custom Shop and you can see his work on his FB page. ,1911fans,d3lzs0r,2,t5_3a0xc
8122292,0,t1_d4ryy9f,Ok back from the range. After the first test I hit the inside of the bushing again and improved the slight hitch out had going over the muzzle.Accuracy was only slightly improved but not enough to say is fixed. Shots all land to the right and were stringing up and down instead of a big smiley face. Primers were all struck pretty much dead centre using my mk eyeballI took it apart to measure and see if I had the recommended . clearance and it appears that I do but what I also have after  rounds today is a broken slide releasebarrel link pin... now Im pushing k rounds through this norinco at this point but I have to assume the fit of the new bushing is what caused it.Any pointers here? Im at a loss and dont want to just give up on it and go back to stock... I envy you guys down south with  smiths to go to.Edit I also dont want to just replace the broken part without solving what caused it to break. Edit  was having failure to feeds again after a couple mags but dont know when that pin broke...,1911fans,d4t0odn,1,t5_3a0xc

9978353,0,t1_db86yuq,I dont know why I waited so long to pull the trigger on one.  Its so much fun and such a great shooter. I thought about a Colt SAA but didnt want to pay that much for one and I also like that the Rugers are bomb proof.,1911fans,db87h8g,2,t5_3a0xc

10444623,0,t1_dcryj3m,It feels lighter than the dual spring. Not by a lot though. I have shot  rounds since putting it in the gun and it worked flawlessly. I think it feels pretty comparable to the . pound spring in my Baer.,1911fans,dcrzcov,3,t5_3a0xc
10696185,0,t3_5t0ole,I shot the Colt SCRG and the HK USP  Tactical with Octane  last night. I admit that this time I did very little structured practice and was mostly just blasting away... but it was pretty fun nonetheless.  rounds for the Colt putting the grand total at  rounds.  rounds for the USP which brings the total to a laughable  rounds! Both guns shot great as usual. Really am a big fan of the USP...Im shooting my first USPSA match on Saturday assuming nothing comes up... so that should be fun. Going to use the Baer again. I will hopefully get video again Im not sure if Ill have anyone there to record but either way Ill report back with how it goes!Also this morning I ordered a case of mm target ammo and a box of gr P Federal HSTs... I currently dont own anything in mm... What could that ammo be for?? Only hint is that it shockingly isnt a  or  or any ish gun! So stay tuned for a couple weeks on that as I continue to acquire ammomagsholster in anticipation...And most importantly get out and SHOOT!,1911fans,ddj8cve,3,t5_3a0xc

11022293,0,t1_dehcb70,Thats what I was thinking. I tried for about  minutes to make my Ruger do it and it wont. I emailed Springfield asking them what they thought about it I am still waiting on a response. I may try to strip it if they take a while to get back to me. Their warranty page has me a little nervous to try anything more than a normal tear down and clean. ,1911fans,dehchr7,3,t5_3a0xc
11791724,0,t3_682dmr,They look cool but their guns arent worth the money. Better to go to a full custom shop for the price.,1911fans,dgwmr1e,2,t5_3a0xc
