11005322,0,t3_5x5dbk,I have a   PSA midweight barrel made by FN... SpcII  in  twist.  I absolutely love it.  It is perfect for long hikes and very accurate.  It is cold hammer forged so I do not notice a shift in accuracy when the barrel is hot.  It is one of the most accurate AR barrels I own.     Magazines can be tricky Ive had the best luck with PRI and ACS.   If the front end feels light just add a grip or try using a BCM stock or other light weight stock.,68SPC,deff7d6,1,t5_2wbdu
