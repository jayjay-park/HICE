2555505,0,t3_2p07ve,When you change your eating habits your body will adjust to it... even after sticking with it just for a few days you will notice that your body automatically demands less food. Cutting down on sugar especially helps  when youve been eating sugar your body craves it more. When you go without it your body doesnt know its missing it. Drinking a lot of water helps too  a lot of the time we eat when were thirsty because our brain doesnt differentiate it for us.When I cut down how much Im eating the first two or three days are easy the following few days after that get a little more difficult but then my body totally adjusts and I completely forget about eating a lot of the time. You could cut a hundred calories or so everyday until you get down to   that way would be easier to adjust too and you could resist binging.Protein keeps you full so make sure you get a lot of it and make sure not to go overboard on carbs  they can add up really fast. Dont buy snacks unless you really believe you can avoid temptation. I cant so the only snacks I ever buy are beef jerky and pepperoni and berries.IMHO its better to just educate yourself about nutrition and never buy food at the grocery store without reading the nutrition labels first. I cant tell you how many times Ive craved ice cream gone to the grocery store read the nutrition label for every ice cream and put them back in disgust. I still havent had any.

I get all of my caffeine from coffee and its a fantastic hunger suppressant and it boosts my workouts. One thing I would suggest is load up on veggies. You can literally eat a huge salad in an enormous bowl for very few calories. Become familiar with the value of different low calorie dressings and dips.On a regular day I would have the followingBreakfasttwo cups of coffee with two tablespoons of half and half   caloriesthree large eggs scrambled   cup spinach   calories tablespoon salsa   calories tablespoon shredded cheddar cheese   calories teaspoon butter   caloriesTotal calories   caloriesCoat pan with butter over low heat. Once butter is melted toss in spinach and wilt. While spinach is cooking scramble eggs and season as desired salt pepper.

Shred chicken once completely cooked about  minutes  this step can be done the night before. I suggest poaching a lot of chicken at once so you can have extra throughout the week. Toast bagel thin and spread Dijon mustard thinly on both sides. Put chicken romaine lettuce and tomato on bagel thin and cut in half. This is your bagel sandwich. Eat with a side of celery and hummus.MidAfternoon SnackGrande unsweeted iced coffee from Starbucks or make your own   caloriesDinner sweet potato   calories oz ground beef  fat   calories cups romaine lettuce   calories medium carrot   calories cherry tomatoes   calories tablespoons green onions   calories tablespoon honey mustard Kraft brand   caloriesTotal calories  Chop romaine lettuce carrots green onion and cherry tomatoes to your preferred consistency.

Bake the sweet potato and season as preferred suggestion if you like sweet potatoes to be sweet coat lightly with cinnamon. If you like sweet potatoes to have some heat toss lightly with cayenne. You can create sweet potato fries for a few extra calories by tossing or spraying oil to coat potatoes. You can also cube potato or bake it whole and split it open like a baked potato.

Also now when I do eat snackyjunk foods or even just higher cal foods like cheese which I also love I try to eat the labels serving size.

You can poach the chicken in flavored broth bake the chicken with a bit broth at the bottom to keep it fresh  I go with  for  min and it is always quite moist I recommend you cook chicken with the bones on to get more moist and slow cook chicken. . My favorite spice mix are paprika salt garlic onion powder and pepper. My favorite meat marinate is white wine Italian herbs hot pepper salt and pepper. Rub mustard on steak it is great. . I dont like avocado so I dont know the answer. . I believe the perfect way to poach an egg is that you boil the water and as the water just start to boil you put in the egg. You turn off the water and let the egg sit in there for  min or so. . Best low calorie cheese would be ricotta cottage low fat mozzarella swiss cheese and cream cheese. . I like to use all kinds of greens broccoli green beans kale bok choy green onions swiss chard leek cabbage green cauliflower brussel sprouts list just goes on. Every week I recommend you for something new. I hope this helps  ,1200isplenty,cv0bcyo,2,t5_2xk5e

5988407,0,t1_cy4lvzt,The classic recipe Ive used has been oil basil parmesan cheese and pine nuts. She mentioned wanting to not use oil in her original post which is why I suggested keeping the pine nuts and cheese which both add a lot of that nutty pesto flavor in my opinion but instead cutting the oil.. the oil thins it outadds that liquid element that allows the sauce to be thinner and blend up so I suggested a tiny bit of water or lemon juice to help thin. Was just a suggestion she doesnt have to follow it if she doesnt want to. I guess I viewed it similarly to some of the suggestions around hummus. A lot of hummus recipes have oil in them however you can use some of the liquid from the canned chickepeas instead of oil and still get a decent hummus. Or alternatively she can look at the pinterest recipes I suggested some of them sub in other sources of fat like avocado. ,1200isplenty,cy4m0s9,6,t5_2xk5e

6043503,0,t3_3yabhs,Hello! Firstly congrats on a new life changing machine. Fresh pasta is a taste like no other. Ive experimented around with mine a bit and below is the best version Ive found that works for me. To note I have tried half steamed cauliflower and half flour instead of only flour but youre reallyyy sacrificing taste on that one. Fresh pasta is so FLIPPING tasty that I think even the smaller volume is satisfying much more than an equivalent amount of store bought. If you need to bulk it up add zoodles or tons of veggies to your new homemade pasta.  cup flour  egg white or equivalent egg in a carton a la Egg Beaters  top salt  tbsp water youll be eyeballing how much water you add true Italian style. These are the ratios for one person. Just multiply for more people. Mix the flour and salt. Make a little space in the middle of the dry mix and drop your egg white in there. Slowly start beating the egg white and add little bits of flour. It should start to look like a dough but add some little bits of water if it is dry. You dont want it too stickywet however. If its sticking to your hands from the wetness add a sprinkle of flour till it is properly dough like. Now flour a surface and knead that shit till kingdom come. Once you think youre done knead for  more minutes. Break a chunk off and work through the maker. Voila! Let the good times roll see what I did there in your new pasta maker! Post pics and hope the info helped  sorry for the essay and crap formatting ,1200isplenty,cybt85f,59,t5_2xk5e

If you make most of your food however as a lot of people watching calories end up doing your sodium intake is likely a fraction of your peers who arent even with the pickles. Edit oh!

But on the days you cant there is discipline. Motivationtheres actually  different types. Positive motivation is the common one. Do the thing and your life will improve!. Great but when you are sad and hopeless then this doesnt work. The opposite is negative motivation. Do the thing or your life will suck more. Go to work or you will be fired. Dont buy a new cellphone or you cant afford rent. The nice thing about negative motivation is the worse you feel the more you can believe bad things can happen. Its kinda fucked up but I want that brownie... but I cant eat it or I will get fatter and more unhappy and further away from my goal is damn effective. So put it in your toolbox. Discipline You dont have to want to do it. You just have to do it. Thats the difference between motivation and discipline. Motivation is emotionbased. Discipline is thoughtbased. You can say ugh I am cranky and tired and sick of this! Its important to aknowledge what signals your chemicals are sending you. But those emotional reactions are temporary and they can trick you  if your gut bacteria is used to a high fat diet when you cut back your flora sends signals saying omg cheese! You waaaaant it. You can have it. You did so good the past week now its time for cheese and you think just because you feel that way then it must be true. Nope. Emotion is less important than your logical thought and logically you have no good reason to break the diet. So you dont. You might growl and stomp but you hold discipline because you committed to the thing and you will do it with a stiff upper lip. And each time you do it it gets easier. ,1200isplenty,d029qww,3,t5_2xk5e

Edit the thing I like most about logging until bed is it lets me see patterns. For example when I grab a pastry at the office in the morning even if I only eat half Im more likely to binge eat or at least have a very hard time sticking to goal. I can also see I dont have that issue if I eat sugar at night. So that tells me I should try to avoid sugar until later in the day when my meals are finished but that I dont need to avoid it all together.

If I cant then this is just a diet and not a lifestyle change. And if its a diet then its unsustainable and this is pointless. We need to be able to enjoy ourselves with friends and family during special occasions without the fear of our own personal guilt and self inflicted consequences getting in the way. Just get back on track. Go right back to  a day. Dont exercise more if that will make you miserable. Dont cut your calories down to  a day for the next two weeks in hopes that that will maybe possibly negate the extra  you ate. Believe me I know its tempting to set one but there is no deadline for healthy weight loss and overall health.

Ive never had kids but it seems relatable to the way some pregnant women become averse to certain foods and smells.I dont expect to get medical advice from this sub I just need some suggestions of foods because I literally cant think of anything. Its weird but every time I try to think of food I can eat my brain just sort of glosses over a handful of things I eat regularly and none of them seem appealing and I get that sort of nauseated feeling and my mouth feels gross. Its hard to explain.But then Ill be walking by a bakery and smell a donut I rarely ever eat donuts and announce to my boyfriend we need to buy them immediately and I ate  over the course of the next  hours.All of the things that I listed that Ive been eating lately are things I almost never eat.

The downside is if I dont eat breakfast by the time lunch time comes around at work Im ready to flip out and devour everything. So I eat a snack for breakfast take my lunch light meal another snack and then I have sometimes around  calories left for dinner. I eat my normal healthy food but in larger portions and its more satisfying.Then about once a week I let myself eat a large quantity of unhealthy food like half a pizza or chinese takeout or food truck tacos or whatever Ive spent most of my week thinking about but not too much to set back my weight loss a lot. I know its still detrimental to eat  calories once a week Im slowing my weight loss but its for my own sanity or Ill lose my mind and spin out of control. I should note that Im still currently unable to tolerate  a day Im at  but next grocery trip Im getting some lower calorie variants of food I eat frequently like mayo sliced cheese almond milk so I can make an effort again but Im  and lbs so perhaps  is just not sustainable for me at this weight,1200isplenty,dbs1wlx,2,t5_2xk5e

A gram of fat has  calories a gram of carbs has  calories and a gram of protein has  calories.  Every food label for any food item just uses that to calculate the calories.  In reality there are some foods our bodies process easily and some that take considerable energy to process.  It takes more calories to digest raw foods than cooked meat than vegetables whole grain bread than white bread etc.  Theres a lot of interesting research now where scientists are actually measuring the amount of calories we poop out and with some foods its quite a bit  somewhere around  of the calories in whole almonds for example.,1200isplenty,de3bl7i,34,t5_2xk5e

I set everything up the night before so Im ready to go first thing. If you dont want to sleep in them try picking them out the night before and changing into them as soon as you wake. To answer the OP exercise helps so much for my depression and anxiety. Helps a bit with my ADHD and sleep too. On top of that I feel better when I eat a high protein low carb diet so I stick to it with the occasional treat. Sugar is horrible for my mood and affects me in other ways...Im reminded every time I have a sugary dessert or something. Also when Im exercising regularly I find I have more self discipline to stick to a decent diet. I suppose my body is releasing endorphins and such so I dont crave feel good foods as much. Weightlifting x a week and daily cardio just enough to get my heart rate up a bit has changed my life.

11572955,0,t3_655zjc,We are having ALL the calories. Scalloped potatoes ham homemade rolls green beans asparagus and maple glazed carrots. Holidays are a big exception to my diet but I have been trimming to  calories a day this week to prepare for it. This way when I jump on the scale Monday I am only a day behind where I would normally be. I probably will skip the chocolate bunny though. Happy Easter!!!,1200isplenty,dg7stus,16,t5_2xk5e

11578133,0,t1_dg6javb,For some reason they seem to need a bit of time to settle for me. Like I could probably sit and eat most nuts like snack food for a fairly long time. Well after the normal  calorie pack I usually prepare. But if I just eat that  calories worth and wait a while I notice my hunger fading down fairly quickly. The portability and unprocessed nature of them is the biggest thing to me. Though Ill concede that thinking about it I could see how they might not be the best fit for what most people are looking for. ,1200isplenty,dg8dyr6,1,t5_2xk5e

Its disheartening at times for me to have the smaller plate but both of us being on the same journey trying to get healthy has helped tremendously.

I was  pounds at . He had just been diagnosed with dangerous high blood pressure type  diabetes and was put on multiple medications. I knew that realistically I probably wasnt too far behind. Id already lost a few pounds doing CICO but we decided to commit to lifelong changes together because wed like to grow old together and stay as healthy as we can for as long as we can and we both have long standing food habits that are destructive.Hes down to  pounds and Im down to . He was just taken off his diabetes mediation and his blood pressure medication was cut in half. Were not to health weights yet obviously but were supporting each other and learning healthy habits together.Now if we can just find the motivation and time to put a little exercise into our lives wed be much better off.,1200isplenty,dgq1fyf,14,t5_2xk5e
