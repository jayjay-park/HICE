Trying to pretend that anything I do has value.I work out solely so that I will look less like a disgusting tranny when I cosplay in March. I learn makeup so that maybe I can be cute enough to be noticed by those I want to notice me. I do everything I can not for myself but for how others can see me.The only good thing is that when I am sad my drawings come out slightly better. Not much better really but just a little.

If youre full time in the US thats  more hours youre working per week every week. Whats that for?If youre spending  hours a week focusing on food which is an incredibly pessimistic estimate of ancient societies youre still working less than any modern person with a livable wage. You dont need to pay bills there are no taxes. Shelters are either family dwellings you were born into or low maintenance temporary places that could be replaced in hours and theres probably an easy source of water.So yeah they might work more for food. They still work less than you on the whole which is a much more important piece of information.,2meirl4meirl,dc9lzap,1,t5_3ee85

10300672,0,t3_5ncoln,Damn this is the story of my life. I had such a promising future ahead of me. I had a violent and troublesome childhood growing up in the ghetto but I turned my life around and was getting straight As in college started following my dreams of being a professional dancer was part of student govt had multiple part time jobs was creating my own shows and honing my other talents in writing music etc. I was excelling at a very rapid rate both in dance and academics. I started late but got good really fast. I had tons of people that wanted to work with me. I had tons of girls tons of friends and life was great.  Then my brain just started malfunctioning. I didnt believe in medication after seeing my Mom abuse them so I took up counseling but it didnt help much. I tried to take yoga and meditation more seriously. But it wasnt enough.  Id randomly go into purely manic states where my mind would race out of control. I wasnt able to rationalize my thoughts so I ended up behaving very irrationally. Id have extremely out of control emotional responses to even the smallest triggers. Id be up for  days straight crash go into deep depression then go into violent rage.  After a few years passed the symptoms just kept getting worse. I picked up a weed habit because it was the only thing that calmed me down but the habit went out of control to the point I couldnt function normally unless I was high. I was smoking ths every  days. I had destroyed many of my friendships ruined opportunities destroyed my body and destroyed my dreams.  Now Im finally on medication. My mental state is a lot better but my life is already ruined. I cant dance anymore my body is ruined I dont have any friends I spend all my time alone in my room I completely fucked up my college career I cant hold a job or get one that pays me enough to move out my moms house. No one wants to be friends with someone that has an inconsistent personality. And I just generally have a bad attitude towards life and relationships because of the shit Ive been through.    Every day I have to fight off the suicidal urges. Im sort of just waiting for my Mom to die so I can kill myself. I just wish I started taking medication when I was younger BEFORE I completely ruined my life.  ,2meirl4meirl,dcbmxt4,6,t5_3ee85

10400156,0,t3_5oxla7,Honestly this week has been one of the worst for me. Im part of the theater in my high school and were putting on a play with student directors that are just awful. The directors expect so much me and three other techies people who actually do shit like move prop curtains switch lights on and off and cue sound effects. Because of being a techie Im stressed all the fucking time going so far having stress dreams about shit going wrong. Another awful thing that happened was that my friend was like Hey come to the dance and have fun with your friends! I went because hey its a reason to get out of the house for once. It was boring as hell because of all my friends decided to ignore Me so I ended up just drinking a shit ton of soda. One more is I was talking to someone but now they just blow me off anytime I try talking to her. All in all Im surprised I havent killed my self yet,2meirl4meirl,dcmxac8,6,t5_3ee85

We need to be challenged we need to overcome conflict to feel fulfilled and our society is more and more focused on settling in and being comfortable with some of the core aspects of survival namely food and shelter completely trivialized. Maybe some people can find enjoyment in that security of survival but it should come as no surprise that many of us cannot....I mean me too thanks.,2meirl4meirl,dd56lin,9,t5_3ee85

What would you have done differently? Your parents are still humans flaws and all capable of the entire range of human emotion. Just because they chose to try to be happy and not place their burdens on you doesnt mean they were being fake. They were being good parents.

If they used something too big it might just pancake Earth.

11346712,0,t1_dfi2pbp,Well he had some random heart problems a few years ago that didnt allow him to work. He got the ok from his doctor to work some time before baby was born but he didnt find a job he wanted. So he didnt really try too hard to find one but if he had we wouldve both been working. So he kinda didnt really mind staying home then he does now. Dang well see thats a lot more baby practice than I ever had. I remember I tried to hold my cousins baby a couple years ago and I was having some serious issues. This kid could have been  oz and I still wouldnt have been able to hold him. I audibly awwd at that call me dad. Thats crazy I cant even begin to imagine what itd be like to be in that position. Id feel like I couldnt do anything about it. My husbands grandfather has PTSD also. For the longest time he didnt wanna go to see a doctor because he didnt like talking about what caused his PTSD Vietnam. Hes finally gone now and he seems to be doing better. He didnt like that they made him take medication though. Says it makes him feel like a zombie. Right? I think another thing about it is that maybe they think Im overreacting. My dad has or at least had when I was with them havent lived with them since I was  real bad anger problems. Mom dealt with anxiety a lot. I think since theyre alive and well they think theyre as good as they could be so I can make it too. And Im sure I could but it definitely can be better. Id rather not take out my anger on innocent people andor hurt my kids because I cant control myself like my dad or be scared of everything and just succumb to whatever shitty situation I get in like my mom. Ah but theyre old and stubborn. They mean well at least. Speaking of which I remember during the night they were supposed to announce who won this last election one of my female coworkers was saying that she didnt really like Trump but that she hoped that he won because having a woman as a president would be horrible since shed get emotional for no reason and start wars. I was like what. This lady has two daughters lmao the poor things. Ugh same. If i happen to get bored of regular front page things Ill go into rDIY or rwoodworking and pretend Ill do a project like the ones on those subs some day. Im pretty sure my life right now is work baby until baby bed time Reddit. And sometimes Ill browse eBay for nothing in particular because I have no self control. I actually kinda doubt he felt the same because he even brought his two year old daughter with him  man dat feel is coming back. Aw but she thought you had a nice butt probably! And also dang that just sounds uncomfortable that whole situation with the secret admirer. I had something similar but the dude was a bit more open with his uh admiration. And the thing about it was that I wasnt interested to begin with but thought it was kinda cute. Still I made sure to let him know I wasnt interested. But he kept insisting to the point itd get really annoying so I would just go off on him and be real freaking mean so hed get pissed and try to make me jealous or just flat out ignored me. I felt bad and I apologized for being so mean and I guess he took it as a go ahead for his advances so hed get clingy all over again Id get annoyed and be mean hed get mad... that went on for an embarrassingly long time. I wasnt even into anyone else. Eventually he said to me that he was moving away soon and asked if I wanted to go out before he did. I declined again and he finally stopped. This kid wasnt the best looking dude and he was a bit awkward. Not as awkward as your girl there but still. But damn last year I came across his Facebook and good lawd he got CUTE. And I remembered that back when he was after me I kept telling myself this dude is gonna grow up to be a fucking model and have this real hot gf and this amazing life and youre gonna feel like an asshole. And yeah I did feel like an asshole but only because I rejected him. To my surprise I was actually happy for him but that may have been because I felt like I no longer had to feel guilty? I hope thats not the case. He was a real nice dude. Yeah I think thats it. It sucks that you have to actually think about whether a person is being creepy or not based on looks lol. Like is this b being creepy or do I just think theyre ugly? Im just passively an asshole sometimes. Its just a basic function that doesnt even require energy to perform. Ugh. Yeah! Aw hell there was a list of personality types that was real good I cant remember what its called. One of my psychology professors had us take the personally test and we got our results and it was really accurate to how we are. I think the website was something like personalities.com. Yep thats what it is. Anyway thats what this reminded me of. You being kind of an introvert but also not really. Ooh nice. I finished watching season one of this depressing horseman.
