2472194,0,t3_2nutpn,To this day the members of Supertramp are fighting about how they want their music used in the st century. Their battles are petty and stupid. Thanks uBokonon for being able to find an exceptional version of this song. It is an amazing feat considering lawyers for all parties involved usually demand all videos be taken down.  I love Sumpertramp...their war with each other is ridiculous. ,70smusic,cmh9fsb,2,t5_2v5dk

9938307,0,t3_5hqjnn,I was stationed overseas at Clark AB Philippines when this album came out. Was kind of out of the loop due to the location and era. Saw this album in the PX with a warning label due to the lyrics and read something about them in RS when they still wrote about good music so I bought it on a whim. Turned out to be a perfect album from start to finish but Death or Glory is the crowning achievement in my opinion. I dont think in the ensuing  years I have ever fast forwarded or skipped it whenever it came on radio Sirius or any other media.Absolutely fantastic song.,70smusic,db2zj2t,2,t5_2v5dk
