2358975,0,t3_2mc6wy,Go with the vortex. I used to be one of their industry pros because I worked in the firearms industry. If your equipment breaks even if its your fault they will make it right again. If you break your scope on a hunt not a  fun example mind you and cant wait to get a replacement shipped they have been known to call a local retailer and pay for it so you can just walk on and walk out with it. They have the best customer service,3gun,cm3a31d,3,t5_2uoba

5862506,0,t3_3vj9mv,Im not really an expert but I have competed before. I dont think  is too long but a bull barrel might suck.  But having a decent trigger is the biggest thing for me personally. So if having a longer barrel means skimping on trigger or running iron sights then yes its too long. I shoot a pump gun and I like it so Im probably not qualified to answer the second part of that heh.,3gun,cxo3s1x,3,t5_2uoba

6231300,0,t3_40salm,I see some of the better equiped go with two options for their shotgun shells.  One is for  reloads that has a lot of room on it and then a totally seperate belt for about  full reloads of the shotgun that goes across the entire front of the waist.  I personally am about  matches in and still use a pouch for carrying shotgun shells around make no mistake it is slow and I will often time out on a shotgun only or heavy stage.  Also the match usually post the require round count and course designs from this I try and see about how much and what I will need for ammo.,3gun,cyxximp,2,t5_2uoba
6373050,0,t1_cz7do91,Modified stock plunger is fine  this just gives a lower spring rate. But the spacer tube even if you havent run into issues is cheap insurance in wet weather,3gun,cze1nip,1,t5_2uoba
6435254,0,t3_43u1xs,Yeah extra FPS. Also having a rifle length gas system makes for a smoother recoil impulse and improved dwell time for reliability. combine that with an adjustable gas block and a LW BCG and buffer and you have a pretty smooth runnin riffle.,3gun,czkxywg,3,t5_2uoba
6946486,0,t3_4aqrpr,Nice. Ive fiddled around with kydex and homemade shell caddies for a while but never put enough time into it to come up with a finished product quite that slick. Not yet anyway  that may be in my near future....One thing Ill throw out there is that Ive also had pretty good luck using metal broom clips. Generally mounted on the wall to hold... well brooms and stuff they happen to be just the right size to grab onto a  gauge shell. Near as I can tell theyre exactly what Taccom uses for their entrylevel loadtwo caddies. I went with those over plastic because they dont require any modification to work well and are generally available at most hardware stores but its really a matter of personal preference. Ive run a combination of homemade and commercial caddies that use those clips and havent found any differences in performance between the two. ,3gun,d13pqst,3,t5_2uoba

It is a constant work in progress but has been seeing hard duty for the past  months and has worked very well for me.Just searched d cordura fabric and found the best price per yard.

8395419,0,t1_d5qngde,Youve never shot that comp. OP is right its absolutely from the comp. You should see the hair of my female friend fly back when she touches off a round through her AR with the M attached. Its crazy. ,3gun,d5qz32l,4,t5_2uoba
