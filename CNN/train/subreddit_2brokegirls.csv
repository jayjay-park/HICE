423632,0,t3_1yukmz,this one was pretty funny. im not a fan of oleg but he was used really well in the opening scene. im liking max and deke so far. theyre cute together but not obnoxious. and max has gotten slightly less abrasive since they started dating. i dont understand what caroline sees in nicolas though...,2brokegirls,cfooagv,1,t5_2t0n8
6537539,0,t3_3n63p4,I am just gonna argue for this show I kind of like and say....You can have your opinion but sitcoms do indeed get much shittier and I think the fact that the shows still on is more due to its positive traits more than the public lacking taste.In BG the actors have a decent ensemble dynamic.  Its not like failed pilot trash like Mulaney where there is clearly no ensemble chemistry.   Its no Cheers but we fans of the show want to see what kind of widespread silliness will come about within the diner.The girls go on a variety of misadventures and the pacing of each episode is not very predictable.    Its no bombastic singlecamera masterpiece but there are very few episodes that feel completely uninspired or copypasted like season  of the Simpsons or whatever.None of the characters is completely insufferable like in so many s sitcoms I never really liked as a kid.    Max is trashy and petty but very kind Caroline is whiny and indulgent but tends to go with the flow.   Sure the other characters have their stereotypes and their bad habits but also contribute to resolving the problem of the day and none of them abuse the shit out of the main characters.  I never liked Malcolm in the MiddleEverybody Hates Chris type garbage.  In those kind of shows whenever you have an asshole character being a decent person for once its a very special episode.   In  Broke Girls its par for the course.   Even the various villains they encounter have an endearing quirk that motivates them to for some reason try and screw over the girls and they usually work things out with the antagonist for a jolly good time.If you dont think the endless lewd jokes and fairly cheap puns are good I challenge you to look at the last  reddit posts you thought were funny and tell me if they were any better written than a  Broke Girls joke.  IMO its only because we expect less from forums and more from TV that we actually smile at those semifunny internet oneliners.For me its fan service.   To me Max and Caroline are extremely sexy characters because theyre really comfortable with how sexy they are despite having lots of hilarious hangups.    So to me theyre as waifutier as a singlecamera sitcom character can be.     Except in episodes that are pretty boring..like that Irish boy story arc.   Otherwise the show also has a nice level of comedyromance in it not churning out the relationship drama or boyfriendgirlfriend clichs too much.Not to mention that their friendship is more realistic than in most other silly singlecamera sitcoms.  I mean yeah they tend to forget their mistakes but they have a camaraderie I like to witness.  And theres the whole trying to actually get money type of thing which keeps the story slightly worth following each episode.I really think BG does a lot of things right that other sitcoms suck at.If youre still not convinced BG isnt bottom of the barrel in comedy entertainment you could always look at the panel comics in your local newspaper.,2brokegirls,czvj8x9,2,t5_2t0n8
