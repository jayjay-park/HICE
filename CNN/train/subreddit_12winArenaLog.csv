1200534,0,t3_27onrd,Not bad with this deck. Seems kinda slow? Plus only  flamestrike and no fireball.,12winArenaLog,ci4ofjx,3,t5_32448
1201376,0,t1_ci4rpq2,I will make a rules thread with a rule that specifies format. My plan is a text list of minions and a screenshot that shows the curve will be required. Rewards and Comments would be nice but are not required since the main focus of the sub is the draft.,12winArenaLog,ci4ruaq,1,t5_32448
1875035,0,t3_2fz3bs,No swipes... but  wraths and  starfalls. Plenty removal,12winArenaLog,ckf4v7a,2,t5_32448
3468876,0,t1_cpnnrhe,It was Velens Chosen because of double Amani Berserker and double Lightspawn. Having a  Amani on turn  as priest is pretty much gg. Amani combos well with Lightbomb too. Also the panda was very nice to bounce back my silenced Lightspawns and Shade. ,12winArenaLog,cpnodq5,1,t5_32448

4483637,0,t1_csvqajc,not a single one. wouldnt have picked it bc i think kezan is kinda bad in arena but it was better than my other choices.,12winArenaLog,csvttfo,1,t5_32448
4520699,0,t3_3cyxw1,Good work  write up.  Always glad to see a warrior make a run ,12winArenaLog,ct0h54f,1,t5_32448
4559029,0,t3_3dgews,I like it maybe do both though post the decklist and a video. Also open the pack damn you.,12winArenaLog,ct5a80n,1,t5_32448

6978963,0,t1_d17bky9,The big thing to understand with Hunter is that you dont go face until youre sure you have enough reach to win. So many people I see play Hunter just go face like they would in constructed then fall victim to bad trades and lose. Turn the screw only when you have the board secure.,12winArenaLog,d17ejsj,1,t5_32448
9096413,0,t3_54tbp7,Good job! For Mage Djinni is a  mana . It is not worse than Spiteful Smith for example. You even had some synergy with Polymorph Boar to push extra damage. You could also potentially gain some additional ones through the Spellslinger spells. I am not sure how it interacts with Servant of Yogg Saron spells though.,12winArenaLog,d858qte,1,t5_32448
