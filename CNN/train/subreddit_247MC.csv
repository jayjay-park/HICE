3338213,0,t1_cp8rwig,Yeah ideally I wanted a concentrated town surrounding the spawn then from there as we worked together as tight knit neighbors we would have accumulated community supplies localized in that town. Then from there on slowly people ventured out into the wild.I came in maybe twothree hours after the first load of the seed and everyone had already started their own path. So I just let things play out.I guess I am weighing out exactly where I can fit in. Weather I try to purge my vision with the current design or I go into the frontier and build my own ideal concept. The only drawback is the concentration of manpower.   ,247MC,cp8s5es,1,t5_379o0
