4269344,0,t3_39udqs,Canada? headlight washers Looks like its got the coolant to the throttle bodies rerouted a common mod to make pulling the plenum along with the PCV reroute and EGR delete. Also the harness section along the passenger side has been moved. All common things to declutter the engine bay and make working on the engine easier.  Really Id say decide which youd rather do speed swap LOTS of work or a paint job on the front bumper. I usually only recommend swaps on cars that have become an emotional attachment as theyre usually a lot more work than just finding one that came from the factory that way.,300zx,cs6vf3v,1,t5_2sd1q

5401340,0,t1_cw225n1,Who told you this? How else are you going to clean an injector? You arent going to get in there with good old elbow grease and scrub them.  Solvent based injector cleaners are fine.  There are injection cleaner kits out there that do better than the stuff you dump in the tank.  At the end of the day if you need to pull them to clean  them.  Just replace them.  Because theyre likely too far gone. Again.  How do you know your rough running is related to fuel? What tests did you perform? Have you used a  gas analyzer to see if youre running lean? ,300zx,cw22xax,1,t5_2sd1q

7094619,0,t1_d1kc474,I believe the only real performance difference is the compression of the pistons. I believe the heads are slightly different and of course oil spirter angle but those are rather insignificant differences. I saw a post on one of the Z forums written by somebody who explained why people should use NA blocks for turbo builds. They are far more common and you would have to spend ages finding a clean turbo engine.,300zx,d1kjm4k,1,t5_2sd1q

8037914,0,t3_4pazs4,The rust is the biggest problem. Rear fenders aft of the rear wheel will almost always rot out. Under the tool kit in the hatch area. If the TTops have been leaking check the area where the rear crossmember stay bolts to the car both sides on mine were gone its basically in the corner by where the seatbelt bolts to the car. Pull up the carpet and youll see the boss have to remove the seat to do so. Tin worm is what will ruin you and your Z. The engines and diffs are damn near bulletproof and the trans can hold its own. On stock power itll run for damn near forever. At k my  burns a bit of oil doesnt like going to reverse and is slowly turning into a rust heap. Havent changed the timing belt yet but once the cooling fan and shroud are out of the way it looks fairly straightforward if youre doing just the belt. Forums are plenty. HybridZ is where youll want to look for using anything and everything to mod a Z and is my favorite. ,300zx,d4jjc3a,1,t5_2sd1q

Theres plenty of good resources out there to teach you how to do it yourself check out the sidebar for starters.  When I got mine about  years ago I hadnt done much more than oil changes brake jobs and basic repairsmaintenance.

9031681,0,t3_53z50e,You might get lucky and have it just come off with a little prying try that first.  Ive had some pop right off.I highly recommend these Dremel EZ Locks over the older style cutting wheels that screw into the bit.  Theyre much faster to change because these wheels get eaten through and torn up pretty easily and quickly.  Just get the metal cutting ones and you should be good to go.Edit I also remembered the other reason i like the EZ locks a lot more.  The discs typically die in  ways  They just get worn all the way down rare  The outside breaks off  On the old style They break at the center mounting point.  The EZ lock has a wider diameter at the mounting point for the EZ mount and its more reinforced making it much rarer that they break the rd way.  ,300zx,d7xgr6r,3,t5_2sd1q
9190132,0,t3_563x0t,You absolutely have plenty of time to complete the job.  Besides following the guide to line up the marks etc the best thing you do to check and avoid headaches is to count the teeth on the belt between the those marks  While the belt is marked things usually dont line up perfect and its quick insurance to avoid headaches later.  I mention because I thought I had nailed it and ended up  tooth off at the crank which is probably the hardest one to see the marks lining up on.    Certainly you could turn the engine at the crank with a mm socket before starting if you wanted to be extra careful.Check this similar post out from the other day   .Do it yourself you have plenty of time it will be fun to learn.,300zx,d8gx0ao,1,t5_2sd1q
