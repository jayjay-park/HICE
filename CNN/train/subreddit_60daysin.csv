7379428,0,t3_4gev72,Totally agree that the shouldnt be treated like a criminal remark seemed a bit naive.  I also think he was reading into the search a bit much when he insinuated that he was searched differently due to his race.  IMO it definitely seemed like he just got searched a little more thoroughly than the guys on either side of him because he was the only one wearing one of those orange jump suits.  The jump suit is baggier and would be much easier to conceal something in so of course he gets a longer pat down. Seems to me like he and Zach are both just stressed the fuck out and this is an easy outlet for their frustrations an outlet that wont beat their ass while they sleep.  ,60daysin,d2gznhd,6,t5_3d4r8

7512131,0,t1_d2vzz99,The premise was believable in the beginning but youre right how the hell would sending in some of these people effectively do anything? Maybe only the cop and the marine would have the training or experience necessary to be a real mole... But for what? They have no real directives here. The best part is that its painfully obvious what needs improvement... They need to treat them like human beings with brains and personalities and needs. They need to treat those with mental illnesses instead of dropping them in Gen pop and hoping they take their meds. They need windows for daylight and activities and daily routines. They need clean space for everyone to sleep and feel secure. Neglect and degradation arent difficult things to avoid. If the environment were better youd see a decrease in every problem behavior that does nothing but waste everyones time and create institutionalized career felons out of the prisoners. ,60daysin,d2w3bjg,12,t5_3d4r8
7521134,0,t1_d2x1xz4,Yeah that was weird. Its not like it was exceptionally brutal. I could only guess they wouldnt show it for Jeffs dignity....but then they had him flailing around anyway....so yeah weird.,60daysin,d2x46vh,2,t5_3d4r8

8972103,0,t1_d7qa48e,All I saw was editing. The editing is very obvious on this show. He didnt stutter once no freezing it looked like he was in a conversation where they only showed him to look a certain way and only used the shower shoes part like they made it look like Sheri was going to fight and it never happened at all. Editing. You bought it.,60daysin,d7qb7jl,-1,t5_3d4r8

She is now officially a jailhouse snitch and you know other people saw her do it.Well at least I didnt miss the Brian and Daffron fight because it apparently never happened.  Coincidental though that he got booted within a couple days after Brian throw in the towel.,60daysin,d89jxr1,1,t5_3d4r8
9202769,0,t1_d8ifsky,And realistically would any of us have even given it a second thought if they hadnt shown her putting something in the cup and then the camera panning back and forth between the hoodrats upstairs and the cup down on the table?

9273217,0,t1_d8r7tsn,You gotta understand... Most of them really and truly DONT give a shit. To them its just a job and the inmates arent people. They are just rats in a cage. I was in jail for a few days in KY and was supposed to get out at noon on..like a Monday or something Several years ago dont remember exactly.. So obviously when noon came around I was standing there staring at the clock ready to leave. Noon.... nothing... ...nothing... pm.. nothing.. I walk up to the window and flag down a guard tell him I was supposed to get out at noon today. I surrendered myself for a  day sentence and today is it. He just walked away without saying anything. pm.. pm.. Flag down another guard he tells me he doesnt care.. pm..Finally at like  my name gets called. My cousin picks me up and we go to my Aunts house.. She proceeds to tell me that she called them several times to ask what the fuck was going on. Finally someone told her We dont have anyone scheduled to leave today. She said Uhm YES YOU DO. My nephew is getting out today. She finally convinced them to actually fucking look into it. Turns out no one bothered to look at the paperwork and if she hadnt called they wouldve just left me in there for who knows how long. TLDR Most COs genuinely do not care.,60daysin,d8rg3et,12,t5_3d4r8

9511456,0,t1_d8t99oe,Late to the party here but what makes it even worse is that many in jail are awaiting trial and havent yet been convicted... just lack the resources to get out on bail.  So even if you think guilty people should be punished harshly these people are innocent until proven guilty.,60daysin,d9lhm24,1,t5_3d4r8
