Id say the cats not included in that but he is an obligate carnivore...  Ive not intentionally cheated since starting but Ive kicked myself out of ketosis twice thanks to some sickeningly sweet flavored vodka lookin at you Smirnoff CinnaSugar. Talk about keto hangovers haha! Ive been dreading the holidays though Ive been good so far through Halloween. It will be good to have some extra accountability during the winter season. Ive been collecting recipes for keto versions of my favorite holiday treats which Im hoping to share once Ive testedperfected them.e Im also active on MFP and my foodexercise diary is open to friends.

I know begging probably isnt necessary but I really do feel like a jerk having fallen off the wagon so completely.

2569788,0,t3_2p6nzw,My holiday weaknesses are sweets and over indulging in everything. I have been very strict with my diet since I started keto. I have not cheated and dont plan on cheating for Christmas. I may blow my calories for the day with meats but that is all I anticipate. The thing is I seem to have lost all craving for carb rich items. I think about it sometimes maybe eating some cookies when I meet my goals but there is no desire there. Almost just seems like I would do it because I can instead of me wanting to eat it if that makes sense. My husband brags about how I was such a foodie and now I have zero trouble abstaining. Yesterday I was filling a stocking for him that is chock full of some of my favorites and was not tempted to eat a single butterfinger bell or reeses tree. They didnt even register that they were something I could eat as in them physically being food for me put in my mouth not saying they are keto lol. I brought him a few of the ones that wouldnt fit in his stocking and he asked if I was tempted. That was when I realized that these brightly colored foil things in my hand were pieces of food that I had enjoyed in excess a scant  something days ago. Instead of thinking about what I will do after I reach my goals I am just going to focus on my success and how well I feel though I am a bit bummed that the weight loss hasnt helped with my back pain any. However I have panic disorder and it is kind of amazing that things that would have normally caused me anxiety are barely registering on the anxiety meter. I am not sure if this has anything to do with the diet or just that I am happy I am losing weight and in a better mood.Oh and the goals we had for day ...I wanted to be able to fit into a pair of jeans my husband liked for his birthday which is day . I am wearing those jeans right now lol. They are  sizes smaller than the ones I started this journey on and still a little bit tight but arent uncomfortable. I will need to come up with another mini goal....maybe to be well established in Onderland and just be overweight instead of obese.,100DaysofKeto,cmu0cnu,2,t5_34au7

I was pretty sure that huge piece of chicken would put me over my calories for the day.  When my husband left the room I weighed the half of the chicken I did not eat and realised if I ate the rest I would go over.  So I didnt.  And I didnt wake up starving at am.

I sortaaccidentally fasted for longer than usual yesterday forgot lunch and didnt take a lunch break at work until I got home from work around  PM and once home had an large almondbreaded chicken breast breast egg servings ground up almonds and my supplements. Obviously that wasnt enough calories for the day but thats all I ended up eating yesterday other than a square of dark chocolate later on in the night. I dont do this regularly I need my veggies. Im sure its not great for me or is it? I keep reading conflicting things.When you fast are you supposed to eat up to your regular calories when you break your fast mine is ?

Counting carbs alone worked but now that Im paying attention to calories its working better. Its also setting me up for success for when I weigh less and it gets harder.

6567469,0,t3_458s8l,I used the tool to build my macro profile but I use it more as a ratio tool.  I try to eat my carbs as vegetables and have cut out all breads pastas and potatoes.  So for me my macro is really a ratio.  I want my daily food intake to be X parts fat Y parts protein and Z parts carb.  Its almost impossible to build a true and accurate macro profile.  For starters we often over estimate how active we are and under estimate how much we eat.  Also keep in mind that nutrition labels are allowed to be up to  wrong.  You could be going for a  calorie deficit on a daily basis and not being anywhere close to that if youre still eating processed foods.  Also being  off on a  calorie diet we could have been eating  calories without even knowing it.If youre not eating weighed meats and veggies every day youre going to have a tough time really being accurate.For me Im not losing as fast as some of the people here but Im averaging a pound every  or  days and Im not tracking anything.

Are you tracking CICO?  If not you should start.  I know keto is good at filling us up but it doesnt evade the laws of thermodynamicsit rather just supports muscle to prevent as much muscle loss as possible while promoting fat loss but thats only if youre under TDEE every daymost days.I usually hit a plateau around the last  lbs of every set of  lbs.  Before I started any sort of dieting I was around  and it took me a solid  months to get solidly into the s but I wasnt doing CICO just exercising a fucklot.

My hunger is definitely diminishing and its just telling my brain that Im not really hungry. I havent weighed in at all this week. Last time we did strick keto it took me about  weeks to really see my first woosh but I wasnt as strick on my calorie intake. This time I upped my deficit and hopefully can go under that even. ,100DaysofKeto,d6m4igg,8,t5_34au7
8659522,0,t3_4yfple,For inspiration for myself and for all you guys I thought Id share some of the super delicious Keto foods that Ive cooked over the last year or so. Sorry Im terrible with recipes and throw all sorts of stuff in and never measure it but if you want I can give you a rough idea of whats involved. I dont really like doing ketocheats of highcarb foods and desserts and would much rather make something truly delicious that is low carb in and of itself. So I research what veg cheeses and sauces I can get away with and only use those. Oh and Im in the UK so apologies in advance for strange ingredientsmeasures. ,100DaysofKeto,d6o2126,3,t5_34au7

10170634,0,t3_5ljhsl,Hi! Im a  year old woman who did keto a little over  years ago. In  months I lost  pounds. I was looking pretty good but had a bunch left to lose. I decided to take a week long break during a move to not inconvenience anyone else in the family during that time of our lives being upside down. That week turned into  years. On the  year anniversary of me quitting keto I bought a treadmill and started up again and was doing fine until I caught a stomach virus a week later. I was miserable and week and nearly everything threatened to make me sick. So when my brain told me only crackers were okay I lived on crackers for another week. I dont even like crackers. Whatever. I decided to get through the holidays and go again. No looking back. When my family left for the holidays I weighed myself at .. This really upset me because I always said my highest weight was  but it was actually . and I said  for simplicity. Now my highest weight really is . . to be exact. So that was a few days ago. Ive lost  pounds down to . or . I dont remember but I updated it correctly this morning while the info was fresh lol which is my  day starting point. I hate that I undid so much progress. I hate that I went back to foods that make my stomach and joints hurt all the time. I hate that I hate my body. I have the thought of going on vacation and wearing a bikini at a size . My vacation is planned for late March right at the end of this challenge. I plan to be well under  and at least semi comfortable at the beach. ,100DaysofKeto,dbwwb81,2,t5_34au7

Wheeeeee!!!Ive done vlcd keto before Cambridge and Exante with success but they arent sustainable and they really dont teach you a longterm lifestyle change lesson so thought I would do it properly this time. It seems soooooo much easier when you can eat solid yummy foods rather than shakes and slightly dry bars!My body was in some kind of hyper mode last night after day  and I think I managed about  hours of sleep... Normally this would have me eating ALL of the sugar to get through the day but I have resisted the goodies in the office and stuck to my meatcheesemeat fest and feel great.Religiously tracking everything on MFP and double checking against packaging  keto feeds my OCD D,100DaysofKeto,dbyr31b,2,t5_34au7
