1342841,0,t3_29g8ps,I assume you disconnected the trailer first?Did you let air out of your tyres? If you are really stuck ive seen people drive at psi for short distances. Traction boards are good as a last resort. They are a lot of work but sometimes theres no choice.Got a shovel? Digging is remarkably effective on the right terrain.If you are really stuck take everything seats doors whatever out of the vehicle to reduce weight.Diff locks definitely help lots but are the most expensive.Snow chains arent great you cant fit them once youre stuck and you cant drive at any sort of speed. Even revving a bit to clear the tyres risks them flying off.And obviously winches work well but you need a tree rock or ground anchor.Highlifts are good too but they are a lot of work. Can be used as a winch too.,4x4,cikoo9h,1,t5_2qu1p

I would love these lights because as of now my only forward facing clear illumination is my headlights and good scene lighting is key when doing a search for clues near a missing subjects vehicle for example safety and when night falls and the narrow roads with cliffs on either side creep up on you from out of the trees.I have all the wiring relays and switches needed left over from the lights I put on my D and I just got a branch fuse block from Blue Sea Systems a few days ago these would hook nicely into. Remeber folks circuit protection is essential. I would be glad to install and send proof of light installation the day after they arrive. I would provide an in depth review in the coming days.Picture of my rig in a momentary edit.EDIT Went out to my truck shook the plate and Im not sure its strong enough. That front bumber is on its way out anyway I have a custom fabbed one coming from my friends commercial shop in a month or so. I withdraw my candidacy only due to a weak license plate mount.

Some I used to frequent were highlifter atvconnection etc. I think ATVs are an easier route to go because they are more durable and easier to fix than truckssuvs. Also if you break your trucksuv then what are you going to do take the bus to work? Rolling over an ATV on a hill is dangerous but rolling over your runner  totaled unless you have a roll cage. Also for an SUV youre going to want more aggressive tires at least a rearlocker and probably a lift before you can really tackle some good trails. For that price you are at or close to a used ATV.,4x4,cqjvs77,7,t5_2qu1p

3800859,0,t1_cqph6bk,gtIm afraid not...land vehicles.Youre right about the reliability of diesels however that doesnt mean there arent extremely reliable gas engines such as the AMC . or Toyota R series. When I said they have good low end I was referring to the high torque they make and I already mentioned mpg so you are essentially restating what I already said here. I see the advantages I just dont think they are enough to cause the obsession with them that the x crowd seems to have. gt please tell me about any gas engine with reasonable displacement that can give you  ft lbs of torque at usable rpms and still provide usable fuel economy.How about the new Ford . ecoboost? Show me a L NA diesel that isnt a slug.gtAll exhaust gases smell noxious even gasoline its just not as pungent but they are just as toxic. with an open top x youre going to be breathing in exhaust gases no matter what youre driving.Of course gas smells but its not nearly as strong as diesel. gtAn extra  or so pounds for increased reliability mpg durability range and torque is small price to pay for all those benefits.As for weight a quick google search says that a Jeep . is around lbs a SBF is about lbs SBC is about lbs and a bt is about lbs. Thats a big difference for someone trying to keep their rig from becoming a bloated pig.gtThats merely your opinion I personally think a turbo diesel spooling up is the most glorious sound regardless the sound an engine makes really is not a valid point when arguing how good or bad it is.Youre right its just my opinion that diesels sound like crap but Id bet most people would agree a SBC sounds worlds better than a diesel.gtthe rpm range may be small but at least you have max torque through like  of it unlike a gas engine where the torque band is super short.My . makes  of its torque off idle and continues until around k. Id hardly call that a short torque curve.gtactually on average it is only  to  cents more than regular gasoline and considering it gives you on average  more fuel efficiency I dont see how you cant see how beneficial this is for off roaders since each gallon you carry will give you more miles.I dont keep track of diesel prices to closely but every friend of mine that drives a diesel has said the extra mpg are lost on the higher prices.gtand Im not talking about driving your wrangler in circles through your buddies property im talking people who do real off roading and do full length trails through mountains deserts canyons etcIf you want to discuss the advantagesdisadvantages of diesels thats great but keep the insults to yourself. ,4x4,cqpj0m7,0,t5_2qu1p

Hell lift up the floor mats and you will find a cover plate screwed onto the tunnel where the gear shift will go. The beautiful part with Chevy is that there is a WIDE range of years you can scavenge parts from.Not to get the FordChevy war going but back when I was younger this exact reason was why I preferred Chevys. Ive worked on both And the both needed working and the Chevys were always much easier to find parts that would fit. Ford seemed to make random changes so that parts from two different model years might not fit like you thought they would when you started the project.What? a  hood wont work with a  front clip!?!!? WTF!?!!! THEY LOOK THE SAME!!!! Note Im not sure of the exact years of my analogy but I have seen that issue come up with model years in that range.Also Ive done plenty of  straight six to small block swaps on Chevys. I was involved with a  straight to  windsor swap once. After three days of custom fabricating parts test fitting and what not I decided that I would never own an old Ford truck.Now both companies do random shit so I personally dont have a preference.

6562411,0,t1_czy0d9l,If you want a Toyota I would go with the Runner Tacoma or FJ Cruiser in that order. Only reason I put FJ last is because they will be the most expensive relative to age. Otherwise they are the most capable of the . Used Tacomas also hold their value well as most trucks do. If you often have to haul things you would need a truck bed for or that would be a great option. runners will go for the cheapest and if you can find one with the rd row option will seat the most people. I have a th gen Runner  V Limited no rd row and I LOVE it.As far as lifts go with any of those three I would get a suspension lift dont waste your money on a body lift. A  inch lift will be ideal giving you plenty of realistic offroad capability without comprising on road performance too much. You really dont need more than that with a Toyota truck unless you plan to do some serious rock crawling. I would highly recommend the complete Old Man Emu suspension on all  trucks. I have a combination of different  suspension components Bilstien s all around with Old Man Emu  springs up front and Icon inch lift springs in the rear and yields a . in lift just like the complete OME lift. Whatever you decide to go with avoid coil spacers. They are cheaper but do not give you as much of an improvement in performance and put more strain on the stock suspension components. Replacing shocks and coil springs or leafs if Tacoma is the way to go.As fast as armor goes wait to replace bumpers until you realize you need them. If you just plan on overlanding or light wheeling chances are you wont need steel bumpers. Heavy dusty aftermarket skid plates are really only necessary again if you are going to wheel it hard. The stock skids are there for a reason.Whatever you decide to go with wheel it lightly stock and slowly build as you need. New suspension should be the first addition along with other essential overland gear. If your stock bumpers are getting damaged wheeling or you skids are getting bashed in completely they youll know you need beefier replacements,4x4,czy3w6z,1,t5_2qu1p

7236544,0,t1_d1x2zwt,Depending on your income I would not recommend a new vehicle if you are doing much more than overlanding. It is not my preference to scratchdentgenerally beat up a new vehicle off road. It is also my opinion that full size is not the way to go but I like trail riding so I prefer something smaller and with more maneuverability. I bought a  toyota pickup for about  it had about k on it. I have gone through a lot of the mechanical systems to make sure it wasnt in bad shape. The beauty of a used beater in okish condition is that I dont worry about rubbing up against trees or rocks. The paint job is a rattle can primer black and the body has multiple dents so a few more is no big deal. I guess I dont want to have to fuss over keeping it like new I am out there to have fun not worry about the appearance of the truck or the resale value. Finally and this is based on your income and interest I would learn how to turn some wrenches. Offroading can become expensive rather quickly as I am finding out. Being able to mechanic on your stuff will save you heaps of cash and you learn how to fix stuff so when it breaks on the trail you arent screwed wreckers dont do offroad. Just my two cents you can take it or leave it. What ever you end up doing I will tell you it is loads of fun. ,4x4,d20qqy5,1,t5_2qu1p

I also completely rebuilt mine about a year ago when the head gasket blew previous owner used cheap Chinese parts smh and ended up boring it . over so that gave it a marginal amount of extra power.But I digress.

The factory alternator is weak and nighttime low speed offroading with the lights and offroad lights going would draw down the battery. The alternator belt would start squealing as the alternator fought to max the output. My fix was to snip the power to the fan and add a toggle switch to turn it off. Later I got an alternator from a ton and whatever the output is from that one it solved all my electrical problems so I guess my fan will last longer since it is off  of the time.I am guessing the fix for the traction control is similar.,4x4,d3ygcyu,1,t5_2qu1p

10427902,0,t1_dcpytbh,Not true. The military uses diesel because of standardization. All of the big trucks are diesel multifuel actually and you want every vehicle in your fleet to be able able to share the same fuel. Its much more cost effective to only have to buy and store  fuel type en masse than . Also have to be able to share with our allies as well. Same with bullets we all use the same calibers for cost and logistical effectiveness. A cast iron diesel motor is no tougher than a cast iron petrol motor. Diesels have less moving parts and put out less power by and large so there is less load on the engine.,4x4,dcq2kw1,11,t5_2qu1p

Itll make it more fun to drive but also might make the motor less reliable especially considering its age. Swapping in a different motor with more stock power would be a good compromise to building up an old one.Bottome line in an overlanding vehicle reliability trumps power.

Rear trash bag holder all trims dual glovebox dual sun visors one that does what any vehicle does with another one underneath so you can block out both the windshield and side at the same time. many other useful features. Im serious. Cup holders in all doors  under stereo  pop out in the center rear passenger seat with pop out snack tray. Sport is basically an appearance package hood scoop round rack and steps rear spoiler can be added to all trims. Sport seats water proof xreas suspension. Limiteds. Add  inch rims. Heated Leather if equipped automatic leveling rear struts.  tier loading available on all trims.  disc jbl stereo system and speakers. Nav optional DVD package optional color matched side mirrors. Light up steps.  All trims have a sunroof. But there are few that do not. But most do. Rear hatch window rolls down. All gens have that feature. The rd gen isnt bad either. Just stay away from . v models. th gen v is timing chain. V has the belt. x v is part time. V models are awd all the time. Fuel economy and acceleration are roughly the same. But if course the v is more torquey naturally. The th gen is roughly the same size as your grand Cherokee. So no sacrifice in interior space. They have lots of aftermarket support. And for  you can drop a supercharger in it v and v specifically built for those engines. By URD underdog racing development. These are pretty peppy from the get go. But the supercharger gives you minimum hp. And unlike grand Cherokee sr models. They are reliable as hell. And sacrifice minimal mpg. Besides the sr is more so a street suv. But imagine having that power and STILL being able to off roadoverland with it.I suggest  and later. Since  and prior v were spd. And after  they get a face lift with an hp boost. But up fix the very minimal issues the previous models had. After  fr side airbags become standard. Only available on limiteds before and as an option on other trims prior to .Stock they handle better than most off road. Build it up. It only makes it better. In short. They do pay for themselves. Hence why they retain their value so strong. If it was taken care of. They are very very worth buying. And like all vehicles. If you live in the rust belt. Check for frame rust. Just like you would on a jeep or anything else. That will destroy any car. Even Toyota. The only TRUE competitor was the Nissan Xterra. But those have been discontinued.

And have reliability that is unmatched by anything outside of Toyota. Roomy and safe. Can seat up to  in rd row models.  tow rating is lbs. Except for the th gen with the v which is lbs. On the same frame that Tacoma uses. Roughly same size. Except Tacoma is open bed runner an suv. Not a crossover but a legit suv. A x runner can handle all that you listed. FROM FACTORY.  Tacoma x isnt bad at all. And they are very capable from factory. Wrangler is x. And still king off road. But they pay the price in pathetic reliability. For the money a Tacoma or th gen runner. Would not only do MOST what you plan. But last a long long time to boot. With a k budget. That would get you a late model th gen runner x. With under k on it. Around .

For the most part Wharton is sand paths and overflow from creeks. Ive seen several references to Lo but Ive never legitimately needed to drop down to low range or even air down my tires. Some main tips are to cross any water carefully obviously and stay on the shallow side of the puddles when going through sand turn off traction control and stay in other wheel tracks and bring boards and a shovel because you will probably get stuck once or twice.
