Clapping for percussion done lazily boring falsetto trying to be nothing but whimsical and scatterbrained both musically and lyrically boring riffs that dont hook you in at all...Its just so Vanilla. If youve heard one of these bands youve heard them all. Never heard of them Steering far away from this band Hills of Indigo Blues  That was at least lively and kind of catchy Slow Your Breath Down  The most boring song especially because of the guitars and vocals. Rating this .. I need to eat a steak.,365music,cntqojm,1,t5_35x2o
2889106,0,t3_2t7jnr,Oh here we go. Radiohead are my favourite band and In Rainbows is definitely among my favourite of their records even if its hard to compete with OK Computer and Kid A. I find that this album does a splendid job mixing different styles covered on the previous albums and overall just perfecting what Radiohead is. It has guitars it has electronica it has beautiful songwritingIn Rainbows has it all. At the same time somehow the album stands out as one of the bands most accessible records with songs like Jigsaw and Bodysnatchers not being unlikely candidates for radio hits.Favourite track is a tough one as the album to me is really strong from beginning to end. Nude and Reckoner might be the two that stand out with the former winning by a hairs width if for no other reason than it being the first song that really left me awestruck when listening for the first time. Its such a simple composition that still stands out as being so very beautiful not least because of Thom Yorkes haunting vocals. It still manages to give me goosebumps ever so often.Least favourite track is difficult too though Id probably have to say Faust Arp what with it being the shortest song by far and generally feeling a bit like an interlude. A very effective interlude though as it bridges nicely between the dark somewhat pessimistic sounds of All I Need and the bright hauntingly beautiful Reckoner.Man this album is so good. It has long earned its spot on my list of albums that transcend songwriting and music to actually feel like a piece of art. I realise how pretentious that sounds but In Rainbows just has an incredible effect on me. Certainly one of my candidates for best albums of the st century so far.,365music,cnwhtfs,2,t5_35x2o
