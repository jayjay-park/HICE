87630,0,t1_ceoeit2,Sort of. Its very slight. Within the game much like Animal Crossing you are given a place to decorate etc. This time its the cafe. Once you level up enough you have a bedroom above the cafe too. Theres something like ish sets including DLC of cafebedroom furniture and cafe food to match the furniture theme. Anyway. There is a way to upload your cafe so people can visit it randomly or if they are on your DS friends list  and if they do you can bring them to town as if you had street passed them. Basically then you can greet them and they will give you a random trading card. Theres  of these and I only have  of them still.  EDIT to add Oh yeah! You can choose to like! someones cafe and if you do this enough times you get some extra outfits. Theyre funny. The people can technically sit down and eat in your cafe or you can in someone elses if there is food in stock. You can also go check out peoples rooms above the cafe. You cant go out into town though which is sort of disappointing. There IS downloadable content  so far theres been a few extra cafe sets some Tshirts and headbands a few wands and a Pirates of the Caribbean world. But none of them are really online play. The AR cards have been well done in Japan too. Bunch of stuff at release regular additions to it as weve gone on. Ive gotten like  teddy bears from the Disney StoreIm almost hoping they will expand on some of this with the US release Im moving home in April and this seals my decision to get a NA DS as well but I sort of doubt it. ,3DS,ceoem30,2,t5_2ruhy

For the last its apparently a great game to just leave running with the system closed as you build up Sleep Points which are also what youre able to buy through the games microtransactions making them somewhat useless to buy.

The remaining  or so Pokemon are available from other regions only so youll need to trade for them. I had the best luck leveraging my Xexclusives for lowest evolution pokebank Pokemon deposited on the GTS. Then Id evolve those pokemon to their final form and trade it on the GTS for another equivalent Pokebankmon. Once I got an Oshawott I bred about two boxes worth and traded for just about any other low level Bank Pokemon I needed. Its very time consuming but very doable. ,3DS,cewb4li,2,t5_2ruhy

They are both amazing games though.As for DKCRD Ive played the original but Im not huge on platformers and its not very long for the price. Ive also owned ACNL and its definitely designed for a certain type of person... a person with friends who own the game as well basically.

249848,0,t3_1wyb94,It really depends on what kind of game experience you want.If you are the creative type and you can see yourself ending up spending hours slaving over patterns and textures and customizing furniture designing your town and your house then New Leaf is for you.  If you have a collectors soul and a hoarder then New Leaf is for you.If you do not like having no specific goals if you want some semblance of plot if swinging a hoe at monsters and watering plants makes you happy and romancing the butlerintraining is appealing to you get Rune Factory .They have things in similar planting fishing chores.  The chores in New Leaf are less crucial than in RF imo as the only thing that will drive you to do them is your own greed how much do you REALLY want that bell sofa? whereas doing the chores in RF is directly beneficial to your characters stats and in acquiring useful items for dungeon exploring and not fainting halfway through.  In a sense the chores in Rune Factory are more like chores than Animal Crossing.  You can be a lazy waste of space in Animal Crossing and it wont make a difference to the town if you have the right ordinances in place.  Time also moves differently in ACNL time marches on with or without you.  RF time only passes while playing.  And also as others have mentioned RF may become pretty rare so consider that too.I personally favor Animal Crossing I always have.  The endless choices for customization the chance to build my perfect outfit my perfect houses and my perfect town from the ground up and fill it only with the most adorable creatures are appealing to me.  However there is a type of person who would violently hate it and be bored by it.  If you want a relaxing game to chill with and in which some events are just out of your control nothing happening today? thats life. come back tomorrow. some bastard just built his house in your perfect fruit orchard? sorry. that ugly green duck is moving away? REJOICE get it by all means.  But if you want a fasterpaced game with shorter days that you can drop and pick up whenever you want then maybe Rune Factory  is a better choice.TLDR Get New Leaf,3DS,cf6nfve,1,t5_2ruhy

332907,0,t1_cff8egh,This is super pedantic.  And I think the legal case you are creating here is not as cut and dry as you are presenting it to be.  I doubt nintendo or any publisher would want to take someone to court if they could prove they were making backups for fear of losing that case.  ltltIsnt it legal to copy computer and video games as a backup as long as you own a legitimate copy? U.S. Copyright laws permit making a backup copy of computer programs for archival purposes. However the right to make backup copies of computer programs for archival purposes as embodied in  U.S.C. Section  does not in any way authorize the owner of a copy of a video or computer game to post or download a copy of that game to or from the Internet or make such copy available to other people for their use.  Section  only gives the owner of the copy a right to make an archival copy of the actual copy that heshe legally possesses not to make a copy of the ROM that someone else legally possesses nor to post an archival copy of hisher original copy for distribution. The law clearly does NOT provide any right to sell backup copies. In fact Section  is quite explicit in stating that any archival copy prepared under Section  can only be transferred to another person if and only if A The original copy is also transferred and only with the authorization of the copyright owner and B The transfer is part of the sale of all rights in the program.gtgt,3DS,cff9ylc,5,t5_2ruhy

465793,0,t1_cft5qbo,Yeah I think itll be a pass for me in the end. The writing of a game is pretty important to me as well and a well written game is still annoyingly difficult to come across even now.On a side note it upsets me that the general census about games these days is Yeah the writing is poor but the gameplay is decent!. I wish more people cared about the quality of writing and story telling in games. Mainstream games journalists are bad at praising garbage.

471533,1,t3_1zhoy9,Ok so bravely default is the latest hot game for ds and it does have a portion of the game thats actually quite like a freemium social network game. It might pique your interest and if that portion of the game isnt worth the money it comes with that very pretty jrpg everyones been talking about attached to it.Bravely second might include that portion of the game too and if its done right it would blow me out of the water.Having played clash of clans however I can relate to the itch that must be scratched. Though its an entirely different type of game Rune Factory might be the butt scratcher for the job Ill admit I havent played the latest but the previous games had that nice balance of farming and exploring that goes a way to that same farmvilly feeling.Theres plenty more games that I would have not yet tried mainly due to constantly falling back to monster hunter when I try play something new on my ds.,3DS,cftv63u,-2,t5_2ruhy

525136,0,t1_cfzyfxw,Well the biggest problem is that its too big both in physical dimensions and screen size.I actually use my DS as a portable system and the DSXL is just a tad too big to slip into my pocket everyday for steps and streetpasses.On top of that the screen is too big. While trying my girlfriends DSXL I felt like I had to hold the system at arms length to see the entire screen. I was constantly struggling with seeing the entire screen or having the D effect work properly I could never get both working in tandem properly. On top of that the enlarged pixels cause the image to look overly muddy and I wasnt crazy about that.On the more petty side of things the DSXL just looks and feels cheaper.

Youre stuck to using the DSs old crappy Wifi connection tools for example you also cant go to the home screen. Really its just a bog standard implementation by Nintendo which is disappointing. The PSVita for example pretty much treats games from all platforms as the same vita psp psone mobile only keeping their saves and configs separate.I suppose the main difference in a DS battery is that youre encouraged to keep it on in sleep mode. The DSLite doesnt have that has the best battery of any Nintendo handheld since the Gameboy so is perfect if youre just into playing DS games.

745021,0,t1_cgoybqc,I will agree with your conclusion but not your reasoning. Ive played every Legend of Zelda game and the original is still one of my favorite games ever.The reason Ocarina of Time is so valued is that it was the first expansive world played in D.  Mario did D first and did it just as well but in Mario there were clearly defined levels with a hub world.  Zelda was one united world.  It was the first game to give that full roaming experience in three dimensions.  That is why it is often considered the greatest game ever.  Growing up and playing Zelda games were great.  A Link to the Past is probably a better game than Ocarina of Time but people who played Ocarina of Time when it first came out were blown away by what it brought.  It and Mario  set the mold for video games moving forward.  Every game in that generation was trying to be them.,3DS,cgoyrb0,1,t5_2ruhy

837316,0,t1_cgz1mn1,well straight up currency conversion wise these prices work in NA. we are only paying  or  in canada for the game and converting those british prices of the dlc means we pay  or  in canada to get all  courses and  characters. thats a good deal here. sorry it seems like a lot more in the UK. mind you when that stuff is released here it could end up being more.  pack of dlc is about  from the conversion. they will probably end up charging anywhere from  each for them. still  for basically another half game is fine in my book. its like nslu sized content. more than most dlcs for that price.wonder how this stuff will work with local multiplayer. everyone would probably need the dlc.  would be cool if only the host needs it.,3DS,cgzgese,-1,t5_2ruhy

Its one thing to have arbitrary and rigid rules for your own English but its dickish to impose those same rules on others. Usage dictionaries are dead and obsolete and so is Fowler.

At times my heart is beating so fast because of my anxiety it makes it hard to fall asleep. However when I finally get to rest my eyes lay my head on the nice soft pillow and pull the warm layers of blanket over my body Im out! Its like a place where I can fully enjoy myself without having any consequences or the fear of something bad happening. My trigger is school and the workload that goes with it. Although I do well in school it is my biggest fear. I dont sleep in class because I want to keep my grades up but getting home and knowing that I can rest makes me the happiest person alive. I know that sounds ridiculous but it is my sanctuary of serenity and peace. I am about to graduate high school in about a week from now and have already been accepted to college. Im really happy yet Im so nervous because I know it is going to be a lot harder when it finally hits me.

910594,0,t3_24j8p4,ENTERING Ive been suffering from depression for nearly half of my life.  It first became prevalent when I was in th grade back in  when my best friends father who was like a second father to me passed away in a car accident.  Everyone in the neighborhood was stunned but I took it particularly hard.  This man was always around and willing to do whatever the kids wanted.  Hed ride bikes play sports watch TV play video games...everything.  He taught me how to play baseball and helped me get really REALLY good at it.  After he passed I quit baseball my friend moved away and the neighborhood was never the same.  The kids no longer frolicked in the streets or played baseball in the nearby park or rode bikes around like maniacs.  It was a tough time for everybody but I just havent ever been able to get past thinking about what my life would be if he hadnt left us so soon.So theres my story.EDIT I totally didnt answer the question...guess I sort of got off track.  Ive been lucky enough to find a companion that recognizes my needs and is there to help me when Im having a particularly bad episode.  Ive learned to deal with all the things that come with depression and am able to remain conscious that I WILL get through whatever it is that has gotten me down.  It definitely helps to have an incredibly supportive wife though.,3DS,ch7sgrg,2,t5_2ruhy

1048058,0,t3_2637cz,I feel like Im  in a million I absolutely treasured my Virtual Boy. When I was on vacation over one summer my house was broken into and all of my video games were stolen. I had the entire collection of Mega Man for the NES the NES my Genesis and most of my Sega games stolen. But my Virtual Boy... man that was a swift kick to the balls.The summer I got it this was right before the Ultra  was about to drop and the price for it was somewhere below the  mark I dont think I stopped playing Wario Land unless I was eating or sleeping. I never got a headache. I suppose I was one of the lucky ones. Mario Tennis was pretty cool too. I had a friend where I visited in Virginia for summers Im from Florida but most of my family lives in VA so thats the answer to where Floridians go for vacation  family haha who had Vertical Force and I was so fricken jealous. I loved that game as well.Those are the only  I ever got to experience and one summer while I was away and left it unguarded  somebody stole it like they stole the rest of my childhood right out from underneath me. I havent picked one up since I mean they arent too expensive but I really cannot explain the cost to my wife we have plenty of video games and systems already to the point where we have more than we ever have the time to play.If they brought these to the DS man that would be a blast. Getting the King Dragon hat in Wario Land slamming a ball into a Marios face and finding the best upgrades in Vertical Force these are all great things I would experience again and again if I could. Unfortunately VB has gotten such a bad rap that wed be more likely to get a proper Seiken Densetsu sequelremake than see VB games be released. But... hope. Hope is alive.

1182230,0,t3_27nmjp,This is not a joke. Elite Beat Agents is one of my favorite games ever made. Not just for the DS but ever. Its up there with OoT Tetris SM and Fallout for me. Its a game that by all accounts should simply not exist outside of Japan. Its a U.S. translation both in songs and some storyartsound design changes. In it you tap slide and spin the stylus all around the touch screen to the on screen queues from music. Sounds basic. And it kinda is. At least from a mechanical perspective. But what EBA had over almost all other games in existence is style. The Elite Beat Agents are an international organization of cheerleaders most of them malethat alone should be enough insane but it doesnt stop. They have unlimited funding. Incredible science and gadgetry at their disposal and enough vehicles to make Batman blush. What do they do with this power? Simple. They cheer everyday people along in sometimes mundanesometimes not tasks to completion. You control the Agents. By performing the songs better you will encourage your marks more and you will help directors shoot films travel though time assist ninjas escaping secret bases and maybe even save the world.The game includes mostly pop and rock tunes from a good  year spread. Its colorful has great soundobviously and incredibly well done and challenging gameplay. There are about  tiers of difficulty and you unlock them and more songs as you help the citizens of the world study for tests.Simply do not miss Elite Beat Agents.,3DS,ci2mci6,19,t5_2ruhy

1496440,0,t3_2bc6sl,It depends.  If the previous owner created a NNID the game is irrevocably tied to his or her account and you can never reclaim it.  If they didnt check your eShop account under the Settings Other tab from there you can redownload any game that is tied to your system but not attached to a NNID.  It is then tied to your NNID permanently.            Taking your SD card out during the reformatting process doesnt save the data as you need permission to access it.  That permission is lost when you reformat because it is tied to the system of origin which is erased upon reformatting.  So any games or saves you had saved to the SD card are now just wasting memory as you cant access them anymore.,3DS,cj3uqmg,3,t5_2ruhy

There are tons of weapons you can get each with different stats even the same kind of weapon can have different stats!. You can also equip powers you can activate on the Touch Screen by fitting pieces onto a grid.Theres a basic rundown. I highly recommend this game.

1506053,0,t3_2bfn0g,Persona Q is by far the least Persona game you can play in the series. Not only is it a spinoff that mashes in  and  the gameplay is different the social aspect is not there and the battles themselves are much different. Persona Q is Etrian Odyssey with a Persona skin. Persona Q would also confuse you since it references the past games so if you do happen to like Etrian Odyssey gameplay the plot might confuse you a bit. If you happen to have a PS Vita you can play PG and PP also the PS has P PES and if you do manage to play P P Arena is like a follow up that is actually relevant to the plot and it includes characters for P last bit is that P is coming to PS at some point. Oh but if your only system is the DS then you can definitely play SMT IV its on sale on the eshop right now and it will give you a similar feeling since Persona games are actually spin offs of SMT games.,3DS,cj523x4,3,t5_2ruhy

Its getting pretty old at this point and can probably be found for pretty cheap. Look up some reviews for gameplay but heres a quick synopsis.  There are  parts to the game. The air battles and the land battles. Every stage has  of each and theres boss battles strewn about the game as well. The air battles are a crazy high action shoot em up a la Star Fox. The land battles are more like a third person shooter. The land parts are adequately large and theres a little bit of exploring to do too. The main game is about  hours long? Maybe a little shorter but theres some great replay value because of the difficulty slider. Good game.,3DS,cjcd078,2,t5_2ruhy

1570189,0,t3_2c8w8p,I think its much better than Crystal Shards movement is much faster and copy abilities have large movesets just like Super Star and Return to Dream Land its basically RtDLs engine.Story is easy as always and a little on the short side but there are plenty of collectables and if its playstyle challenges youre interested in doing a full run without copy powers has always been a perennial favorite among Kirby fans. Also beating the main story unlocks The Arena based on Super Stars boss rush with the same name and Dededetour! a speedrun focused mode where you play through a slightly harder not much the clock is the real challenge version of the story as Dedede. Beating both of those unlocks The True Arena featuring much harder bosses and more limited healing just like in Super Star Ultra. For some perspective on how much harder it is I beat The Arena on my first try and then it took me two weeks to beat The True Arena.Streetpass is used to get keychains and it exchanges your best times in The Arena Dededetour! and The True Arena. Most players probably wont care but I like the competitive aspect trying to beat everyone elses times. No online or anything though.Also the extra modes included Kirby Fighters and Dedede Drum Dash are plenty of fun.,3DS,cjd3hso,5,t5_2ruhy

Nintendo did not make the ds with  the intention of fps games in mind. The Vita has duel analog sticks allowing better camera and movement control however the few fps games have been released for the Vita are not very good and wont come close to comparison with home consoles. Another thing to note in deciding which one to getPlayStation is dropping the Vita same as they did with the PSP  meaning there will be no support and updates as well not many new games being released to join the already small game list the Vita currently has. Vita is good for Indie games thoughNintendo is still pushing strong with the ds and has a more publicised following. Along with the many games that are supported from the original DS collection there is the continued flow of new ds games.Bottom line dont buy a handheld for fps games because you will be disappointed.Remember this is just my take on it talk the fact from the bias. ,3DS,cjg21dn,1,t5_2ruhy

I was talking for about the GBGBA games and to a certain extent A Link to the Past.  But the dungeons in the DS games play similar to D games so I guess its almost the same.

None of which are really a source you would want to cite if you want to be at all respected. Their articles generally amount to a few paragraphs of something thats already been said elsewhere. The people who write those articles are the absolute biggest dicks you will ever meet they delete and ban any negative comments or comments that correct mistakes. Not sure about now but for a while every other article was pretty much Omg Japan! And this Japan and that Japan and did you know I live in Japan and this happened?! Basically Kotaku is tabloid video game journalism at best. Its like reading DailyMail or National Inquirer. Its bottom of the barrel for a place to get your video game news and reviews and such. Combine that with the fact that the Gawker Network in general is shit and youve got plenty of reason to find another gaming news site. Remember Gizmodo are the guys banned from CES for being dicks. Gizmodo are the guys who got someone fired over a prototype iPhone. A bunch of Gawker sites get called out on their copypaste clickbait and they just delete it and ban the commenter. Also the entire way the site is setup is clickbait. There was a time when you could go to a site and get a good summary of the article before clicking through.

1775553,0,t3_2etew6,Alright heres advice from someone doing the same thing as you.Persona  and  are totally unrelated to anything else persona you can skip them.Persona  is something you DO need and if you want to finish your story with PP then you need to find the Persona  FES that has The Answer. PP only covers the first half of the story called The Journey.Persona  is also something you need and its a pity you cant get golden. Theres an anime called Persona  Golden The Animation that will fill you in with the stuff you missed but dont watch it until youre done with Persona  to avoid spoilers.Coming out Sept. th is Persona  Arena Ultimax which ties into  and  much like Q will but Im not sure how much will be referenced in Q. Its an upgrade of Persona  Arena so you can skip that title for this one.If youre at all too lazy to play the games Persona  has a currently incomplete series of movies and Persona  The Animation will give you the jist of the game which you can then follow up with the Golden Animation. Have fun!,3DS,ck2yooj,2,t5_2ruhy

1788661,0,t1_ck4ika1,It seriously isnt that pertinent.  I agree with you  New DS is a misnomer.Consoles dont have rational names though.  Xbox  progressed to Xbox One.  That threw everyone for a loop  and it probably has something to do with it being the least sold new gen console worldwide right now  maybe?Lets talk about Playstation.  Playstation .  Thats pretty awesome Sony hit that one out of the ballpark.  PSP and PSP Vita though?  Not sure about that  the Vita looks exactly like its predecessor and relied on info getting out to the masses about its differences.  The Vita is currently considered a failure BUT..Wii gt Wii U.  Everyone actually knows the Wii U was a new system but it just didnt have the games until recently Mario Kart .  That game still isnt enough to be a flagship until Smash .

Since we are English we cant make the distinction.If it was in our market Nintendo DS  Nintendo DS XL Nintendo Nuevo DS  Nintendo Nuevo DS XLthen when we go to the store we wouldnt mistake saying I want a new DS with I want a Nuevo DS.Hopefully this makes sense.Its still a stupid name.,3DS,ck4w19x,9,t5_2ruhy

But as others have said it can be helpful to keep the old weapons for training units etc. Unless you really really need the money theres not a whole lot to gain by selling a halfused iron sword.To get support convos they dont have to be paired. They can also just be next to each other. Pairing is a little more of a guarantee though so they dont do the battle with a different character thats next to them than the one you intended. To be honest I barely used pairing throughout the game.

Accurate emulation takes quite a bit more processing power to do and Nintendo likes their emulation to be accurate.If you want to read why it takes so much here is a good writeup talking about higans emulation. Now nintendo doesnt need as much power as pc would use since they know both the DS and the system to be emulated inside and out they designed both afterall but its still take a bit more than you might think.The faster CPU in the new DS x faster I believe? might be Nintendos answer for SNES emulation on DS but they havent given any details yet so its just speculation til then...,3DS,ckid93h,2,t5_2ruhy

At home I have a console and I generally dont go out with the purpose of playing games.Smash DS is technically impressive and overall very neat but at the end of the day it is still a pareddown version of a game that is pretty much made to be played on a TV with a controller.

1971477,0,t3_2h2v9x,Hey! Few questions since Im coming back to playing my ds again.My PC is out of commission so Ive been playin my other consoles for the time being but have a few questions about my DS. . its old been sitting on a charger since I finished XY and battery life seems to be really low. Is there a way to replace the battery? Or what is the average battery life?. the top has some hairline scratches but nothing too noticeable except in the right light and the bottom has a lot more noticeable ones. Its kinda a collectors piece for me the ds that came with OoT D so is it possible to buff those out? It isnt one solid color so Im not sure I could do it the same way I did my WiiU.. my right bumper is broken completely and my left one is finicky but they both still click. Is it possible to replace them? How much and how easy? . I need a game suggestion! I was looking at Rune Factory   havent played one since the original! Harvest Moon havent played one since GameCube or Bravely Default since a second one was announced. Im open to suggestions I love JRPGs Strategy and other things. My current library consists of KHDquite fun Paper Mario sticker star kinda meh wasnt what I was expecting etrian odyssey IV impulse buy but dont regret it. Actually really liked it OoT  love it pokemon x love pokemon love this just the same  FEA favorite of the FE series and favorite of my library and a couple others that are slipping my mind. Any suggestions?,3DS,ckqrhvx,2,t5_2ruhy

2004285,0,t1_ckupggf,Most Zelda games follow the same standard. An item trading quest to get an item.. Collectables to get useful items  upgrades Skulltellas in OoT and Octopus thingies in ALBW.. Three to five mini games for OoT off the top of my head Archery and Fishing then there are like  additional ones in the market.The DS OoT also has a boss battle mode where you can refight the bosses and try to get a best time. There are also a lot of hidden interactions  secrets within the game involving the use of the Ocarina and time travel.This is coming from someone who enjoys the D Zelda games as well I loved Links Awakening and the Oracle series. I would recommend both but if I had to get one Id get OoT.,3DS,ckupqov,3,t5_2ruhy

2010124,0,t3_2hrpn7,dont grind.  you get most xp from finishing quests or beating bosses anyway.  find out the enemies weaknesses and collect demons so you can fuse appropriate demons for the area.  for example if hamalight is being spammed by enemies consider fusing a demon with natural resistance to light.personally i usually fused demons with high mp and gave them a range of different spells to make them versatile.  i would then only pass on healing skills to the MC since the more times you learn a skill the cheaper it becomes healing gets pretty cheap.  plus the MC is pretty durable and can use physical or gun attacks to make up for lack of offensive skills.  eventually put a repel physicalmagic on him.,3DS,ckvf0uy,1,t5_2ruhy

2106121,0,t1_cl7dumx,There is a plot that you can choose to follow but game dont force you to do so. Instead you can play it like a life sim getting more abilities and farm items. Choosing each life gets you new possibilities to explore vast world. You can collect materials as a miner angler or woodcutter then you can craft items with acquired resources  as a carpenter or cook or get into a fighting class and use crafted swords potions and bows. On top of that you can aquire allies or pets furniture your room and so on. It goes much deeper than this because there is  lifes  classes and getting better at them is very rewarding. I reach h of gameplay now and it feels like Ive just licked the surface. Have visited maybe one third part of the world ignoring the deepest caves and woods. And I still get back to them after leveling up my status and getting better gear. ,3DS,cl7j85o,5,t5_2ruhy

2226644,0,t1_clmtgf2,While you saying that swordmans  are different I would say that even Sakurai mentioned  there is no place for Chrom in hero pool because he will be just another swordman. They are tending to be different with Shulk is an exception. Marth and Lucina are almost same damage and  moves? Ike and Miis are slightly different but gameplay almost same. Shulk is good but arent they just buffs? didnt look as very interesting idea. Robin arent classic swordman he is great I must admit. This differences you are talking about are not enough for newcomer to take any attention. You did play previous games arent you? You are familiar with characters. When I picked Ike Marth or Lucina I cant even tell difference from begin Ikes jump was his most notable for example and thats all. When you are in the details then of course there is huge difference. To make my point clearer I would say bout Lol and dota as example. While LoL creating characters you can describe in few words like shield dash enhance next aa buff with NEW COOL ULTIMATE in dota some mechanics of the basic skills cant even be described in tooltip and need to be seem or tested to understand. While technically you are right about differences of smash swordmans I dont feel like this differences are strong enough to be interesting. There are plenty faces in game but some of them just like another. That was really unexpected by me and I wouldnt pick up Smash if I knew this earlier so I shared my thoughts. Connection can be dealt with by changing room and reconnecting after bad games but I expected a bit better of online behavior. Thats why I marked that I play fightings a lot. In most of them you can play way you like and have some fun without losing so hard. Guilty Gear and KoF are examples of my favorite fightings. If you dont have mood  spam as you like. You cant go horribly wrong here. You cant fall to death. You cant really miss all action because they changed level of the platform and kicking ass while you are in climbing  edge controlling. If you want  you can play serious but not in vs its crazy. While talking about clever gameplay I am not so certainly sure but from my Robin view there is unbelievable gap between top tier characters and other. Thats not what you expect from game where you want to train and master the game. I saw less than  of roster in For Glory matches played about  games. There are great characters really meta where I see no point to beat it. Mac Rob Yoshi Falcon Pikachu and Kirby are most likely enemy you will get. Fox and Rosalina maybe. Its hard to guess someone else because you literally met them once or twice in  matches.,3DS,clmuz0a,1,t5_2ruhy

2274759,0,t3_2la7e1,some times games on that time were maded on a custom way so that the system could run it a the devs choicesay more speed better loading or better saving times the game is different on certain aspectthe nowadays emulators work fine BUT will not deliver the same if they emulate all the games the same wayMany emulators have hardcoded configurations for each rom. Reason? Some games underover clock the system use less ram or simply changed something to avoid cheating devices.The NES and GBGBC are very easy to emulate as the architecture was very simpleThe nightmare comes on the SNES and way worst on the NIt has been said that no games on the N are the same architectureYou may say But many emulators run all gamesYes but until now many emulator devs started coding the emulators to emulate the game console rather than just play the rom. It was recently that Jet Force Gemini was correctly emulated and I recall KI on is unplayable on emulatorsThis aside of the Specs on the DS makes emulator a bitch to make,3DS,clsvnv7,1,t5_2ruhy

I can say i felt pleasantly surprised how new the experience was from playing it in strict D bit graphicsbit music and the new .D ds graphicspost bit music.The only thing i recommend is use the lowest settings on the D effect. The graphics tend to fuzz and not properly achieve stereoscopic effect when the settings are set on high. They also changed certain of the game physics. Specially with weapons. And enemy hitboxes. But nothing that deters from the great story telling and overall enjoyment. As another redditor commented. It is greatly inspired by games like metroid.

You enter a new dungeon unaware of the dangers and pitfalls. You slog your way through making mistakes on the way. You may have to head back due to injuries but not to worry you have created your own map with annotations and markers. Also yes the class system is amazing.

2455318,0,t1_cmeypqr,Thanks for chiming in I too have browsed that guide although as I stated in my other reply Im actually NOT planning on using scriptscycles for crazy amounts of Streetpasses. I simply plan on cloning the MAC for the select gamecommunity I want as seen hereHOWEVER since you have done this Im much more curious about the DDWRT installation... So yeah if I type Linksys WRTGL into their router database which by the way numerous threads ON the DDWRT website have said NOT to rely on quite a few files pop up in the results.Upon checking the Additional Info in the linked Wiki page above those files it then tells me that I MUST install the ftpddwrt.comothersekoVTNGsvnddwrt.vNEWDmini.bin file.So the main questions I have for someone whos done this before are Do I use the database MINI bin file and if so do I use the WEB or TFTP version or do I trust the Wiki entry and install the NEWD mini bin? AND after figuring that out will that version of the firmware be enough to setup my LAN Wireless MAC Cloning version of Homepass? Or will I have to do a hard reset on the router and prepare to flash an ADDITIONAL firmware version onto my router in order to do so?I agree that that thread is bustling with info but it all seems to be related to cycling scripts which I never planned to use. Ive even asked there only to have my concerns over DDWRT blatantly ignored and essentially told to just switch my current nonDDWRT routers SSID to NZMcD and hope for an occasional hit without utilizing the vast MAC sharing community.,3DS,cmf6gxg,1,t5_2ruhy

2574907,0,t3_2p9dhb,Etrian Odyssey IV  Untold are fantastic games and for that matter Persona Q as well.  RPG gold thats what they are.Shantae and the Pirates Curse is probably one of the best Metroidvania games Ive ever played and it is sooooo gorgeous.  A must own.Azure Striker GUNVOLT is also dandy filling that void Capcom left with their lack of Mega Man titles lately.  Especially considering it was made by the people who were making the modern Mega Man games.Fantasy Life is an awesome RPGSimulation game with a really nice amount of character customization.  I even recommend picking up the DLC which adds a lot of stuff postgame but also a nice chunk of features for the main story.Cave Story is also a super good platformer Metroidvaniaesqe game.  Not only that but one of the best games ever made.  I cant give it higher praise.VVVVVV another fantastic platformer with a decent amount of challenge but is super liberal with its checkpoints so its not hair pulling out frustration.  Usually.Code of Princess.  Is lame.  Dont get this game I got it on sale not expecting much and I still want my money back.Mutant Mudds another platformer that is rather challenging I still havent beat it.Attack of the Friday Monsters!

Yes it does not fit well in your pocket though it does fit in most pockets at least pantsshorts for guys. I get the differences Im not an idiot but my point is that judging by whatever sales they saw between the original DS and the original XL they didnt see it fit to mass produce the standard New DS in the USA.

2862458,0,t3_2suxj1,I havent gotten to play the demo too long but my first reactions to this were positive. I love the ability to jump climb and the new landing on a monsters back during battle. Absolutely brilliant addition to the game.My one complaint is the contrast of the graphics with the D on. I rarely play with D anyways but in this game it makes the gameplay very distractinghard to view with the D turned on. My lighting is only on option  too and it really hurt my eyes so I had to just keep the D off completely. This might just be a problem with my eyes though because D tends to give me a headache anyways.I also noticed slight lag whenever I was in the battle and something major was happening the hardest monster in the demo goes kinda crazy due to a virus and starts spitting out mist and sparks and goes ape shit. The lag wasnt too noticeable but it was there. I experience lag occasionally even in Pokemon YX during certain battle moves so Im sure its normal. Im very excited to see how it runs on the NDS though. ,3DS,cntgocv,2,t5_2ruhy

When I worked retail electronics at Target I kept up with all of our products from video games to cameras to movies etc simply to be knowledgeable to customers. I did this on my own but its why I became manager before leaving there. The least GS corporate could have done was instruct their managers to inform their employees. My beef with GS this time... is that I had to go there three times and still do internet research. And if I hadnt thought to check Reddit Id be pulling my hair out right about now. Not because GS or Nintendo arent making it easy to transfer because GS put out a promo and epically failed obviously going by the number of questions out there about this issue miserably in letting their potential customers know what the living hell is going on with their promo. ,3DS,cnve232,1,t5_2ruhy

3037174,0,t1_cocsh1g,Basically.  Put your SD card in your PC.  Copy the contents onto your PC.  Eject the SD card.  Put in your MicroSD card.  At this point its a good idea to format the card but not required.  Copy the SD card files onto your MicroSD.  Eject the MicroSD.  When you get your NDS you follow the steps to do a system transfer.  Eventually it will ask how you want to proceed.  The third option via PC is what you want to do.  It will then prompt you to turn off the system and insert your loaded up MicroSD card.  So then you unscrew the back plate and change the Micro cards out.  Then you turn it back up to finish the transfer.  At now point is it necessary to delete the files off the SD card and I would not until the transfer is complete and you confirm everything is all in the green.  Then you can format the SD card to remove files if you need to.,3DS,cocsw3o,1,t5_2ruhy

3071125,0,t1_cogadob,So at least the method I was suggesting is basically to prepare your microSD card before you get your nDS.You do have to plug in the full sized SD card from your current DS to your PC. You copy EVERYTHING put it all in a folder on your Desktop so it is easier for you to access. Once that is done plug in the new MicroSD card to your PC and copy everything from that folder you made on the desktop to the new MicroSD card.You then plug in that MicroSD to your current old DS. You will need to use a MicroSD card to SD card adapter. Make sure your games and saves work. If not I would just delete everything that you copied onto your Desktop and microSD card plug in your old SD card again and copy everything again to the PC and copy everything from the PC to the microSD again. The reason I mentioned only to copy is because you want to keep the data on your old SD card intact incase the copy was corrupted or not working.Now whenever you get your nDS and turn it on you must update it. Once the update is complete on both your old and new DS you must go to the System Transfer menu in the Settings app. Make sure you DO NOT create a new NNID on the New DS. Like I said just turn it on update and go to settings and start the system transfer menu.From there do the transfer. Your Source DS is your old DS and the Target DS is the New DS. The transfer option you need to select is the option that says you already have a MicroSD card. The transfer will move your NNID and licences over to the new DS. No save data will be transferred. Once the transfer is done it will tell you to move your MicroSD card to the new DS. Remove the back of the new DS and plug in the MicroSD card into the new DS. When you turn it on you will have ALL your saves and all the games that were on the new DS as well as your NNID streetpass data steps activity log etc.If for example you purchased the Monster Hunter U New Nintendo DS which comes with a preinstalled copy of MHU do not panic. When you do the system transfer the game will disappear after you switch SD cards. That is normal. Just go on the eShop and look at the downloads section which lists all the games linked to your NNID. Monster Hunter U will be there and allow you to download it. I have done one system transfer in the past and I am already ready for my next one once I receive my MMnDS.If you have any more questions just ask me and I dont mind answering them. The system transfer process isnt hard but it is a little confusing for people.,3DS,cogbhtu,10,t5_2ruhy

3076701,0,t1_cogwax6,Yeah its just easier. And if you already have a lot of data on the old SD card like digital games and stuff transferring over PC will be a lot faster than doing the wireless transfer. Its something you can do now before you even get the New DS and when you actually get the new system the whole system transfer will be quick then you just pop the microSD already with all the data into the new handheld. ,3DS,cogwbx7,1,t5_2ruhy

Maybe it was because it wasnt on a portable system maybe it was the underwater bits but for whatever reason the magic wasnt there.

I would recommend you wait a little see the reviews listen to some impressions and most of all see what people think when comparing it back to . That should probably give you the best idea.

We got shipments every week or so on an unfortunately random schedule and of course the cards would never last more than a day if that at least with something like a DS people only buy one with cards there is really no limit to how many your kid will demand you get for them.Anyway to get to the point  of the phone calls we had were about pokemon cards again they represented about  of what we sold and the people on the other end of the phone were sometimes demanding to know when more cards would be in really I have no idea wasnt acceptable to some or otherwise generally rude but sometimes polite and human.

Their customer service told me that the item doesnt ship until Friday meaning I probably wouldnt have gotten it until Tuesday which normally isnt a big deal but Im kind of looking forward to the holiday and having time to mess around with it.

3092953,0,t1_coihtzj,I completely missed the on all fronts distinction.Im totally onboard with wanting there to be a Vita . In the short term a monopoly might mean a glut of fresh content for DS or its successor... but progress will be glacial past that point. However it seems like Sony doesnt really understand what the market wants in portable and Vita was tonedeaf on too many fronts. They clearly werent anticipating PSTV. They are flailing and it doesnt look good. and the portable market has declined as wellI know hindsight is ... but Vita should have had. onboard storage of at least a few GB. all buttons including clickable sticks. It has the depth... no way they couldnt have done it. Remote play was a big selling point!. no rear touch. Kills PSTV and doesnt make sense with the next two parts.... Cheaper memory cards! Surely they could have used microSD and some sort of encryption? Special formatting? ANYTHING???. video out and a dock too. DS support.. Support to stream Netflix at a higher res.Immediately it becomes a portable streaming box and a portable console that you can put on any TV. PS games PSP games and native PSVita games!Sure that all costs... but after you A ditch development costs of G B ditch rear touch C ditch the expensive OLED you might be back in line or even cheaper. OLED was unnecessary and could have been offered later as a midlife upgrade with better OLEDs to boot,3DS,coil07c,2,t5_2ruhy

3112125,0,t3_2vrmrn,From my other post So at my EB games in Canada I go and do a trade in. I had asked previously what to do about the system transfer and they said I could use the mall Wifi and had to do it in store. They did not find out about the refund resell way they were supposed to use until halfway through my transfer when they called head office about someone elses My trade was already run through and complete technically at that point my old system was theirs but they let me use it to do the system transfer. I start it up follow the instructions everything is going smooth two other customers arrive and start their own system transfers.Im on step  of  when the shitty mall Wifi cuts out and interrupts the process. Im not ashamed to admit I cried. It had been close to an hour and a half of transfering already and I didnt want to start it again only to have it cut out. I went up to the employee still sniffling and asked what I could do he offered to hotspot from his phone I explained that would cost him too much data. I offered to pay the  and take it home to do the transfer then Id just take the reduced trade value of  instead simply because that was easier.The manager who is an absolute SAINT! and who was so patient with my crying mess of a self let me take both dses home to complete the transfer on the honor system. I am also a regular though and I work in the mall so they all know where I work and what I look like so it would be easy to hunt me down if I screwed them over.So now Im at home doing the transfer so worried about my wifi cutting out that Im using my phone and data to browse reddit and post this.Addendum Just checked and OMG the battery almost died and I saved it just at the last second. Good lord today has been stressful.,3DS,cokkjz8,1,t5_2ruhy

3172846,0,t1_coquy44,Look at the actual packaging of the product. There is no indicator for NDS LL which is what you are looking for if you want it to work with the NDS XL. Even the title of the ebay listing has no indicator of XL  LL which is a common tag for sellers who are selling the XL  LL version. I also doublechecked the description no indication that it would work with XL  LL.Contact your seller confirm your order if you are not sure. But Ive already canceled an order because I made the same mistake. And id hate for you to wait up to two weeks for an item that doesnt fit your existing new DS XL.If you are still uncertain this is a link straight to Cyber Gadgets web site for the model that works with the NDS XL. Compare the packaging between whats on their site and what you ordered.,3DS,coqv4co,2,t5_2ruhy

3173092,0,t3_2wghp0,Another thing you need to consider with the new design is how the circuit board and everything would have to be set up. With the new cstick possible touch screen enhancements? and everything else some stuff might have had to be moved around so certain things didnt cross paths or get in the way of one another. Especially the power button which is going to be placed in the most efficient spot for it to power the device in regards to the internal setup.Im no expert on electronics or circuitry though so dont credit me on that.As for holding the device personally looking at how you hold it seems really.. awkward. I just hold it with the curve of my hand at the bottom my thumbs for controls my pointer fingers use the LR buttons. The remaining  fingers sit on the back of the bottom half completely hiding my fingers from my view.,3DS,coqw1dp,1,t5_2ruhy

3176050,0,t3_2wily9,Well here was my scenarioI never held a DS XL ever and I upgraded from the regular DS to the New XL and it was pretty amazing with the new screen size and all. I showed it to my friend and he said he doesnt feel like theres any difference whatsoever besides the analog stick. So it felt like I would definitely be missing out if I didnt upgrade but for him not so much.Most importantly it all depends on two things. Do you care about D? If so youre missing out on D being improved significantly.. The lack of an analog stick will make some games a bit more awkward for you maybe? Like in Majoras Mask the ability to turn the camera around is nice but not important. I think those are the only two factors you should consider. Everything else is essentially the same.Edit In short really the New DS XL is not a must have in any situation. For original DS owners Id say its a SHOULD have. For DS XL owners Id say it isnt too necessary unless those two factors I mentioned are very important to you.,3DS,cor734b,1,t5_2ruhy

The retailer isnt going to offer an upgrade to your order because they know the LE will sell out on its own. The LE SKU goes up for sale and whoever grabs it first gets it. There may be rare occasions where youll be upgraded if the retailer screws up big time and and this is a huge and they happen to have some LEs left over but with the way Nintendos been handling their supply chain recently theres not a snowballs chance in hell youll be offered an upgrade to an LE.,3DS,cormdcj,1,t5_2ruhy

3182199,0,t1_cort69u,I wouldnt call X and Y ridiculously easy. The game has probably the best level balancing in any Pokemon game. I skipped over most trainers in ORAS and I still always felt extremely overleveled. Thats the case for most Pokemon games I feel. Level balancing is usually off but in X and Y I always felt like the trainers I was fighting against were on a good enough level and I wasnt overpowered. So I would say X and Y was the most balanced making it the hardest really. As for intense battles like that nothing really feels memorable at the moment. I remember some gym leaders being pretty tough on me. Really though the difficulty of the game depends on the way you play. Dont overlevel yourself and use a team youve never really used before. Its a different way to give yourself a challenge.,3DS,coru1m8,1,t5_2ruhy

I like either interactive story style games like The Last of Us Walking Dead The Wolf Among us Beyond Two souls Heavy Rain Uncharted Valiant Hearts Dear Ester etc. or games that are fun and put a smile on your face like the Mario series Mario Kart Shovel Knight sports games etc.MM just doesnt fit in either category and thats unfortunate since I felt as though the other Zelda games fit into one of these categories and games like ALBW or Minish Cap fit in both.Im just expressing my opinion since everything about this game has been overwhelmingly positive understandably for some and I just want people who share my gaming likesdislikes to be aware.,3DS,coul25b,-1,t5_2ruhy

3226251,0,t1_cowd0ms,I am surprised by how much I am enjoying Rune Factory .  There is just so much content!  It reminds me a lot of Harvest Moon I only played the SNES original which I understand is the genesis of the series but adds in a lot of RPG content.  Like The Elder Scroll series everything you do has a skill and improving skills raises your attributes.  Similar to Skyrim you can get NPCs to join you in questing or you can take the Dragon Quest route and train monsters to fight alongside you.Every game day I get up tend to crops and monsters for moneycrafting materials then speak to the village residents who have something different to say every day and tend to be quite funny.  From here I can go out and fight Zeldalike realtime combat craft and upgrade itemsgear typical xyz fish for moneycrafting go on sidequests or advance the main quest or work on one of the sidefarms I have available if I want to spend more time on cropping.  Essentially I am pretty free to play the game however I want.  Each day only takes a short space of time to play out I think around  minutes so it is my goto game for short sessions.,3DS,cowellt,2,t5_2ruhy

Even though I could I am not even going to get one until April for Xenoblade since I dont feel particularly motivated to go through the effort to score one so soon not least because I am not especially interested in either of the colors but I am hoping Nintendo announces a new regular color shortly even if its just the everywhereelsebuthere metallic blue.Ultimately if it was that important to you you could have waited until they came back in stock online as thats where the majority of stock ends up anyway. Currently both Best Buy and Walmart have both units available on their websites for shipping right now so had you waited just a bit you would have been able to save yourself some effort and frustration.

3252860,0,t1_coz55yy,FLs combat is hit or miss you can dodge a lot of the attacks but the combat is very simplistic and some classes are just not very interesting to play as such as the Hunter. In theory the Hunter is supposed to be using his status effect arrows to hinder enemies in practice using all but one of them is basically pointless and the fastest way to do damage is just to spam your primary combo.Ive said it elsewhere in this thread but I believe that Rune Factory  is just the better life simdungeon crawler.

3253104,0,t1_coz21eq,I really enjoy the genre and still think the complaints about BD are well warranted.  From what Ive read most people that complain about it still have praise about the game as well.  BD just very clearly has excessive padding if you consider the fact that the original Japanese game didnt even have a random encounter option or could even speed up battles.  I would say this is the case even if you took away the optional sections of the game.  Any RPG is judged as a full package not just the main story.I still think its a good game overall even if they couldve toned it down a couple chapters.  Even with its drawbacks I did  the journal which took me greater than  hours one playthrough and  semiplaythroughs so I did still have fun with it.  I just hope they make improvements with Bravely Second.,3DS,coz707g,1,t5_2ruhy

3359443,0,t3_2ynihf, There have been conflicting reports regarding the sturdiness of hinges on the NDSXL. Some insist the black ones have a bit of sidetoside wiggle. My red NDSXLs hinge is nice and snug though. Bear in mind there will always be a little looseness when your device is fully open thats there to keep the hinge from cracking! I dont have a WiiU so i cant speak to this but i know there are certain crossplay games out there like OlliOlli. You could wait and get lucky enough to find a discounted bundle but I wouldnt hold my breath. Expect to pay a significant markup on pretty much any special edition Nintendo handheld. Also some NDSXL bundles packin games are installed on the systems microSD card. I know this to be true for the MHU bundle Im not sure about the Majoras Mask edition. Id get XY over ORAS because I already played RBY. Thats up to you though.Monster Hunter  Ultimates superfun and dangerously addictive and the DS is loaded with other RPGs that are worth a look like Bravely Default. Zelda A Link Between Worlds is the most original Zelda on DS but if youre into Ocarina or MM these are their best versions ever.Every gamers different but from where Im sitting the NDSXL outclasses every other device in the category.

I want to backup my sysNAND incase anything happens in the future. Do I need a gateway card to do this? Also you mentioned a  launcher.dat file. Where do I get the latest version of this file that corresponds with my firmware? I checked the gateway website itself but was confused as there is an Ultra and Omega version.Thanks in advance.EDIT Also I dont really care for the gateway stuff right now just wanted emuNAND running so I can keep my sysNAND in case I ever decide to get a gateway.,3DS,cpdclpp,1,t5_2ruhy

3400249,0,t3_2z5f2h,If youre only looking to buy from Best Buy make sure you price match for the charger. Thatll save you . Still thats a  dollar difference between old DS XL also price matched at  vs new DS XL plus charger . It sounds like Im in the minority but I think the super stable D and cstick camera control make it worth the extra . D is amazing the experience with that and  camera control is so much nicer especially for gyroscopic aiming and controlling where you land as a Deku. If its the only game youll ever get then its a tough call. For me if a game is that great that Id buy a console just to play it then I want to play it in the best way possible. You wont miss them if youve never used them but stable D and camera control are great addons. ,3DS,cpfurhh,7,t5_2ruhy

3413649,0,t3_2zbahc,. I went with a HORI screen protector and it has been by far the best screen protector Ive ever bought. It was amazingly easy and intuitive to apply and I didnt get any bubbles. Im not one to get a screen protector but once I had that screen scratching problem on my old XL I had to go with one especially since I got a Majoras Mask edition. . I think people like them since they are a good case and are clear so they can show of their collector editions or customize them. They are thinner than the larger cases. I dont use them just because I bought the charging cradle and dont feel like removing it every time I charge my system.. The CitySlicker case is expensive but amazing. I went with a nice pouch I found at toysrus. It has a Velcro flap and a second pouch that holds all my games and AR cards. When it comes to cases it is your personal choice.

3528124,0,t1_cptm7v0,Nintendos stance on authenticity is flimsy sometimes theyll go the extra mile like with the GB emulation on DS which even emulates LCD ghosting and other times they seem to just not care.Donkey Kong  for instance this game was the flagship title for the Super Gameboy and it looked amazing. Yet when it came to the VC it was back to greyscale.Not to mention the myriad of technical issues and nonsensical decisionsThe Wii U VC for instance high input lag worse than the original Wii and Wii U NES VC games have muddied visuals unless you set your system to p .gt Nintendo are giving us hz DKC hz DKC and hz DKC. Nothing they are doing makes any sense therefore they must be throwing darts at a wall. Its infuriating and quite frankly insane.The DKC games on Wii U run at seemingly random framerates and in the Hz of DKC it impacts playability as every th frame is repeated resulting in any inputs on the th frame being dropped which can mean death in a game like that.Dont even get me started on their ridiculous PAL region policies of still providing the gimped PAL versions of most games except for when they dont feel like it in which case Hz is fine.PC emulators might have a few issues here and there but they deliver on the thing that actually matters crisp clean Hz gameplay. This is why Im glad Nintendo seems to be getting M to do their emulators now those guys know how to make an emulator it is just a pity that the games with shitty emulators are probably stuck with them.,3DS,cpufi6f,2,t5_2ruhy

3573113,0,t3_319ebl,gt I will notice while doing the flying missions that I get really close to dying but when I take on mini bosses or even the levels boss I find they are MUCH easier to beat. Simply the games standard baddies tend to take much more ammo and time and end up wiping way more of my health than the bosses. thats due to the weapon youre choosing to use. Different weapon have different effectiveness in of airground combat. If you have more issues with ground combat choose a weapon thats better for it at the expense of air combat or vice versa. Thats why there are so many different weapon types.gtWhat if I was doing just fine but got hit by a Orne accidentally?Then you are not doing fine. If you cant guarantee success against them avoid them. They can either be skipped or will disappear after you killed everyone else in the room. gtSuddenly the game thinks I should have the difficulty taken down? No. I just want to start back where I was at the same freakin difficulty and try again. why should you be allowed to? Whats the justification here other than you want to? The whole point of the system is for you to complete a difficulty WITHOUT dying to get the loot for that difficulty. Its a design choice. The developers feels the game should actually be a challenge not a game why you can just try again and again till you get lucky. You can dislike the design choice but you shouldnt get nything more or less than what the game designers designed. ,3DS,cpzk9ly,7,t5_2ruhy

3626466,0,t1_cq5n0ld,Yes.depends on the game. Certain games have an extra validation that is saved on the system memory to prevent cheating examples pokemon animal crossing etc. Those games will only use the most recent save so be careful with those. Do not try to open any files folders are okay on the computer as that might corrupt the save. This is because it uses the date open as the extra validation.Honestly its better to use the save backup feature in the settings to have multiple save files for a game rather than keeping track of it on the computer. This is because all the data on the SD card is encrypted so itll be difficult to know which file is for which save.

It is aimed at high bit rate video recording or other applications that require a high sustained write speed. Sandisk has more of an entry level UHS level card that is cheaper and is still way better than what the DS needs. The Ultra series is what you should get.  for a GB UHS rated card on Amazon right now frequently goes on sale too. Just got one for  last week and it works fine in my DS.

Thats pretty awesome.Yeah my DS was . but I downgraded to . the recent gateway update lets you do that then I installed emuNAND and updated that to .. The emulated firmware is called emuNAND the systems actual firmware is called sysNAND.Alls done with the gateway card. I can link you do this video to show you how its done itll make things more clear. . will be supported eventually it will just take sometime since this update is preparation for the Badge Shop. . was supported within hours of its release so worrying about support shouldnt really be a concern. Anyway not being on the latest firmware isnt that big of a deal since  you can download updates from sites I can message you the one I use and just install them manually. For example Im on . but once ssbs update is out there all I need to do is download and install it along with the mewtwo DLC and Ill be able to play online. Only thing I cant do since Im not on the latest firmware is update content directly from my DS and access the eshop. Everything else works.,3DS,cqd4npa,-2,t5_2ruhy

3835847,0,t1_cqtftwy,Well...appears that  MSRP is going to be a thing now. And if not then  MSRP with some really important DLC is certainly a thing. Even Fire Emblem put all the best stuff behind a paywall. I agree with everything  you said about the story and Ill add that the writer must be some kind of part time or amateur comedian and he was enjoying himself too much and went overboard. But the writing was clever enough that Im okay with that. Ive played this game for  hours. I know all its strengths and weaknesses. In general the story gets too much hate while the actual gameplay weaknesses get glossed over. But damn this game had me addicted like no other.,3DS,cqtiqao,1,t5_2ruhy
3835985,0,t1_cqthhf1,Not particularly no. I played through the entire game only really disliking a few chapters towards the end of the game. The story was alright as I was playing it but looking back its really not as good the stories in the Final Fantasy games Ive played. The way they did cutscenes in BD felt really lazy too. Most cutscenes just have the characters talking and doing gestures in the foreground with the current area in the background as opposed to actually having them in the environments during the cutscenes. If you havent played many FF games before BD might be a good introduction to the series because it has some game options like autobattle and being able to change encounter rates that make the game less of a hassle to play. I think itd be better for you to get one of the GBA FF ports IV V and VI are great or Final Fantasy IVs DS remake. Final Fantasy III is also on the DS but I wouldnt say its that much better than Bravely Default. If these seem too expensive to you they might cost a lot since theyre out of print they also ported these games to iOS.,3DS,cqtjame,1,t5_2ruhy

3844659,0,t1_cqucif4,I disagree. The title told me that much. A demo should show off some gameplay features that distinguish it.

3958542,0,t3_35pqb9,Im cool with going a game or two without weapon durability. Its been done before and can allow for the devs focus the experience on the maps and enemy placements turning it into a bit of a puzzle game. With that being said I disagree that weapon durability was ever tedious. It was a tradeoff. If you hoarded your items that was on you. Most of those games gave you some OP unit for the last level in case you completely messed up but that rarely happened. Like your prepromoted Paladin using the good weapons as needed added in a planning element. It was a saving grace but is not intended to be used to breeze through the game. ITT with  upvotes Playing the game is too inconvenient. Edit Though I do think Awakening showed a good example of a game that didnt really need weapon durability. With an open world map and infinite grinding it takes a bit longer to get to the good stuff. Weapon Durability should probably be reserved for games that fit the older FE style. LSS Hoshido go for it. Nohr meh either way. ,3DS,cr7ia29,1,t5_2ruhy

Only edge Id really give ORAS is that they have more mega stones and move tutors but I use Pokemon Showdown for competitive battling so main games are more about the adventure to me and OP Id imagine and Id say XY wins in that regard.

4097394,0,t3_37jy35,I have a European DS and I would say that if you really want to get one do not rely on the regionFOUR exploit. Youll have to not update your system and even then some games dont work with it. Majoras Mask is an example that doesnt work with the exploit. Its easily patchable by Nintendo. As for if region lock will be removed highly unlikely for the DS. Theres too many issues Nintendo would have to go through with past games and future titles. My guess is they rather focus on making the NX region free and thats basically what they told us as well so far. Anyways the regular size New DS is great I love it so far but if there is ever a chance where the exploit stops working be ready to buy European games. Also to add if you ever need support from Nintendo of Europe ex. warranty issues as far as I know they will not service the device outside of Europe. ,3DS,crnbu5h,1,t5_2ruhy

Talk to villagers and help them out or get to know them write them letters play hide and seek try to get the ugly villagers kicked out.Want to be creative? Make some patterns decorate your town make paths put together outfits etc. Thats not even including stuff like holidays flower breeding tortimer island minigames online multiplayer visiting minigames trading playing the stalk market and most important of all relaxing and taking in your town and villagers.Most people tend to fall into a daily grind of fossils shopping talking to villagers and maybe some bug hunting for money but these games are really easy to get lost in. Just find something you like and dive in  Also its meant to be taken slow in fact the game starts you off slowly and you cant have most of the biggest features until a few days pass and you upgrade your house tortimer island so just enjoy the ride.,3DS,cs9i57e,8,t5_2ruhy

However very few of those reviewers could stand up to a major publisher if they decided to give them legal trouble over it and would almost certainly rather just get rid of the video.Fan translations though do not apply. Theyre essentially giving the game away for free in some instances and taking away a publishers ability to profit off their product in this market if they choose to release it eventually.

4428480,0,t1_csotpob,Its a bit odd how it works making it kind of hard to tell what constitutes a game purchased. Playing the game from the beginning you get introduced to both countries and the path diverges at chapter . You can buy a physical copy which has one path in it already or buy the downloadable version from the eshop which does NOT have a version preselected but rather asks you which path you want to choose in chapter  after which your system downloads that paths content for no additional charge. Each of these options cost  yen.THEN I havent gotten this far supposedly you can pay a discounted amount to get the other path and play that costing  yen. This isnt an ENTIRE game but its a fairly large amount of DLC which Im sure some people will get.Then theres an EXTRA third path you can choose thats going to be available as DLC later. And I dont think theyve released the pricing for that yet. But if you got the special edition that already pays for all of it in advance Including the third path some places are consider that to be  games because of how expensive it would be.,3DS,csowf6n,12,t5_2ruhy

Fingers crossed.That said I have an old regular DS I dont use anymore Im tempted to trade it in for the NDS. I wonder  how long is the return policy? If I kept the NDS unopened until the blue one comes out in a few weeks would I be able to to do an even exchange for the new color?

So they should just let  players switch between  Links.Every thread I see about this game on Reddit and other sites have same comments I was looking forward to playing this with my SOfriendbrother but I guess well skip this game or something to that degree.Im lucky in that I have  friends who are Zelda fans and own a DS so I just need to buy a copy to play with them but a lot of other people dont have that.Hell the guy in the interview is literally telling the guy with a wife to go find a rd wheel to play with them.,3DS,ct9655g,10,t5_2ruhy

If you format the old system and trade it in without doing a system transfer you will have to open a support case with Nintendo to move your Nintendo ID over to the new DS. Let me know if you have any questions  also use the search bar as this is something thats been discussed what seems like hundreds of times since the NDS came out.

What I did was use it as an opportunity to train up a larger team I kept swapping in and out kept them at reasonable levels. In previous games if I tried that it would have been more difficult because I would have to grind all the new members individually while now I can train up entire teams by having a single higher level guy with me. Use the system however you see fit I suppose. It gives you more opportunity to get overleveled but you can choose how or even if you use it.

4763186,0,t3_3g2a5w,I will play Kid Icarus Uprising i got from club nintendo. Will report back!editSo here i am. I started it and had some problems with the control. I use a DS XL with CPP because i got so used to it for Monster Hunter that it feels weird to play the Ds without the CPP. And it sucks to play Kid Icarus with it. But ok i put on a table and held my Ds awkwardly.It is sort of fun reminds me of a bullet hell. The character is not exactly charismatic and i had no idea what was happening since it mostly threw me into action.Aiming is really bad with the touch screen.Next stage i am on land and god damit the controls got worse. I walked around shooting things and doing kind of a dash to dodge. hour is up and i deleted the game this is definately not for me. ,3DS,ctuxzzz,3,t5_2ruhy

4776914,0,t1_ctwd7lc,Yes Ive played Steamworld Dig as well.To be honest both games feel very different. When I asked the developers about this they told me something along the lines of Were in love with the Steamworld universe and were trying to challenge ourselves to make a lot of different types of games within it.And thats very true. With Steamworld Tower Defense Steamworld Dig and now a turnbased strategy kind of game its hard to compare the entries in the Steamworld series as theyre all very different. Sure the art style is still the same and theres still leveling up as well but aside from that the games are very different. Im not sure which one is my favorite either both games are just really good in my opinion. Well see if this changes once the full game comes out.,3DS,ctwo7cx,3,t5_2ruhy

4847976,0,t3_3h9nx3,The best Castlevania games were the Igarashi games. He was the producer that took over the series with Symphony of the Night. Pretty much every metroidvania that came out during his time with Konami is amazing. The best in my opinion was the Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow series. The first one was on the GBA and has been released onto the Wii U eShop while the second one is a DS game and sequel to the first. You dont absolutely need to play the first game to get the second game but Id recommend playing it anyway. Id avoid anything older than Symphony of the Night until youre more use to the series and the Metrodivanias. They are very different and the older ones are very much for the more hardcore gamer. The metroidvania style games do have quite a bit of backtracking but its not really a problem especially on the DS games where you usually have the map always visible. Its also very satisfying going back to earlier areas and finding new secrets new weapons skills etc. Plus theres usually teleporting to get around the castle faster. Avoid the Lords of Shadow series. Theyre hot garbage. Theyre Konamis misguided attempt at making Castlevania more popular and accessible by copying the God of War style. Konami pretty much killed Castlevania with that series and its no surprise that theyve pretty much got out of the home and handheld gaming business in favor of focusing on gambling and phone games. So in my opinion the best games are  Aria of Sorrow  Dawn of Sorrow Order of Ecclesia Symphony of the Night Circle of the Moon not an Igarashi produced game but still very good Portrait of Ruin Harmony of DissonanceHe also worked on Rondo of Blood the game that came before Symphony of the Night and which Symphony picks up pretty much immediately after. Its a good game but is more of an original style Castlevania than a metroidvania style. Konami put out remade version for it on the PSP and the Playstation Network. It also includes a version of Symphony of the Night but with a changed script so its not as hilarious. If you get into the series and have a PSP or Vita I recommend giving it a shot. ,3DS,cu5mglh,2,t5_2ruhy

4953019,0,t1_cui4b8i,. Being playable in chunks is one of the aspects Ive most enjoyed. Quests are time capped to min often taking about half that so it gives you a great stopping point either for pick up and play gaming or a you should go outside for a bit reminder. Im hrs into the game but it still feels fresh and light similar to ACNL instead of the marathon eye bleeding grind that I usually fall into with RPGs looking at you SkyrimMass Effectetc.. I play coop with my girlfriend. Its a lot of fun if shes also into it but its not a game you can easily drag your friends into playing. Ie. a lot of people will pick up and play a game of MK or Smash even if they dont regularly play it or if its not their favorite title but that doesnt easily happen with MH. Guild quests are very well balanced for two players and you each get to bring one of your palicos along customizing palicos is way more fun than it should be.... You could try out the demo coop with her and see what you two think though fair warning we both hated the demo and didnt find it representative of the full game I think because it doesnt provide any context or nice entry curve and this was our first MH.,3DS,cuiv9ie,1,t5_2ruhy

5005275,0,t3_3jh2t3,I picked up Alpha Sapphire about a month ago. Its been a great game Ive logged  hours in it so far and I like some of the features they added especially the PokeNav. I havent tried any of the online battling yet but online trading section is very active. I havent had any trouble finding people willing to trade for Pokemon that arent featured in the AS game.There is also a lot of postgame content to get through in my opinion. Beating the Elite  unlocks the National Pokedex and allows you to find more Pokemon. It also unlocks the ability to capture legendary Pokemon. Islands Mirage locations will appear at different times throughout the day and street passes will unlock more Mirage islands. If you enjoy the aspect of finding and capturing Pokemon then youll have lots to do.,3DS,cupbo33,3,t5_2ruhy

5025306,0,t1_curpg3b,how did you you feel about wind waker? Ocarina of time is going to be closer to that and is my favorite game in the series. if you liked windwaker go with that! its an absolutely fantastic game and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time look up any askreddit thread asking what game is the greatest or a masterpiece ocarina will be in the top ten. plus if you like it the game leads into majoras mask also available for dsa link between worlds is an awesomely done game. while the others are remakes of n games this game was built for the ds system. it looks wonderful and the d works great. this game is an homage to the original snes game a link to the past. however it is not a remake. it shares similarities with it in terms of map and characters and some things like that but thats as far as it goes. its a great game if you dont care about nostalgia with the series which wouldnt matter as much to you. the concept is wonderful and you merge from d to d seamlessly as part of the mechanic. it takes real problem solving to figure out at timesa hallmark of all zelda games and this keeps the game compelling when dungeon crawling trough different stages. it is a top down game camera where as the others give you a view of the character from behind. meaning this one to me feels more like a handheld game whereas the others feel like you are playing on a system like windwakeri would stick by this if you liked windwaker the music the mechanics the gameplay etc go with ocarina. otherwise a link between worlds might be more up your alley. here is a good dunkview summary,3DS,curqod2,1,t5_2ruhy

5151199,0,t3_3lk42v,This is a great move on Nintendos part if they were even involved with the decision IMO. Rather than resort to NDS exclusivity just remove features from the game if its being played on older systems. It encourages people to upgrade but doesnt lock them out.  Related I really wish people on this sub werent so quick to tell people they dont need to upgrade. We get it  you dont want to or cant buy a NDS yet and your old DS or DSXL is working just fine for you so you tell people not to worry about it. But come on... for the folks who dont have one yet the NEW DS is obviously the only version that you should consider if you want to be able to play  of DS games the way they were intended to be played. DS is a halfdecent option if you absolutely cant spend any more than  or whatever but it is the absolutely bottomtier budget option. But for anything else you should spring for the NDS or NDSXL. The DS family is in its twilight years and this is clearly the last version of the system. Why buy an outdated model at this point? ,3DS,cv6wv06,288,t5_2ruhy

5165811,0,t3_3lqn3i,Definitely do not have to answer this but I am curious. I really would like a new game for my ds. I have owned one since the beginning and I play it pretty consistently about once a year. So far I ownplayed fire emblem awakening OoT Link between worlds and Monster Hunter . Aside from a Link between worlds I have yet to exhaust the other games but I am getting close and I would like to see something new. Are there games that every ds owner should own? Any highly recommended by you guys?I am not terribly picky when it comes to genre of a game as long is it is fun and engaging. I will say that a good amount of the anime story lines such as Fire emblem can make me cringe from time to time and dont necessarily catch my attention. Great game play in that game though. I also love smash bros but I would prefer something that you can progress through and complete in a way.Tldr Are there games every ds owner should play?

5176870,0,t3_3lwte8,The factory reset and disassociation of the shop account are more than sufficient. Everything on the SD card except picsvideos which would be deleted with the reset  is encrypted anyway. If you are ultra paranoid that someone will buy your ds and attempt to recover the deleted and encrypted data then attempt to break the encryption...just keep the sd cardswap in a blank but I wouldnt feel that is needed. The chances of someone spending hoursdaysweeksmonths trying to potentially recover some data that they would also then have to break the encryption on that might allow them to perform petty credit fraud is highly unlikely. Itd be far easier and more fruitful to steal your garbage do a bit of social engineering or sniffing wifi traffic for a few minuteshours than it is to go through the hassle of buying your ds and doing all the extra work.edit whoops misspoke about picsvideos ,3DS,cva043q,2,t5_2ruhy

5207386,0,t1_cvdo71t,If you have not yet installed any entrypoints and have never used Homebrew Launcher before this will cover ALL the steps required Install YouTube from the DS eShop. Grab the homebrew starter kit from Smeals website and extract it to your SD cards root folder making sure boot.dsx is not in any subfolders. Download the themehaxinstaller from the releases page of the github. Extract it onto your SD card ensuring that the ds folder in the zip file merges with the ds folder on the root of your SD card. Open System Settings on your DS. Take note of what firmware your DS is on. It is that string of numbers in the bottom righthand corner of the top screen. Go into internet settings. You need an existing connection set up. Choose one this is going to be the connection you use to activate the Homebrew. Change the settings of the connection specifically the DNS settings. Turn autoobtain DNS off and instead enter ... into the primary DNS key. Ignore the secondary. Save the settings and exit back to home menu. Run YouTube while connected to the network you just modified the settings of. You should be redirected to a version selection screen. Choose the version that correctly matches your DS type and firmware the number you took note of in step . Homebrew Launcher will open after a couple ugly OS screens. Congratulations youve successfully installed Tubehax. Now to install the more convenient homemenuhax theres a couple more steps. Find themehaxinstaller on the list of software that show up in the Homebrew Launcher list and open it. Press A to confirm the installation once the black screen with white text shows up. The installer may need to download the files from the internet. Once it is installed press start to return to the Homebrew Menu and then start again to return to the DS home menu. This is just an optional step to disable Tubehax but its required if you want to use YouTube for videos or you want to access the eShop or download DS updates as these are disabled for resource reasons. Do note that downloading firmware updates will almost definitely break the Homebrew Exploit and youll need to update the entrypoint in order to use it again. But for now... Open System Settings again navigate to connection settings open the connection you previously modified and simply turn autoobtain DNS back on. You do not need to clear the numbers you entered previously. Now whenever you boot your DS you can launch into Homebrew mode instead by holding L before the DS starts up.,3DS,cvdokfr,39,t5_2ruhy

5465568,0,t3_3pvdrt,Two of my friends and I met up this morning to buy the game. We played  hours. First the three of us for  hours and then two of us with strangers online. For completely local multilayer I have to say this is a legit  amazing Nintendo game. I really wish my friend didnt have to leave. So when he left we tried replaying a regular level with a stranger and it was pretty terrible. He was pretty stupid and just had no clue what to do. You cant communicate basic Zelda knowledge with come here Noooooo and cheering. So I can definitely see where some of those reviews come from.Then we played some bonus challenges which are available once youve beaten an area before. And those were okay since we all kind of had an idea of what to do yet. In the end we even were joined by someone who seemed like he had had the game for much longer than us he was really good and we were kind of slowing him down. I still have to try single player or multiplayer with two complete strangers but I do expect them to be terrible. In singleplayer youll have to constantly have to switch between the characters which will definite feel very slow and Im not sure if all of the levels are even playable like that... And seeing how frustrating just one player you couldnt talk to was two must be unbearable. ,3DS,cwaa0o5,2,t5_2ruhy

5471076,0,t3_3q09xg,Everyone you know are assholes because you just so happen to have different tastes.Lets be real here and this is coming from someone who things its the best game ever oot is nothing new. In fact the game and its story is so astoundingly simple that anyone could get through it if they played it long enough.  If this game was released in todays world it would be considered meh still good but a same old same old game.  It truely has no really unique features anymore.The whole reason its considered so great is the time it came out in. dgames were still really new and oot basically set the foundation for the typical adventure game. Not to mention every single d Zelda after it. But it really doesnt age that well its still a great game to most people but its an aged one. Camera is a little wonky and controls can sometimes feel weird. And since it was what helped lay down the fundamentals of d Zelda thats all it REALLY  is. A very basic Zelda game.Plus the whole nostalgia thing as well as younger kids jumping on the oh everyone else says it bandwagon.If you dont like it dont sweat it theres going to be games you like and everyone hates and vice versa thats just what makes everyone different,3DS,cwazc9y,2,t5_2ruhy
5476205,0,t3_3pxkpx,Thanks for this post I want to like Yokai Watch but I have mixed feelings about what Ive seen so far. Can you tell me about how evolution works with the Yokai? Is there a level cap? Do you have to breed Yokai to get more powerful ones?I ask because Ive played some other monster battle games like Dragon Warrior Monsters or Digimon World where you had to basically destroy the parent monsters to get a new level  monster and the ones you caught in the wild would get capped at level  or stuff like this.,3DS,cwbmxbw,1,t5_2ruhy

You can even ditch the phone charger and get one of those  port USB chargers from Anker Aukey or ChoeTech to be even more efficient. If you have a recent Android phone I definitely recommend getting a charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge . on at least one port.I dont really have a case recommendation but anything you buy would benefit from you reducing the chargercable bulk.

5654560,0,t3_3skbfp,R is a generic flashcartridge name. You must be more specific.For DS ROMs the most common flashcarts that are  guaranteed to work on latest firmware on a ODSNDS are Ri Gold plays games exactly like the games would play from a retail cartridge. This means no emulation or extra features like save states Supercard DSTwo Has an onboard CPU for emulation and extra features like save states Supercard DSTwo Plus a more recent version which also supports DS ROMs. However the DS ROMs only work when you are below . firmwareFor DS ROMs there is only one flashcartridge that works on latest firmware  SkyDS works with all games that were released before animal crossing happy home designer. However it doesnt work with games released after that because Nintendo implemented new antipiracy on their latest games.If you are below . firmware you have these optioms for DS ROMs Custom Firmwares CFWs. They are free and does pretty much everything as the flashcarts. Gateway Ultra pretty much just a convenience thing when compared to CFWs Supercard DSTwo Plus the most convenient option since it supports DS ROMs too.THERE IS NO RISK OF USING THE FLASHCARTS. You will only brick your system when you are making changes to NAND something you cant do if you arent below . firmware.THERE IS NO RISK OF GETTING BANNED EITHER WHEN PLAYING OFFLINE Online is safe too when you inject private headers to the ROMs.,3DS,cwy04rq,11,t5_2ruhy

So youll have allotted   whatever you had before you started practice mode.  practice badges is  free plays  is   is .

Its one of my favorite games and Ive got over  hours logged on Steam with it. But about the devs being dicks this is something Ive heard from other people but also experienced first hand. Back before the game got as big as it was today I posted some suggestions for it on their forums. The mods stickied the post it got a ton of likes and positive feedback from the community and even one of the devs Tiy the art guy said hed show it to the developers.Pretty much every single one of my ideas made it into the game without even a word of thanks. I mean I didnt expect to get money or credit or anything but just a simple thanks would have been nice since it seemed pretty obvious they used all my ideas in future updates. Heres the post. Keep in mind none of this stuff existed in the game at the time of my writing and now all of it does.

Itll be harder than console but its still doable and probably desirable to them. The PC userbase has also been changing over the last few years. There is an increase in console gamers who have already been conditioned to pay for online and are now switching to PC.

6035281,0,t1_cyaieg7,Granted removing region unlocking is likely to mess up DLC from servers and shops but this scenario is only likely to happen after the console is out of support. Remember the firmware sits below the software and will present itself to the game as whatever region it would need to run. Software shouldnt need patching in that scenario. Its the firmware locking out the hardware to run the game not the other way around. Once booted into the correct region there would never be a need for storing x times as many addresses used by regionspecific things. ,3DS,cyaqnhh,1,t5_2ruhy

The swinging mechanics allow you to get some good speed once you get good at it. Cave Story on the ds eshop is pretty good but I believe that japan just had the  version released so Id recommend waiting on that one or going for it on steam. Speaking of PC if you really dont mind trying another platform I recommend Dustforce the mechanics are very interesting and have a lot of depth most maps have very different ways to be completed art style is wonderful runs good on everything Im getting consistent  framerate on my shitty laptop without having to change anything and dont get me started on the soundtrack.  ,3DS,cybzld8,4,t5_2ruhy

6065970,0,t3_3yeq9g,Absolutely. One thing I hated about the DS was the overuse of the touch screen. I get that certain games can benefit from touch screen controls but lets be real here. Those games are far and few between. What the DS did was take the innovations of the DS and implemented them with the tried and true gameplay of the GBA to make one awesome handheld. The touch screen mostly functions as a menu or map while the gameplay is almost entirely on the top screen. I loved that they took this route as I hated having gameplay on the bottom screen while trying to touch over as well. Sure the DS doesnt have as many games as the DS or even the GBA but theres also a lot less shovelware. I dont think the DS is perfect as theres always room for improvement but I think the DS was the step in the right direction.,3DS,cyeqo6c,1,t5_2ruhy

6146174,0,t1_cynyyr4,ACNL isnt about completion other than maybe filling the museumaquarium and leveling up the shops to their best. You just improve your town over time and try and design your house and fishcatch bugsdig fossils. Its really casual. The things that are limited are things like christmas home decorations or new years stuff etc. You get a bonus on your home design score if you have seasonal items in it. You can also try and get complete sets of furniture. These come and go and the store only holds like  pieces of furniture at a time and afaik they are pretty random in what they have you will probably rely on other people visiting your town via streetpass to complete them. I find that if you get obsessed with getting every thing then you cant put the game down for fear of missing that one chance encounter. There is nothing unavailable in the game that would somehow prevent you from continuing or from getting max points on your house or anything.I also really like SMT IV. It is really dungeon based and is completely different to AC NL in just about every way possible. I havent got very far at all and I am  hours in because I like just grinding to level up and fuse demons to create new ones. I can see it taking ages.,3DS,cyo97d7,1,t5_2ruhy

Here it is on my DS...Edit just to clarify. Its only worth it if you really really have nostalgic value for Dragons Lair and would love to have it on the DS.

From the sound of it theyre just adapting the game to the market.I was explaining yes what they are doing is literally the definition of censorship. They think for whatever reason the western market will find this particular gameplay mechanic offensive and unacceptable so they cut it out.

Sure it lacks a lot of the unique characters but the core gameplay is probably the best in the series. The speedup is much appreciated and the optional tutorials are awesome compared to MampL shoving them down your throat until the final boss.The toad hunts arent even that bad I actually enjoyed them a lot because they changed it up almost every time.

6536020,0,t3_44zkie,Its quite simple If you buy Birthright you get the Birthright path but you also have the option of buying Conquest as DLC with a less price and later the third route Revelation which is included on the special edition but wont be released until... march maybe?BUT as they share the same storyline from its start to chapter  you can actually buy the physical version of both Conquest and Birthright. I mean the option of choose isnt important at all because it doesnt change the story itself. It only allows you to choose which game you want to play did you get the point?.  So it doesnt matter if you buy both versions physically or for example only the physical version of Conquest  and then the digital version of Birthright when you reach chapter .In fact you arent choosing between two paths but you are buying the two games just with one difference the price.  Buying it as DLC costs  instead of  plus Revelation that are  more. Then youll pay a total of  for the three routes.  If you buy the physical version of both youll pay  for each one plus the  of Revelation. A total of . The special edition costs  and brigs the  routes plus the artbook. Then the GAME itself costs the same buying the special edition or buying first one version and then the dlcs. In my case I have been saving money for the special edition but if I had not saving it  Id buy the physical version of both games since Fire Emblem is one of my favourites sagas even knowing that im losing money.  ,3DS,czvdkwt,4,t5_2ruhy

6555166,0,t3_45esv8,I just set one up using a raspberry pi.    I bought the cana kit  It had everything I needed.I followed the instructions on this site here   There is no monitor or anything else need.Basically you put the raspberry pi in the case optional flash the software on the microSD card free tool linked on the site you put the wireless usb device in the top right usb port you but the microSD card in plug an ethernet cord to it from your router and plug in the power adapter.It creates an ATampT wireless network that will be open.  You can lock  it down via mac address.  If you connect to the ATampT wireless network you can access the config pages via a web browser.  If you want some security on it you can lock it down by mac address remember to add a PClaptop before locking it down to your DS so changes can be made later.It works well out of the box for me so I havent played around too much with it but Ill do my best to answer your questionIt needs a wired connection to the network.  Connecting it to your PC via ethernet will unlikely do that unless you have some special set up.Its a low profile traffic device.  I also connect wirelessly to everything and I havent noticed much slowdown at all.  The only time I had some problems is when I forgot I was on the ATampT SSID and not my normal one.  The wireless network used for spill pass is much slower than the one I have set up for my home use.Yes.  The settings are accessible through a web browser.  Just connect to the ATampT SSID and then go to   Youll get the settings pages.I had no issue setting it up.  It was easy as pi... sorry...,3DS,czxcvp8,1,t5_2ruhy

6616236,0,t1_d03mcjr,Hope you enjoy the game to its fullest. Its one of my favorite games on the DS I actually just started my third playthrough a couple days agoA few tips Start Woodcutter and Miner ASAP! You can use their tools with any life to mine and cut trees and most of their challenges can be completed while using another license. They both have a minefell  orestrees so the sooner you start mining and felling everything on your way the better Learn what the stats improve. It can make a big difference in being able to complete some challenges. On the other hand you can always reset them later in the game so dont stress too much about it. The DLC only unlocks at level  a few things unlock before like a lot more options in character customization but the bulk of it only after lvl . If you enjoy the game buy it. Its really worth it. And also people that dont have the DLC cant play with people that have the DLC Theres a lot of info in rFantasyLife you should check it out at some point Have fun!,3DS,d03obj7,3,t5_2ruhy

If youve ever played Advanced Wars back in the day its like that.If you decide to pick up Fire Emblem game you should get either Birthright the cool new one or Awakening the old one thats still really really good.

6670653,0,t1_d08yf97,I remember glitches like enemy displacement for example if you let an enemy run off the screen then it often disappears completely. Id be OK with keeping that bug since its a software bug and can be used strategically.The only other bug I noticed in these games was the slow down. In MM theres a part in Spark Mans stage where giant cubes of junk fall from the ceiling. But when there was more than one block onscreen the game started lagging severely. Maybe this is naive and correct me if Im wrong but since a more powerful console wouldnt have the slowdown I view it as more of a hardware issue. If thats right then the DS should be able to run it if the game is remastered properly so I think that kind of thing should be fixed.But its a valid point to want the original experience available on DS bugs and other limitations and all.,3DS,d09ax11,2,t5_2ruhy

I enjoyed GoldSilver or HeartGoldSoulSilver on the DS for similar reasons I loved the new at the time breeding system the morningnooneveningnight cycles making Pokeballs out of apricorns seeing a shiny for the first time. You can also explore both the Johto and Kanto region in HGSS.        I found the stories in both the HGSS and ORAS to be the most enjoyable of all the Pokemon games so far and if they were cheaper Id definitely suggest HGSS but you could probably find ORAS for a lot less.,3DS,d0fpfus,1,t5_2ruhy

6736351,0,t1_d0f39oy,But honestly seems pretty cheap design dont get me wrong I love DS games as the Lites design is my favorite handheld of all time but all the handleds I had broke in someway and replacement parts nowadays just sucks yellowed screens in all the cases and ghosting drives me insane is not just a smooth experience as I had it before. I just got a DSi and hell I felt in love with it its the first one I have even tried but the damn handled which was a refurb by Nintendo has the upper screen yellowed and ghosting in the bottom screen lel Cleaned and tested huh Nintendo? Im going to sell it as Ive seen  of the people in worldwide does not care about it. But in a nutshell the system felt so good I liked the design a lot more than my NNDSXL and the larger screen didnt make the games look like crap as the DSI XL did which tbh is not that good looking They got rid of the GBA port of course but I just have many other ways to run those games that I literally dont care PSP NNDSXL or the possibility of buying a DStwo but dont fully trust in its emulation capabilities. ,3DS,d0g3i7s,2,t5_2ruhy

Not all can but many of the tutorials have either links or at least good starting points to find one. You said nonwifi router. Are you referring to the modem itself or do you have a bridge connecting multiple computersconsoles? If you have a bridge then you can pick up the Wifi Repeater and simply use that for Homepass. If you dont have a bridge youll need the USB stick. Or find a openWRTTomato capable router and use that for Homepass disabling the Wifi when not in use.

Its way too late in the WiiU lifecycle for an HD port although if FE keeps doing well I wouldnt say no to it eventually.  Maybe well get a VC release next generation.

But its good that you like Etrian Odyssey because this is basically an Etrian Odyssey game with a Persona mask. Im not saying that to insult the game  I just want you to have the right mindset going into the game so you can get the most enjoyment out of it. Dont go in expecting Persona. Go in expecting Etrian Odyssey and be happy that theres also Persona in there! Next you might want to play Persona  first not just because of all the references and stuff but because the game also features some spoilers. I dont remember if its anything too big but there are spoilers.Regarding Soul Hackers its a fun game but it uses classic SMT series mechanics and is more like Persona  and  and not much like  and . Worth  to try it Id say. Just be aware that it was originally on like the PS and Sega Saturn so its gonna have that oldschool feel and difficulty. SMTIV plays very differently from both Persona and Soul Hackers though they share a lot of themes and some mechanics. SMTIV is my favorite of the three options.,3DS,d0xwuj0,4,t5_2ruhy

7024458,0,t3_4bt7ya,Nobody is talking much about Revelation so Ill throw in some good stuff to know in advance. If you want all of the children and especially if you have a male Corrin or want to marry across nations plan your Srank pairings out before you commit. Its possible to get stuck with a set that disqualifies a parent from marrying. Birthright has this issue as well as a male Corrin can only marry a Corrinsexual like Reina or Scarlet or a second generation character if you want all of the children.        Revelation has some map gimmicks that are very obscure. For example Chapter  requires a stealthbased approach in order to get the best rewards. Its not only extremely difficult to do but the reward is never referenced prior to the end of the chapter and the mechanics by which you complete the objective are never explained. In a nutshell you cant go within range of an enemy unit until you trigger the boss fight. Even if that enemy moves within range of you and even if you blitz the unit from outside of its range. Its very annoying and the reward includes Boots so its not insignificant.         ,3DS,d1ckp2f,2,t5_2ruhy

7076032,0,t3_4ci0no,gtA good number of players disagreed though and I saw a few heated arguments.This always happens when a new game comes out. Theres a rush of people who buy new games and defend it whenever someone makes a criticism until eventually nobody ever talks about the game again. It happened with Tomodachi Life Codename S.T.E.A.M. Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer etc. Hell its happening with Hyrule Warriors Legends right now. Mention the fact that it doesnt look as good as the Wii U version and that there are less enemies on screen at once and youll be downvoted to oblivion. People just want to justify their purchases.Ontopic Borrowed FFE from a friend who bought it on release and gave up on it saying it was too boring. Played some parts myself both online and single player and have to say the single player is too dull to pursue no real story and playing public online wasnt as fun as I thought it would be as youre mainly just spamming the same good attacks you like over and over again.Would probably have been more fun playing with friends online through Skype or something though.,3DS,d1ifkc0,2,t5_2ruhy

7145635,0,t1_d1qazzp,To be honest Ive only used the big Pikachu one so far. Ill put my DS in the other ones and take pictures though!Assuming your Eevee one has the same texture as my Pikachu one the two pictured above feel much cheaper in comparison. Theyre a lot more flexible and rubberyglossy. The best way to describe it would be like the TPU smartphone cases. They are much easier to put on and take off than the molded Pikachu one though. The Gray Pikachu one has a flap that covers the charging port which is pretty nifty but it doesnt seem to be able to get all the way up to the top of the DS. It kind of sits at an angle. Same with the Pikachu party though theres no charging port flap it kind of bubbles up off the surface on the back and doesnt sit completely flush. If I had to choose Id definitely pick the harder Pikachu one over these two though theyve got their own charm and I dont feel like Im about to rip the back plate of my DS when I remove them which is nice.,3DS,d1qdtkk,3,t5_2ruhy

Do either of these traits get annoying or do they try to balance it out in the game?I really hope at least Yew is done well Micheal Sinterniklaas is a great voice actor and I want to be able to enjoy his role as much as I enjoyed James Urbaniak in Codename S.T.E.A.M. .,3DS,d1qrur6,1,t5_2ruhy

Danganronpa is more comparable to Phoenix Wright whereas VLR is more comparable to those escape the room games you may have played before in your life. Completely different in that regard.Overall Id say get it. Ive played through both series including the Danganronpa spinoff and enjoy both equally. Just dont go into it expecting a similar experience to Danganronpa because aside from the whole killing thing theyre completely different in tone gameplay and story.Ninja edit just a quick recommendation to try and play  before VLR.

But just in case you are looking for a solution still I spent a few hours on Sunday looking for a way to do this and eventually found a solution. I havent merged it into master because it is really clunky and ugly and requires an apple script that interacts with the Networking GUI. I think I will leave it in its own separate branch for nowYou may get some warnings asking you to give applescript some permissions to interact with the UI but after that it should run smoothly. I will try to update the Readme soon with some better instructions. ,3DS,d21ougq,2,t5_2ruhy

7380421,0,t1_d2gv5iv,Youd have a great point if they showed some more variety. But thats the problem there really isnt aside from the snow level with the Sheegoth. Everything shown in these videos looks so..generic. Theyre going so slow which Im just hoping is because of the loadout they have for the mission the enemies are kinda blehsave for a few of the other enemies Ive seen and the Pirates which is REALLY saying something since the game is going for this cutesy chibi look. It really highlights how bland the visuals could be in the Metroid Prime main series at times because this feels like Im watching something taking place in the Agon Wastes or Chozo Ruins without anything cool or interesting.But thats just the visuals  The level design feels bland. Why would they show this particular level? the last level they showed had slopes different elevation more environmental objects...the level in this video at times feels like Im watching someone play someones first DOOM level. which wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt fo rthe speed theyre going. This slow pace fits well with the original Metroid Prime trilogy but not something like this!I was giving them the benefit of the doubt when Tanabe said what he said about this. Metroid can survive and probably flourish more if they branch out and have more characters other then Samus. This game has a solid idea but theyre not showing anything interesting. It doesnt matter if no ones played it yet. Nintendo had plenty of time to sell this game show more of that mech system for example. They seriously need to do a massive PR campaign.Also I found a post on Neogaf that explains the delay. Its just a theory but it makes sense to me ,3DS,d2h3qbp,2,t5_2ruhy

7470120,0,t1_d2r8kkg,The redownload from server issue actually has points on both sides of the proscons list.For the near term the fact that digital copies are linked to an NNID means that in the event that a system is lost or stolen it is possible to buy a new system and have Nintendo perform a remote licenseonly system transfer of the NNID onto the new machine.  Any physical games with a lost or stolen machine would be gone for good.But in the longer term your point comes into play.I personally go physical for most things anyway but Im also a looooong time gamer who grew up with physicalonly cartridge systems.  Actually I grew up before game systems at all but the point still stands. But when I do the proscons lists I try to lay them out in an unbiased fashion as the priorities vary wildly from gamer to gamer.,3DS,d2rb2li,1,t5_2ruhy

7653444,0,t1_d3brk8x,A few notes. Ive had to deal with copyright claims on even the smallest background music in the past. Its a cute idea but not if I want to monetize a video. To put it politely even the smallest audio clips risk being a back and forth with YouTube and their Dispute Policy. Just this year Ive dealt with about four copyright claims a month. I also have put out  videos since the beginning of the year. So getting a little more than a dozen claims in that time isnt terrible. Ive won almost every single one of them except for one where I just reedited and removed the section that caused the claim and put the section that caused the claim up on Facebook. Generally a lot of the large channels work with MCNs that handle those annoyances. Generally Im not looking to join an MCN due to wanting to preserve both ownership of my own content and freedom from contractual obligations. Also the channel does a variety of content due to its nature and pedigree. That is currently not possible using the equipment that I have. These are processed and edited with Windows Movie Maker  which doesnt allow for picture in picture or embedded image files. Preferably I would prefer to use captured video footage but thats entirely out of my budget at this point. Eventually Id like to get the channel to a point where further investment in new equipment can be more feasible. Once thats out of the way Ill be remasteringremixing older videos to update their information and presentation style. So the bare bones feel of some of the videos on the channel is more about stretching and using the equipment available as much as possible for as long as possible. Think of it as Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology in a way. The laptop used to convert and edit those videos is about four years old the camera used to record it is about six years old but still good. Yes these could be prettier and thats what an eventual remasterremix of them will accomplish.,3DS,d3c5jqa,-1,t5_2ruhy

I had always been meaning to get into it had tried on like PSP Emulator never get into playing games on Emulators dunno why also tried  briefly on Wii it never stuck.I kinda wanted to play the latest Pokemon since I had not really played since Silver saw the DS thought I dont need D picked it up and didnt get into MHU yet again was slowly playing Pokemon but tried the demo of Fire Emblem Awakening and I was out down the stores the next day picking it up.End of it all MHU hit finally clicked and loved it not long after the NDS hit I picked that up thinking it would be great to play MHU on which it is but I had done most of what I wanted by then so was kinda a future investment for MHGen!tldr Monster Hunter made me WANT a DS just to play the newest one but stuck around due to Fire Emblem and just love the more Japanese games the system has vs my Xbox P,3DS,d3k6nqn,1,t5_2ruhy

A port uses essentially the same logic and code as the original with restructured resources and libraries for referencing the new hardware in which case the port will look and perform almost exactly the same as the original just on different hardware.Youre thinking of remakes which OoT and MM are both examples of but they are not ports.

8046871,0,t3_4pfl1m,gtWhen I played I could more of less spam attacks with no thought. Unless you specifically were grinding excessively I dont see how that is possible.If you were relying on one single Pokemon then eventually youd come up against an opponent that you cant brute force. You end up with weird strategies where you spam powerful attacks and if  your Pokemon faints you just throw out your level  pidgey or something as a sacrifice as you use a max revive.There is also the whole collecting aspect. A lot of my time in ORAS was spent by farming Pokemon by breeding and trading on the GTS as well as evolving them to fill out the pokedex by fighting otherwise harmless blisseys. Probably spent more time acknowledging X grew to level... messages or dealing with learned moves than actually selecting moves overall thinking about it.And there is also the online play aspect but be ready to lose if your strategy is keep using Flamethrower or something.,3DS,d4kjls0,2,t5_2ruhy

8170112,0,t1_d4xru7h,. Its a special edition not a limited edition. Theres a difference. There is no requirement to make a limited number of copies of a special edition. In this case the special factor that was important to most fans was the ability to have all  games on one cart. If this was available outside of the special edition I dont think people would have been nearly as upset about the whole situation.. These days preorders for special editions or even limited editions should enable companies to print enough copies to meet demand. Which is what most publishers do. Nintendo does not seem to understand this concept and instead limited the number of preorders.I managed to eventually snag a copy of the SE for myself. But it took a lot of effort. I didnt appreciate having to go through that at the time and I still havent forgiven Nintendo for putting its fans through that.

We played it twice but for no more than a total of three hours and never again.  It would have been OK but there was absolutely no story to keep us invested in it traveling was boring and no one understood how to use the battle system properly.  We couldnt advance our classes because it was reliant on doing the special abilities numerous times no one understood how to pull off just once in the first place.I didnt buy it because I expected Monster Hunter x Final Fantasy.  To be fair I was never a fan of MH to begin with.  I was however a big fan of the later Crystal Chronical games on the DS that my friends and I had a blast playing multiplayer with.  I expected it to be similar but what we got was really half baked.  The entire thing felt like it was intended to be a mini game to some greater game that never came to fruition.

8293016,0,t1_d5dw2aa,gt Colosseum  Pokken I guess is as close as this generation of consoles will see. I would love to see one on the next console.As much as Colosseum and XD were only average games they are basically proof that the Pokemon formula is incredibly flexible you could have pretty much any story you want and fit Pokemon into it you could have any kind of world and the sky is the limit really. Makes me so sad that they refused to do anything remotely creative with the main series.Like hell sure it was a spinoff but they even made game set in feudal Japan and it felt perfectly fine thematically.Puzzle LeagueI dont even care about the Pokemon aspect here just give us a new Puzzle League that uses buttons please!,3DS,d5e6psl,2,t5_2ruhy
8293601,0,t1_d5e92a6,gt Im really hopeful that this isnt the last chance Ill get to CFWRealistically it probably is. The reason that CFW installation requires a downgrade to . is that that was the last system version that had an ARM exploit  necessary for the kind of full access that setting up CFW requires. . came out in October . The nature of the patch that Nintendo applied with . in May is such that downgrading systems is now impossible without another ARM exploit to circumvent the version checks. There hasnt been another one found in the intervening two years I wouldnt feel optimistic about its prospects. The sole two workarounds for downgrading on . soldering an SD card reader to your DS motherboard  an untested pretty obscure DSiWare exploit only exist in the first place because of a minor oversight on Nintendos part the security hole in question there will almost certainly be patched in the next firmware update which will close downgrading and CFW pretty much permanently. The presence of an interested developer community isnt a guarantee that more security holes will be found the DSis homebrewhacking scene dried up overnight after the .. update blocked off all the viable entrypoints and the PS Vita still hasnt been properly hacked despite releasing at the same time as the DS. Its pretty likely that DS CFW will be closed off permanently unless you get in while you can.,3DS,d5e9cjk,1,t5_2ruhy

8332607,0,t1_d5j3yty,Honestly Id say the better strategy would be to invest that time in U rather than Generations  the beginning portions of all MonHan games are basically the same so youd just be repeating the same thing you already did in U by playing the first  hours of Generations.The next  hours of U is likely to be much more interesting and new than the first  hours of Gen. MonHan is one of those games where the further you get and the higher your personal skill gets much more important to learn enemy tactics than it is to gather equipment the more youll get from the game.Just replaying the early bits each time a new game comes out will be kinda repetitive and redundant and youll end up having spent  hours in the MonHan series without ever reaching the bits that make people love the series so much!,3DS,d5j4qgh,2,t5_2ruhy

8549256,0,t3_4wvci4,You might have a counterfeit Pokemon cartridge.  The DS Pokemon games are probably one of the most counterfeited games available now due to their popularity and the prices that they command.If you can post a picture of the front and back of the cartridge people will likely be able to tell if its a fake or not.  Sometimes DS games have to be pushed in a little harder since the DS games dont have the extra nub on the cartridge they can shift out of place.I would guess that since this is the only game youre having issues with its more likely that you have a fake cart. ,3DS,d6a894q,10,t5_2ruhy

8567840,0,t3_4wzj49,If youre mainly looking for games with job classes there are a good number on the ds Etrian oddysey  might be a very good fit its a first person dungeon crawler with turnbased combat you make a party and move them through dungeons you can even subclass and choose which skills you want per level up. Another game thats more of an action rpg would be fantasy life you canswitch jobs on the fly and level them up but only for your main character but youll usually have to level up a bunch of different ones to level upacertain one say two gathering jobs for a crafting job and a crafting job for a fighting job so you have better gear and so on so its a bit of management but it can be a grindfest.I dont think I saw anyone mention disgaea on the ds its a tactical rpg that besides the protags you can make party members who fit jobs I think its been a long time since Ive played it though so yeah I may be wrong.,3DS,d6ck6h2,2,t5_2ruhy

I notice a slight slowdown when tossing out a bigger Pokemon in Y especially during wild horde battles but for the most part its fine.Doesnt ruin the experience but it would of course be nice to not have the framerate dips at all.I would only recommend the DS on two conditions If you want a budget system without the D effect. If you dont mind it being less portable.You cant fold it and put it in your pocket but its cheaper a neat design and can play nearly every single DS game on the market.So if you ever want to play Xenoblade Chronicles or SNES games on handheld make sure to get a New DS.I really like my DS though.

She has been wrong a number of times but most notable was when she said that she would stop reporting on leaks etc if she was wrong going into an E a few years back. She was of course not correct on all of her claims then edited the post to remove some though not all of her predictions and continued on without stopping as she declared she would not do. This was back in .  Some of those predictions included no hard drive on the Wii U obviously wrong Soul Calibur  as a Wii U launch title never released on the Wii U Pikmin  at that E didnt happen until a year later and didnt release for another year after that and a slew of others though most were fairly easy and general predictions. I believe she has also posted faked photos of Pikmin  though I dont recall where I saw that at the moment you can take that with a grain of salt.She has a shitty track record and she wont even keep her own promises. She has no integrity and just wants attention and people keep giving it to her. I dont know why.,3DS,d74f4ld,6,t5_2ruhy

I havent bought a lot of DS games over the years but there seem to be a lot of quality games that just arent my type of thing mostly RPGs.Im pumped for the new Pokemon games as usual but the new Metroid doesnt look very appealing at all. Pikmin is exciting to see though I didnt see it was announced until now.As someone who already owns a Wii U though I probably wont pick up Woolly World as Ive already played it  and while Im still playing Super Mario Maker a ton and could see it being lots of fun on the DS it doesnt look like it will live up to the Wii U version. I suppose if you only had a DS itd still be fun though.Kinda bummed that the Wii U has gone by the wayside but hey what can you do. I hope that Paper Mario Color Splash is good but its looking like another Sticker Star which I didnt think was bad personally just not nearly as good as the first two.

8951307,0,t3_52s9sn,Hi! One big thing that I didnt see anyone else point out I skimmed the long comments though oops if they did is that Pokemon didnt use to be this easy until the advent of the new EXP Share. Previously EXP Share was an item you got to give one and only one Pokemon. It was used to help you train Pokemon that were otherwise weak or unviable. In recent games EXP Share is just a game option that you toggle to give ALL your inactive Pokemon experience and allows you to literally steamroll all over the game and back again blindfolded with your hands behind your back. While its convenient for training it also does take the fun out of all the story encounters. I personally would much rather have EXP Share included as part of a difficulty setting which you can decide on in the beginning of a game which I just now realized would be an amazing addition to the Pokemon series.That being said as you noticed online multiplayer is very competitive and I personally never got into it. There is a LOT of depth to it and breeding the right Pokemon far more than I have the time for. This is where most people get their hundreds of hours of gameplay. If youre mainly playing for the main story like me I suggest switching off EXP Share for a start. You might also try a collectors approach and attempt to collect them all Ive never succeeded haha. Have fun!,3DS,d7ntb33,0,t5_2ruhy
8952876,0,t1_d7mywoc,Exactly this.  Almost all of my games are digital so I can play whatever I want on the go without having to carry around a bunch of cartridges.  Since large MicroSDs are pretty cheap even storage space isnt really a concern.,3DS,d7o037m,2,t5_2ruhy

8996090,0,t3_53c4ee,The combat in SMT Devil Survivor  Record Breaker broke the game for me. The tactical aspect was fine though Id prefer it it were more zoomed in the overworld aspect was cool I liked the mission selection aspect the characters were obnoxious but totally bearable but the way that you dont see your own characters in battle just  turned me off from the game. I just didnt feel as invested in the battles or characters because battle was just some abstract process rather than the characters actually engaging the enemy.As for things that made the game the sheer density of things to do in Fantasy Life did that. Going out and doing things for one life meant that you were also able to gather herbs vegetables and meat for cooking gather metals for mining and blacksmithing and harvest wood for woodcutting and carpentry. Sure there are perks for being a life while doing tasks for it but being able to engage in your offjobs at almost any time kept me busy and engaged.,3DS,d7t6vfr,1,t5_2ruhy

9080761,0,t3_54hwyb,Im a PC gamer and have recently decided that I want to buy one of the new DS systems. Im not too sure which out of the two I should buy while the XL version goes for around  more than the regular NDS Im not sure whether the extra cost is worth the larger screen size and Im just wondering which is the preferred model here. With the larger screen is it noticeable having the image just stretched to fit the larger screen?Also being a PC gamer Im not used to spending huge sums of money on the games themselves the games on the DS seem pretty pricey given the age of some of the games... Im not sure what the general consensus is on ROMs and R cartridges on this sub but I remember when I had my DS lite I could just download the ROM of a game and play it until I was comfortable enough to shell out the money to pay for it would I still be able to buy an R card for a NDS and play games from that until I wish to purchase them? As I think that would sway my decision on whether to buy a NDS or not. Any responses are greatly appreciated! Thank you ,3DS,d83cyy3,1,t5_2ruhy

9181490,0,t1_d8f7x7t,?!  MOVE OVER YOUNGSTER!  In MY day.....Kidding.  Im ONLY .  YES its good to have all of these games not only readily available but PORTABLE!  I have over  downloaded games none retail on DS but my SNES collection consists of SMW ALTTP Super Metroid DKC  and  Mario Kart Mega Man VII Mega Man X Mystical Ninja Final Fight  Super Punch Out Super Ghouls n Ghosts Contra III Earthbound Castlevania IV and SF Alpha II.  As if I didnt love my DS enough now its like my child.Earthbound is an odd one for me.  I saw it payed once when I was  and it looked okay but I was still in high school and only worked like  hours a week I couldnt afford many games and Im pretty sure the last few SNES games I bought were Yoshis Island Mega Man VII and Castlevania Dracula X so I couldnt afford a game I wasnt sure if I wanted.  Fast Forward to like two months ago I get it in high hopes that Ill enjoy this cult hit..... but Im oddly let down.  Maybe its kind of an injoke of sorts but I just find it so ugly in every aspect the graphics look like they were drawn on Windows  MSPaint the music is a boring melange of very lowfi audio spam and bleeps the fights are like a more frustrating version of original Dragon Quest and although I can see how it was funny in its time the dialogue is so harshly juvenile and nonsensical that I have a hard time fathoming what Im reading wondering if it really is such pure nonsense or if Im just tired or distracted.  Im not going to say its a bad game but it just isnt for me and I dont even think  year old me would like it.My only complaint with DS SNES VC is the apparent pattern so far Nintendo dumped all of their st party gems on us of course withholding anything with the Super FX Chip and Mario RPG which I assume will be the last sale they try to make when the system is almost phased out ala Wii then they moved to a pattern of Week capcom Week nada Week Konami Week nada repeat.  I just want some other games in there from Square like FFVI III or Secret of Mana but I already know I have to wait through Mega Man X Castlevania Dracula X and Mega Man X before they move to the next.

9199344,0,t3_56c1uc,Final Fantasy Explorers I suppose? And Soul sacrifice I think. Everything its similar to is called a Monster Hunter clone.As for what I like about MH its mostly the rush of evading monster attacks leaping onto its back and stabbing it breaking their wings and tails and finishing it off with a Gunlance Wyvern Fire attack. Therell be those tense moments where a monster will have gotten some status effect on you and you need to recover while theyre rampaging towards you. And then when you beat em you get make equipment out of their pieces.Also the concepts and designs are neat. Its the only fantasy world I can think of where magic is heavily downplayed or nonexistent not acquainted enough with it to say for sure and everythings based on abilities all these creatures adapted to.

9372925,0,t1_d942cap,I really want an rpg that will last a long time too D In my opinion Fire Emblem doesnt have a long playtime in that you can finish the story really quickly if you want. To make it last I feel as though you have to replay look for challenges do the extra levels grind for better weapons etc. UNLESS you buy the DLCs. I havent played Xenoblade but I hear its really long maybe a bit too long according to some people. They said the first part of the game was tedious and boring until you got the mech. BUT of course this is all just MY and some other peoples opinion. Fire emblem and xenoblade are both good games Im just saying they might not be what you are looking for. I really enjoyed Fire Emblem anyway. Also do you want to check out other games? I personally recommend Fantasy Life. I feel that its the embodiment of RPG on the DS and its pretty long especially if you do the side quests. I feel that it had the most traditional RPG elements? Idk check it out if youre interested I enjoyed it a lot D,3DS,d9432cl,1,t5_2ruhy

9554437,0,t3_5bnby8,For Harvest Moon I would actually like to suggest looking into Rune Factory . It has farming crafting and gathering like HM but it also has a fast paced combat system kind of like the Ys series. Its one of my favorite games by far on the system.Generations is my first MH game and I love it. I have heard from a friend that it has a lot of references to older games and therefore its really best experienced by those who have played all the ones before it. He also has said that it would be difficult to go back to the games after Generations thanks to the Arts and other additions.What you could do is download a demo of U and see how you like it. And if you do play that first then you can just wait until XX is released in the US next year.Otherwise you can just pick up Generations for the higher population and the fact that youre getting the newest version. I like arts and styles a lot and I think its fine for new players based on my own experience.Dreamteam is a solid MampL game but not as good as the original or Inside Story. It is worth a try but a lot of fans have said they think it is a fairly weak installment.If you play primarily digital definitely get a bigger SD. I have  and its nearly full of games. I transferred everything successfully from the default to this one.As a bonus suggestion  an overlooked game suggestion Gotta Protectors. If you ever played NES era games you should check it out. Its a cheap digital only game and it is very funny and fun. ,3DS,d9qs520,1,t5_2ruhy

Im still a keyboardmouse proponent but the DS does very well.If I were to gripe about anything itd be lack of internet multiplayer and the bugginess of the initial release.  Even though devs can push patches and all devices are onlineconnectable I still dont feel crashes are in any way acceptable for a console game.  PC  fine lots of things could go wrong there.  Consoles?  Nah it was a rushed port but getting better with every patch.,3DS,d9zr20k,1,t5_2ruhy

Make sense to buy an nDS system if youre buying new.. People who always wanted to give the DS a shot and with the Switch on the horizon are now taking advantage of its final form hardware and huge library.To combat Nintendo issued the Black Friday nDS this year.  Stores like Target also offered  off the nDSXL that same weekend.  The price was probably as good as it would get to make the move.Item  is straight forward.  If youre buying new get the updated version.  It costs the same.  Duh.Item  is also straight forward.  If youre just now getting into the DS for the first time get the updated version.

It has  years of dedicated DS software plus backwards compatibility with an additional  years of Nintendo DS software plus the ability to download hundreds of games from virtual console from older systems NES SNES Gameboy GBC Genesis Master System Game Gear.     This holiday season had the release of a new Pokemon generation which caused a spike in Nintendo ds and new DS sales so its been near impossible to find one on a store shelf since November. They released the smaller model of newds for  on Black Friday and those pop up every now and again but are still out of stock pretty much everywhere. A new DS model costs  but are also impossible to find right now. Why the newdsXL still costs  brand new I cant tell you. It seems like those should have dropped in price by now but  for the smaller one or  for the DS isnt a bad deal for this system the only problem is Nintendo didnt anticipate selling out of all of them this holiday season. ,3DS,dc1e1bd,7,t5_2ruhy

10600391,0,t3_5rna5d,I think the only possible way Nintendo should ever consider another handheld device is if its completely compatible with all Switch games. Basically a smaller nondockable version of the switch perhaps with a  inch screen so that it can have lower resolution and a lower clocked gpu without sacrificing image quality. This way they dont fracture their userbase into two separate ecosystems where neither system benefits from the full force of Nintendos software output. Essentially I think its necessary to Nintendos success that they put all their development efforts toward one platform. Theyve already proven that they cannot support two independent systems with enough software for both to be successful.,3DS,dd9ckx6,1,t5_2ruhy

11007253,0,t1_defe2xf,The biggest misconception here is that people will buy something because its NIntendo and all DS users will magically flock to the Switch. The WiiU has proven that this is not exactly the case. The Switch offers more freedom to console gamers and Im sure this is a blessing to them but some people are far too busy to be tied to a home system and its assumed the Switch is good for this but its not a quick pick to leave the house with. Losing parts could set you back at least .USD its not pocket friendly and its battery life at best is on par with the DS. Handheld gaming is less about having up to date graphics and more about convenience and opportunity and the Switch just doesnt play this game. To somebody who is fairly busy the console portion is just a wasted price because they wouldnt be using it and nevermind that the DS and even DS are already solid. Short of some amazing games that would be wonderful on a local scale most handheld users will use a phone or their older models for long trips. ,3DS,defn3i2,1,t5_2ruhy

All the games are very popular and for good reason.People may say Im wrong in my assessment of pokemon but that is partially subjective I maintain those games are the best that are on the DS.From there you can expand if you like any of those  series. Bravely default has a direct sequel same characters return and expand the story of the first while spinning a new story all at once with some minor gameplay changes.Fire Emblem has the  game follow up of fatesrevelationbirthrightconquest all in the same story arc but with different missions and characters etc. And of course we are getting Echoes out soon too which is a sort of revamp of a very old fire emblem game too.Pokemon has XY and the new SunMoon games.There are tons of Dragon Quest games to play on the DS and DS as well just pick and choose.I am a zelda freak so Id say pick up Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask if you havent already. Both make minor changes to the originals including graphics and they are really good because of it. I would probably not like to play the old N versions after doing it on DS with the improvements made.ANyhow pick and choose lots of good titles but Id say those first three are a great place to start if you are unsure after that the sky is the limit.

Gameplay is awesomestory is a bit complicated but very enjoyable characters are great and playing those games was one of best times I ever had with videogames. But youll probably have to grind quite a lot towards lategame. Even so in lategame grinding is simplified so it shouldnt be too hard. I havent finished Pokemon moon yet buteven so I can assure you that those are some of the best pokemon games ever not counting the spinoffs. You should give them a try.And lastly you should try Xenoblade Chronocles. I personaly havent played them yet but it is widely recognized as some of the best RPGs out there.,3DS,deye70s,1,t5_2ruhy

It has better production value than a lot of Wii U games which maybe isnt saying much lol. Not to mention the OST was STELLAR. If the controls werent such a struggle I firmly believe itd be considered one of Nintendos GOAT. Its a shame they wont ever patch Cstick controls. That would fix a majority of problems.

Controls are pretty simple to understand and responsive enough.  Doesnt overly favor multiplayer as many of these styles of games do.I enjoyed the game a lot I dont know if Id pay more than  for it now.

11221831,0,t1_df2ypon,The unit came today! I wouldnt have rated it as retail like condition since it came with a few hair line scratches on the outside casing and other very minor imperfections but it is definitely grade A condition. Came in a retail box without any of the inserts or manuals. Just the unit with some foam padding around it. So far everything is working as expected. d definitely takes some getting used to. I played a bit of monster hunter and the d would lose focus and quickly refocus every  to  seconds. I since recalibrate it and played a level of Mario d Land and didnt have that same problem. The d effect in that game is stellar. My head feels a little weird right now and when the d is out of focus it feels really weird but once it focuses I dont feel too weird. Im hoping Ill get used to it and quirks of the face tracking because it does add alot to the immersion of the games. ,3DS,df3zb82,1,t5_2ruhy

Got the dreamgear comfort grip now and added a skin to my new xl black. I believe the paint problem for the new dsXL is caused from the oils and sweat from your hands. From what Ive read itll start happening with in mo   years for the paint to start coming off. Depends on the person and how often they use it.

11309375,0,t1_dfdw3vj,That what they always say when they release a new console but if we are to judge by Nintendos past behaviour the Switch is poised to be the successor of the DS. Nobody is going to say that their new product will substitute their previous one in their lineup because if the Switch turns out to be a flop theyre left with nothing. Back then the NDS was released they said there were to be two different portable lineups and that the NDS didnt compete at all with the GBA and more Game Boys were coming. Well the NDS sold so well they just axed the Game Boy altogether but they DID release one last GB the Micro. If the NDS sold poorly they couldve just said we never planned to phase out the Game Boy lineup dont worry!. Its all about customer and developer confidence.The Switch has a hardware that largely compatible with the DS built on the same ARM platform and porting games between both platforms is exceedingly easy. The Switch has much more in common with a DS than with the WiiU and it pains em to admit it but Nintendo is putting all their eggs on the portable basket now insteadof trying to compete with Sony and Microsoft on specs. This is another GBANDS situation and it all depends on how well the Switch ends up selling. If the Switch ends up being a failed experiment that can always release a new DS in  years or so and claim the Switch was a living room console all along.,3DS,dfdwffu,1,t5_2ruhy

11372386,0,t3_62ajc7,My personal opinion is to start from the beginning or game  if you remember clearly what happened in game  because it just adds value knowing all the stories of the entire franchise.  Some of the games are easier than others some require some crazy mental gymnastics or have tough gating mechanisms when trying to collect evidence that must be found in a certain order.Each game has its own mechanism to tell whether there is witness contradictions.  In the original game it was those weird PsycheLocks but in later games its also Perceive which is to find nervous twitches while the witness is talking similar to poker tells or the Mood Matrix one of the games which get you to find the inconsistent emotion with the statement.  If you jump straight to game  youd probably be okay but they use a lot of the old mechanisms in the storyline and add a new one Divination Seances.I think my personal favoritemost memorable was Apollo Justice Game  but if you want to do the series due diligence Id honestly play them in order.  The newest game is still pretty accessible but it takes place in a foreign land which has more significance if you play the earlier games.  None of the games are super dated because theyre all in the same style for the most part so you can just go through them take your time and enjoy ,3DS,dfl1em2,2,t5_2ruhy

11404491,0,t1_dfo4p63,Ok so you dont agree thats fine but you dont have to be a dick. This is my opinion you may think its stupid but let me elaborate.I absolutely do believe the DSDS will stay on the market it will be a cheap alternative for children. Will it receive first party games? Probably not maybe a few. There are always people that want or need a cheap alternative and until they can offer the Switch at a DS price point what is it  dollars with a game? they will continue to sell the DS.Why are you so uptight about this? Having a low level entry system will not eat sales from the Switch but it will bring more and more peoplechildren to the Nintendo brand.If they are going to do a next handheld depends on the demand for such a system so I wont rule it out.,3DS,dfoonmz,1,t5_2ruhy

11447793,1,t3_63f23g,This might be an unpopular opinion but the series needs a rest. Ive followed the series since  and feel its as strong as ever but the amount of recent releases is making the series feel overused by Nintendo.For context there was six Zelda titles released betwen . In the past five years weve seen Ocarina of Time D Majoras Mask D Hyrule Warriors Wii U and DS Triforce Heroes Wind Waker HD Twilight Princess HD Breath of the Wild and Skyward Sword just over five years old.Adding two more to that would be overwhelming IMO. I enjoy Breath of the Wild because it gives that feeling of Hey this is the new console and this is what it can do. It helped maintain a standard and I feel like its starting to slip with games like Triforce Heroes which isnt a bad game its just not the standard I expect for Zelda games.

Every character has a lot of skill customization potential as well.,3DS,dg71hhz,2,t5_2ruhy

11651259,0,t1_dgfr2xm,Local play on the DS uses local wireless which doesnt involve being connected to a WiFi network at all. The two consoles just communicate directly with each other. Which unfortunately means that for games with only local play and no online you really do need to be physically near each other.I guess it might theoretically be possible to reroute the signal to go through an internet connection on a hacked DS running custom firmware but Ive never seen anyone even mention that theyd have any interest in a DS program that could do that let alone that anyones succeeded in writing one.Sorry ,3DS,dggonh7,1,t5_2ruhy

11692605,0,t3_66qmvc, Metroid Prime Federation Force ODS. I bought the game having only played Zero Mission a few years back. Its surprisingly decent with moments of fun and greatness. It sucks I barely find a match to play coop. Terminator Salvation The Video Game XBOX  Sue me. But i actually thought it was fine like the movie it was based on granted i didnt buy it when it first released. idk if this counts Destiny PS. Technically not negative reviews but I did keep hearing negative word of mouth when the game released. I am glad that I decided to get it as I do find the game fun and I think its a good game to play. Sure it feels like a grind at times but I still find it enjoyable overall.,3DS,dgldie9,1,t5_2ruhy

11729949,0,t1_dgplf99,Did you autocorrect my quote? lol. And no Im not a scalper myself. But I have ordered from scalpers and never felt particularly ripped off. I think of it this way There are services that you pay to wait in lines for you. A scalper is essentially performing the same service but charges you after the fact. Also they have to compete with other scalpers pricing so you typically dont get super wild markups for physical goods. If anyones to blame for you not getting the physical goods you wanted its the company producing them for creating artificial scarcity. ,3DS,dgpmc8d,5,t5_2ruhy

11760286,0,t3_67s69z,I second Fantasy Life. Its easy enough to play when youre feeling less than  but involved enough to really take your mind off of whats bothering you. Plus its just fun. If you do play I recommend playing all or nearly all the lives careers the game offers.
