I think that was probably the initial spark which led to the whole chain of events culminating in the cost of abatementremovaldemolition was literally approaching a billion dollars and that is enough money to get anyone to do pretty much anything. The fact that it had a whole lot of flowon effects was just a bonus.As far as Osama goes I agree obviously that he was the perfect patsy because he was soon going to be dead and dead men tell no tales. Another dead man and one who is so often forgotten is Ahmad Shah Massoud the Lion of Panjshir who was assassinated on September  because the first thing that would have happened once America invaded Afghanistan was that he would have become the leader and being incorruptible that was never an option.Anyway all of this is contained in Vigilant Guardians as I have said.

538466,0,t1_cg1gm0b,gtYeah gotta say this is where the discussion ceases. If youre arguing that thin air is not the path of least resistance we have approximately zero common ground.But the choice of path was twofold down or downout. The choice of just simply moving laterally doesnt exist. There is no path whatsoever where the only resistance is thin air. It is a false presumption.Going down the resistance was the floors and the entire rest of the structure. Going out the resistance was the core columns held together by the floors standing on the rest of the structure. Gravity was the driving force in both alternatives and there simply is no earthly way anything involved could have simply moved laterally right off the side of the building or rolled any which way to the same effect.There were no significant lateral forces but there was significant vertical downward force as well as inward force from the prebuckling core columns. The force effected on them was met with the force of them right back but in the end it is plainly visible which force won out. But the outer core columns and latticework was still resistance however you look at it.You simply havent explained why any part of the building during the collapse should have moved laterally as opposed to vertically. Thats what had to have happened for thin air to be the only resistance.gtAlso Fma. Force equals mass times acceleration.Right and even assuming your calculation of the mass of the top floors as well as the acceleration is correct your flaw is in what part of the bottom structure took the brunt of that force.gtFinally your scare quotes around retired physics teacher and implication that a B.S. in physics is somehow not enough credential compared to the people working on the NIST report is in fact actively insulting.Retired physics teacher is a direct quote from the description of the video in which I first saw his presentation. I did not write it. The person who uploaded the presentation did. Hence the quote marks.Secondly maybe it is enough credential but it combined with his presentation suggests to me its not. Hes still calculating the necessary force as if a completely stable top part landed completely perfectly on the completely stable bottom part right on every point designed to bear that particular weight. It is simply misleading to say the least to describe the process in that manner as I have explained above.gtYou should be aware that it was David Chandler specifically whose work on Building  compelled NIST to acknowledge officially that for . seconds the building was in actual free fall.I havent seen his work on WTC  so I cant comment on it. Were discussing  and  here are we not? And regarding  and  hes simply wrong.gtSo yeah there is no world in which the statement that his expertise is far far outweighed has any credibility whatsoever.A Bachelor of Science ... is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for completed courses that generally last three to five years. emphasis mine. The people who wrote the NIST report included several Ph.Ds a degree that requires you to actually prove you are worthy of that title as opposed to simply completing your studies. There is a difference in credibility whether you want to admit it or not and I am not going to accept your argument that a retired physics teacher again the title used by people who support with him and his theories is perfectly equal to a team of people with actual doctorate degrees.Add to that the fact that his paper is submitted to an onlineonly pro conspiracy journal and thereby not directly submitted to the scrutiny of the larger scientific community. His authority on the matter is therefor not in any way shape or form equal to that of the NIST team members.,911truth,cg1hays,0,t5_2qh3c

790653,0,t1_cgu4cc8,The cell phone calls is HUGE. It has been tested numerous times and does not work. It is not possible. And yet there it is. I dont buy the its a scam or a frame analysis. The fact that the calls were made at all is phony enough to anyone that understands how this works. CNN even posted an article in the last two weeks on thisgtCell phones communicate through cell towers which are located on the ground but can stretch hundreds of feet into the air. As an airplane rises it gets further from these towers and eventually moves out of contact range. For efficiency many towers are designed to direct their signal where its most useful on the ground not into the sky above. MH copilots cell phone was on Why were no calls made from Flight ? MH Why AUV ended search early?The maximum distance at which a phone can still make calls and send texts varies depending on the type of tower and transmitter but an airplane would have to be no more than  feet in the air for any cell phones on board to still have a signal according to Bill Rojas director of telecom research at IDC Asia Pacific.Its not just altitude that can limit cell phone service.When flying over sparsely populated rural areas nearby towers are fewer and farther between. Over the open ocean there are no towers at all with which to communicate making phone calls texts and social media posts impossible.Re the collapse... the WTC was a Rockefeller project. It had budget and was engineered to have as little risk as possible. At the time the buildings went up naysayers were warning that the towers would topple if an airplane hit them or if a onceinacentury hurricane hit NYC. The towers were overdesigned and in fact the designers said they could easily have gone taller with the solid way they were built. Yet somehow both magically fell down. Its mindblowing to me to think that people believe that the WTC fell down due to fires. DID YOU KNOW For instance the Ibeams in the areas of both plane impacts were  in thickness. This is because the buildings use of structural steel tapered from the bottom because not as much steel was needed to support the weight of the top floors. In other words from the th floor on up the area above the impact zones comprised . of the WTCs total weight. Collapse? Not possible.As for the gold trucks remember Google is your friend.

It is also the only product in those debris that could reach the reported F temperatures since thermite itself burns as hot as F.All of this is true.

Or even  week.gtUnless there is a product that was present in the debris at such quantity that could burn as hot and last as long thermite is the only explanation that fits this issue and all of the others before that are inheritedly linked such as the thermite residue being found and it being found before or after the clean up crews.The finding of thermite residue to begin with has been disputed and not in any meaningful way conclusively proven.This is ridiculous.

Oh yeah thats right WTC fell on itThe primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the citys water supply whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC  and WTC .So youre wrong about that too. gtThe windsor tower burn for  hours and didnt turn into a pile of rubble.The Windsor tower is shorter designed completely differently than WTC that tube within a tube design you deny and had firefighters working on it for  hours.And despite all of that it still suffered a partial collapse.So youre wrong about that too. gtgtwith its outer facade concentrating the heat and funneling it up and out?gtI almost died laughing.Pity.This is the memo that uPhrygianMode uses as his mantra for refuting the NIST report.Of particular note item  the summary emphasis addedIn summary we do not agree with the conclusions of the analysis. The accuracy of the FDS fire temperatures claculated depends entirely upon the assumptions used. Any chimney effects could have produced much hotter fire temperatures. We have not found any accurate method of predicting fire temperatures in large enclosures but it appears that more severe conditions are produced as the distance from the facade to the building core increases. For ventilation a midrange condition with high burning rate but limited heat loss to outside may be the most severe. In the current case for a distance of  m with midrange ventilation very severe conditions may be expected. We therefore believe that the steel beams failed due to reaching much higher temperatures than reported. This resulted from fires which were hotter for longer than calculated and from the small insulation thickness.Because WTCs long floor spans  meters is  feet from the outer facade to the inner core the building acted like a giant chimney.Unless you want to argue that the Proe Thomas memo is bullshit.

Ten days later theres at least a decent amount of information and pictures and video but still no real data.  So the first statement is just a gut reaction the retraction  days later is just an update based on more information but neither is based on any sort of research or real data.  So its all just opinion and should be treated as such.Clearly all of us learned a lot in those first  days and formed and changed opinions as more information came in.  For example Im sure that almost no one felt that it was a false flag operation with drone planes when only WTC  had been hit but before WTC  was hit so clearly everyone changed their opinion in those early days since there was little known in the first hours after the WTCs were struck.Does anyone know what his opinion is now  years later?,911truth,ckxzhii,1,t5_2qh3c

2513119,0,t3_2oaaeq,gtYou sound like a conspiracy theorist.RESPONSE Conspiracy Theorist? Now tell me the truth where did you hear that term...on TV? Laugh. ...So let me get this straight. Are you saying that men in high positions of power are not capable of criminal activity and telling lies to the general public? Are you really that naive? Laugh as you say this.MY RESPONSE It isnt a question of whether people in high places commit crimes. Its a matter of evidence. Sure priests rape children I know this because there are historical examples but just because its happened before doesnt mean the Pope is a child molester. In the same way I know conspiracies have happened in the past that is not evidence that any specific conspiracy theory is true.gtIm not saying that governments dont lie but a conspiracy like that would have to involve s of people. You cant hide something like that.RESPONSE Youre absolutely right. I agree with you . It is impossible to totally cover up a conspiracy so massive. Thats why I know about it! What you must understand is that they dont have to cover it up totally. Even a bucket that has a few  leaks can still do the job of carrying water from here to there! They only need to fool  of the public which isnt hard to do when you control the major networks and newspapers. The  that do figure it out and the fewer still who will dare to speak their minds about it can be very easily marginalized with the propaganda label conspiracy theorist. The    never take us critical thinkers seriously because they want to be part of the majority. This is known as groupthink. Note When saying conspiracy theorist always hold your two hands up as you make sarcastic quote marks with your fingers.  MY RESPONSE Again it comes down to evidence. Saying a conspiracy would require hundreds of people is a way of saying that sooner or later someone would come out with not only a story but also some hard evidence. If someone does come out with hard evidence of a conspiracy theory it because historical fact i.e. Watergate. However this has yet to happen with any of the common conspiracy theories like  etc. gtThe Ridicule Trick Thats ridiculous as he rolls his eyes. Do you really believe that nonsense?RESPONSE Can I ask you an honest question? Wait for yes Do you consider yourself an open minded critical thinking person  yes or no? Wait for yes  Then how can you possibly ridicule an opinion when you havent even done  minutes of research into the matter? Thats kind of ignorant dont you think? Wait for response.MY RESPONSE No. The conspiracy theorist is the one making the claim. Thus it is up to them to present the evidence. If they can not I am in no way less rational for disbelieving them. If I told you I have a pet unicorn it would be up to me to provide proof. You are not logically obligated to believe me.gtNot everything that happens in the world is a conspiracy! RESPONSE Not everything is a conspiracy but nor is NOTHING a conspiracy either. Wouldnt you agree that we should evaluate each case independently and with an open mind? Wait for response.MY RESPONSE Yes I agree. It is important to evaluate each claim and the evidence behind it. Having an open mid is good but your mind shouldnt be open to everything that would make you pretty gullible. I would say you should go at it with a critical mind.gtGovernments are so incompetant that they cant even deliver the mail on time or balance a budget. They couldnt conspire their way out of a paper bag!.RESPONSE Dont confuse your incompetant dim witted Congressman or Senator with the shadow government. The dark covert elements who stage these events are very skilled at carrying out and concealing their plots. Take for example the Manhattan Project. Hundreds of the worlds top scientists were holed up in a desert for months as they worked on the Atomic Bomb. More than  people each sworn to silence worked on the project in  secret cities. A test bomb was even detonated in the the desert and not one word was said about it! This conspiracy was so secretive that when FDR died and Vice President Truman became President FDRs advisors had to inform him of the Projects existence! So you see the shadowy intelligence element of the government is VERY capable!MY RESPONSE Is there any evidence for the shadow government? You mention the Manhattan project but as Ive said it goes back to evidence and the historical existence of the Manhattan project is not evidence of the existence of a shadow government that routinely carries out these kinds of projects. ,911truth,cmmlq4m,0,t5_2qh3c

2639767,0,t1_cn322sw,gt Theres an answer to that as well.No the answer is to take a deep breath go back to square one and learn There is a big difference between enlightened leadership and what we have today which is stupid leadership. I am not really sympathetic to the argument that technology is moving too fast and I cant keep up ampc. The next generation is fighting wars in a new way and it is attachment to old inefficient outdated obsolete and ineffective methods that irks me.Consider the problem of silencing dissent when leaders wish to fight wars. In the first few minutes of this video The New Phoenix Program which references this book Mindwar by Michael Aquino it is clear that at first relatively crude methods are used for political control. I can certainly understand this and am sympathetic to the need to test new weapons perhaps in secret but Im not particularly moved by the notion that playing whackamole with dissidents is a viable longterm strategy any more than it is with terrorists. Clearly belief formation is a complex process and people are differentiated by various environmental and genetic factors but it seems like it should be clear to most anyone that a person who changes his political beliefs relatively naturally will be able to transmit this journey of rebirth of political consciousness in a way that is able to influence others. This is the viral change in consciousness and is far superior to breaking down wills one by one because the victim has no idea what is going on so there is much less resistance no opportunity for onlookers to become sympathetic ampc. The brute fact of the matter is that differentiation of political viewpoints is mostly a matter of lack of education and underdeveloped reasoning in specific areas. The hippies were hippies because they were raised wrong and didnt get exposed to the basic political framework that would have made them valued members of a democracy. As artists they were productive members of society. As dissidents they added much heat but negligible light to a sensitive system. Its actually quite sad but the reality is that we have the technology to help those people now in ways that are vastly more humane than abuse and harassment. This may be a difficult personal journey for the target but ultimately it is a story of hope and renewal.Now why am I so critical of the power elite when it comes to techniques of persuasion? Reddit is clearly a golden opportunity for mindwar techniques to be applied on a mass scale. Instead of sniping at dissident thought leaders who are marching off in a direction you dont like you can just tilt the playing field by amplifying those techniques that produce the desired change in consciousness. Like magic we get the desired result. This works because the opinions of the elite are much more in line with pragmatic truth than their opponents who have little executive experience. So just by getting people to engage in debate you slowly convert them over to your side. In order to make the process faster sharper arguments are selected. The sharpest techniques involve responding with a question. By phrasing the question in a particular way it is possible to do micro agenda setting. Basically if you want to convert someone you have to reverse engineer their thinking then figure out the NEXT STEP that is required to convert them. Then you figure out the question that gives you the best leverage. This is a bit like using a crowbar to pop off mental fasteners. By asking the target to unfold their thought in a particular way on a particular subject it is possible to fairly rapidly get them to come up with arguments that wind up convincing them of the rightness of the conclusion you wish them to arrive at. And because you asked a question and they participated in the formation of the answer they are biased toward it because it involved them exercising their creativity. It is a bit like getting your opponent to develop the mental muscles you want them to develop.I liken this situation to the chess vs checkers vs marbles rhetoric floating around now google obama checkers. The power elite are playing marbles and their children are playing some more complex game. Maybe magnetic marbles I dont know. The lazy historians and political scientists have neglected a scientific study of those techniques of argument that produce rapid changes in political consciousness. On the counterargument using history as a weapon sounds ridiculous. I mean you can just stop reading right? Well not really. If the history represents actual revealed political truth and is an engaging evolutionary drama or at least the best approximation of truth that humanity has produced so far there really is only one story and it is the story that power elite want you to hear because it is the story that they are living out as well.I mean who knew that leftwing antiwar activism was  ignorance and  courage? It makes that whole neocon liberal mugged by reality thing sound quite plausible.I would add that freedom is freedom from ignorance as well for it is ignorance that creates the conditions for slavery. It is now the responsibility of those in power to give freedom by reverse engineering the condition of ignorance. This is a hard problem there is a name for the effect whereby it is extremely difficult for an enlightened person to see a problem from the perspective of an unenlightened person there is a special wiki page on it but thats what Im talking about. There needs to be a serious project to identify those doors a person needs to open IN SEQUENCE in order to arrive at the truth.I strongly disagree with your first response.

But then it turns out the Anthrax was from a highlyclassified U.S. military strain.  The hijackers did not get it from Iraq as Team CheneyBush was preparing us to believe.So it looks very much like the Anthrax perpetrators who we know used the U.S. military Ames strain were trying to link the anthrax to both IRAQ and the HIJACKERS.So the FBI wants us to believe either one of two things  Its a coincidence that the hijackers were connected to the first anthrax death victim of an alleged lone nut scientist Bruce Ivins attack who had no knowledge of his targets connection to the hijackersor   Lone Nut Scientist Bruce Ivins specifically learned of Robert Stephens strange connection to the alleged  hijackers and killed him to frame them in connection with the anthrax.This pattern bears a striking similarity to the Boston Marathon bombings.It looks as though the intent of the Boston Marathon bombing was to frame Russia for statesponsored terror.Unfortunately for the FBI Russia preempted the framing and announced to the world that Russia itself had already warned the FBI and that the FBI had already been in contact with the Tsarnaevs.In much the same way that the Anthrax Attacks were supposed to frame the  hijackers amp connect them to Iraqi Anthrax the Tsarnaevs were being bootlegged and sheepdipped to LOOK like Russianexported terrorists.,911truth,cpfuo8q,3,t5_2qh3c

The gist of what i got out of it in general is that most pilots havent even heard of the Vd design dive limit its not given to them on their instruments because theyre not even supposed to come anywhere NEAR that speed and as far as theyre concerned once you exceed the Vmo max operating speed its all over as far as highprecision controlled flight goes where at that speed any real attempt at control surface deflection flaps rudder slats will lead to breakage and at the very least unresponsiveness ergo  you cannot fly and precision maneuver a standard unmodified Boeing  at a speed of   knots   ft. alt. no matter who you are whether an experienced test pilot Pee Wee Herman or Mohammed himself it would make no difference. Now just for kicks stick a novice pilot at the helm and try to imagine him flying the plane successfully to the target at Vmo   knots when a group pilots with s of hours of real flight time on other aircraft types could not hit the target of the WTC in a UA flight sim the very next day unless and until they slowed the  sim they were flying a more maneuverably aircraft than the  to near landing speeds which for a Boeing ER is around  knots and for a Boeing  around  knots. Their flight checker or trainer Dan only managed to hit the target at the higher speed near  knots after a number of tries. He thought that was about as fast as they could go and not any higher because as Vmo is approached  knots  the crash logic of the flight simulator kicks in and so while trying to maneuver you crash and the screen goes red.,911truth,cpw7lvq,5,t5_2qh3c

I can pull up the statement. Link to the email? Not just JREF trolls claiming to have read the email. Link to the actual email?gtThe debunker known as Oystein claims that figure  is invalid because Harrit et al. ignited their chips in air while Tillotson et al. ignited in inert gas. Although Tillotson et al. may have used inert gas for that particular report they did their tests in air for other reports that Harrit et al. cite so the airtest method is valid. The conclusion of the comparison also remains valid because the material that Tillotson tests in that report contains very little organic material so it does not need oxygen to work properly. Traditional thermite does not need external oxygen to work but we dont know if that holds true when the thermite is embedded in an organic material as is the case with Harrits chips. Oystein implies that the presence of air and an organic material proves that there is no thermite reaction only conventional aircombustion but that is total nonsense as we shall see in part II about the signature molten spheres of reduced iron. You can also go ahead and prove that testing in air as opposed to inert invalidates the entirety of the peer reviewed published paper.

Those who dispute this on the grounds that oxygen was present and that the energy came from the combustion of organic material must provide an explanation for why such special conditions are required in a blast furnace to produce iron. The idea that you could heat a little kaolin and coke and iron oxide to a mere  deg C and see it suddenly run away and produce molten iron is clearly a fantasy.Clearly a fantasy. Just like paint  fire  jet fuel accounting for the VOCs. Oh...damn...right. Sorry. You havent worked up the courage on that paper yet. TIL igniting paint chips in atmosphere gives sharper more energetic peaks than Gashs FeOUFG Al nanocomposite!Ah on Oysteins own blog he is called out for placing his own choice of assumptions for the XEDS simulations.So no physical testing and based solely on a computer model. Sound familiar? cough..cough...NIST...cough...coughAnd now we see that Oystein used his own assumptions in creating the simulations...Oystein admits that these choice of assumptions for the XEDS simulations combined with The uncertain composition of the LaClede epoxy with its uncertain amount of N and other elements as well as The lack of N in the spectra all lead to his own admission thatgtI am at this point fully ready to admit that something is wrong about the identification of some redgray chips specifically as LaClede paint. But our interpretation is damned close isnt it?   oysteinClose...but no cigar. You have no peer review. You have no publication. And you have no primer paint. Both peer reviewed published papers giving thermitic evidence still stand. This is why the paint hypothesis isnt published. ,911truth,d0xxx38,2,t5_2qh3c

Since the evidence of all  towers were destroyed it has been left for scientists to theorize and the exact cause of global collapse and seek any remaining evidence to prove this. To date  truth has established that the official account is false the NIST and  commission papers are false and invalid. Jones et al have established that Nanothermite was found in the dust of the WTC! And more recently this paper has being published.I dont know what more you want or expect.If new physical evidence comes to light that will be great and it can be investigated but other than that practically all physical evidence has been destroyed. Unless somehow evidence of coconspirators planning it comes to light which is extremely unlikely at this point or unless a complex model is built or simulated to a high degree of accuracy the available papers is the best we have. Even a new investigation at this point can only reveal what we already know except it may reveal the exact culprits behind the operation but I highly doubt it.If you only look at  truth to hope that some day a juicy new theory or feel that thermite isnt enough for you then you are looking for the wrong reasons.
