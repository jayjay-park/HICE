4481439,0,t1_csvgs5w,Its really not that ridiculous and your comparison isnt really fair seeing as a movie only comes out on one date and plays for a short while. Just because the TV show premiered at the very very end of the nineties and gained all of its popularity in the s doesnt make it a culturally significant part of the nineties. If it wasnt for the real s cartoons there would be no spongebob. And honestly Im guessing you were probably born in the s so you really have no idea what Im trying to say.,90scartoons,csvjw4a,-1,t5_2ubx7
