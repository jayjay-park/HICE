1618,0,t3_1u1tc9,Hi I am HJ and just got into photography a year or so ago. I use my iPhone with either VSCOCam or Hipstamatic. Is that allowed with this project?,365photos,ceemf90,2,t5_2zkzl
14197,0,t3_1u6ero, f. ISO Ive never done anything close to macro photography and I didnt have my tripod on hand but the point is to get photos out there and keep consistent. Only room to improve,365photos,ceg1u0p,1,t5_2zkzl

167172,0,t1_cex7pl1, I am still getting used to the  project. Right now the way I look at it take a random picture and put it up. I mean a decent picture obviously. I am starting to get the new attitude the good one of put at least some effort into it even though it is a photo of the day. Now my main work definitely gets lots of post processing because those are the ones I sell!,365photos,cexh2vy,1,t5_2zkzl
196369,0,t1_cetypeb,Hi. Apologies for not getting back to you I just found this in my moderator queue which if Im honest I didnt know existed before.Feel free to join in at anytime. We are trying to not be too strict on the rules and prefer to let people impose their own rules on themselves and just provide a centralised place to post and talk about it.,365photos,cf0t3o1,1,t5_2zkzl

782472,0,t3_22ylvt,This bloke stopped me on the street in Cracow and asked in Polish if I spoke English. I said that I did. He said again in Polish Well I dont and went on to explain why he didnt speak English. It didnt make much sense but it had something to do with Poland not being America or something. Cant argue with that I guess.  ,365photos,cgt7yp1,2,t5_2zkzl
