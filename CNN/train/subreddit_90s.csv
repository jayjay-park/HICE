7732655,0,t3_4l68j6,I was certainly a Bubblegum and Sodapop decade for kids anyway. I say that figuratively. Video games have finally begun to reach a point of being plentiful creative and fun. We had blocks of Saturday morning cartoons or after school time slots. Food catered to gluttony in every aspect as nobody was vegan nocarb no gluten blahblah that came in full force in the s. We developed stuffed crust pizza biggie fries and biggie drinks big gulps Mcdonalds Pizza and McFlurrys and all that stuff. Music was very interesting as it took a turn for grunge which was glum and new then it transitioned in to a weird era or experimental music that was soft rock with Primitive Radio Gods Age Of Electric or Collective Soul. This led to a full on force of pop then we got slapped with nu metal Korn to go the other direction which led to hip hop metal Limp Bizkit and then when Eminem came about it ushered in a new era of Hip Hop culture that we only sort of shook in the mid s emo green day fall out boy the used but havent eliminated. The s had a good portion of satisfying things to keep the mind dazzled but everyone got fat and unhealthy and it led to a craze of health in the s which is normal now. Where no we have hot yoga gym memberships and that stuff which is normal back then I think only women did aerobics. Heck I remember ash trays in mall food courts or being asked for smoking or non smoking in a restaurant. We were happy gluttonous unhealthy people and thought nothing of it and loved it. Yes I miss the s.,90s,d3l5cbf,3,t5_2rg21
