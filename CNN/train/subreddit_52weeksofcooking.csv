Combine the cachaa cheiro verde garlic chilli flakes lime juice and your favourite oil and mix together then use it to marinate the hearts for about  to  minutes. Remove from marinade and pat dry. Heat a pan to high heat add some oil and then add the red onions sliced. Once the onions soften a little add a bit of salt and a few moments after add the chicken hearts. Saut on high  medium high for about  minutes testing often for doneness. Overcooked chicken hearts are terrible. Once they are almost done I add some minced garlic and keep sauting.

4593511,0,t3_3dxrn7,For this weeks theme I didnt want to just do an ice cream or a sorbet but was a little stuck on what to go with.  I was listening to the Alton Brown podcast and he described the differences between a granita and an icecreamsorbet and it intrigued me.  After searching for a tasty recipe I hit on this one  I wanted to use watermelon because we have been getting some really delicious ones recently and I love the refreshing taste of watermelon juice in the summer.  The addition of the lime and mint added some nice balance to the flavor though the chopped mint was a little weird when eating.  I served it as a parfait with blueberries strawberries and whipped cream and it was a great summer treat.  The partially frozen berries were really fun.In a similar vein and keeping to the granita theme for the cocktail this week I went with a Sangranita  I have to say that this actually went surprisingly well.  Since you cant add rum or brandy to the mixture without dropping the freezing point too far I liked the use of brown sugar to add a little molasses richness to the wine.  In true sangria style I served this with fruit sliced oranges and strawberries.,52weeksofcooking,ct9lsdk,1,t5_2t4i2

6749383,0,t3_4873nb,I did not want to do this week!!!!!  In general I really dislike canned items there are a few exceptions.  They taste bland and have a lot of salt.  Yuk!I added some fresh items to this lo mein to make it palatable. And...to my surprise it was good especially the black bean sauce!I made egg noodles using a touch of baking soda this time to see if I liked the extra springiness that resulted.  I did.The stir fry consisted of fresh onions garlic and ginger and canned mushrooms chop suey vegetables mini sweet corn bamboo shoots and cabbage.  I drained and rinsed all canned veggies.For the black bean sauce  I sauteed chopped onion garlic and ginger in vegetable oil until soft.  I rinsed a can of black beans and added them to the pot.  I then blended the mixture while adding rice vinegar soy sauce sesame seed oil and chili oil to taste.I boiled the fresh noodles for one minute.I grilled some baby bok choy and oyster mushrooms for garnish.To assemble  I added the noodles to the stir fry pan and drizzled with the black bean sauce.  I plated the noodles and the stir fry veggies together.  I topped the dish with the grilled bok choy the grilled mushrooms fresh sprouts and sesame seed.Album  Edit  Bonus pic for my husband who will not eat a meal without meat... homemade Chinese sticky ribs!!  ,52weeksofcooking,d0hfybx,2,t5_2t4i2

7292228,0,t3_4f9ugr,Root to stem is all about frugality and limiting waste. The first of the summer corn was on sale as well as pork shoulder so I decided to make tamales. I braised the pork shoulder in a warm oven for four hours. The meat was shredded and reserved the rendered fat was put in the fridge to harden up and the pork bone was transfered to a stock pot. I shucked a few ears of fresh corn reserving the fresh corn leaves for tamal wrappers. The corn was grilled and cut from the cob. The cob was transfered to a stock pot with the pork bone along with enough water to cover everything. I simmered the stock for several hours and then strained away the solids leaving about five cups corny pork stock.I made a simple green salsa out of tomatillos cilantro garlic roast poblanos and lime zest and juice. Half the salsa was combined with some grilled corn and the shredded meat to form the tamal filling.I whipped the hardened lard for about  minutes until light and airy like a buttercream folded in masa harina corn meal baking powder and salt then added my corny pork broth. The fresh corn leaves were simmered for  minutes. Then I assembled the tamales and steamed for  minutes. I dressed the tamales with green salsa corn and cilantro.The only bits and pieces I did not use were the poblano stems and tomatillo stems and skins as well as a few bits of the corn leaves which were dried up moldy andor torn to bits. Overall these were a success. However I wish I would have gotten a higher proportion of fillingmasa and I ended up with too much masa and filling for the number of corn leaf wrappers.,52weeksofcooking,d272smc,1,t5_2t4i2

8771136,0,t3_508nki,For this weeks dish I wanted to make the signature dish of a chef who makes delicious Israeli food Yotam Ottolenghi.  According to Wikipedia one of his signatures is roasted butternut squash with tahini and zatar and the picture of the dish looked incredibly appetizing.  It was kind of similar to a zucchini dish we made from Zahav as a matter of fact.  The squash didnt have the sweetness that I was expecting but the tahinizatar combo was very tasty and complemented the roasted squash flavor.For my MetaTheme I first tried to find a signature drink of a famous mixologist or bartender but couldnt really find anything.  Instead I opted for a popular drink which was famous in its own right a White Russian  It was made famous by its prominent spot in the Big Lebowski and is one of the most popular drinks out there now.  I went with my standard  ratio and it was delicious and creamy.,52weeksofcooking,d7222t1,2,t5_2t4i2

I then took what seemed like a common dish of baked bananas and turned that into the filling bananas honey nutmeg cinnamon and salt.

11321251,0,t3_61kogs,My university cafeteria would let us pack our meals in takeout boxes and I would refrigerate andor freeze ingredients to cook in the dorm. I would microwave tortillas shredded cheddar cheese and beef to make a quesadilla. Lots of other additions possible onions chicken bacon etc.Microwave quesadillas are soggy! I tried to recreate my microwave method from my university days and didnt like the dampness. I had to put it on a nonstick pan for a while just to dry it up.also this movie was released a year before I attended university make yourself a dang quesadilla!,52weeksofcooking,dff8tnb,3,t5_2t4i2

11498178,0,t1_dfzakcf, might be slightly over baked but I love the crunch and it has no burnt taste isnt dry inside I probably will think about adding more ingredients next time because its almost more like cornbread with sausage than a cassarole lol,52weeksofcooking,dfzbgpo,2,t5_2t4i2

11614893,0,t3_65rbm5,I was pretty excited to make these because a lot of my ancestors are Cornish. Unfortunately they were kind of a fail and I didnt like them.They were falling apart when they came out of the oven like the dough was flimsy and not holding them together well enough. When I transferred them to the plate they were completely undone. And then they were extremely dry. They were like some kind of fucked up chicken pot pie but with different ingredients.I wanted to make a side with this but the good people over at rcornwall informed me that no sides are necessary. I think if I had made a gravy and poured it over it it would have helped with some of the dryness though.Recipe Instead of leeks and parsnips I used a turnip. That was fun I had never cooked with a turnip before.,52weeksofcooking,dgck3uf,4,t5_2t4i2

11800581,0,t3_68djp6,TBH I kinda phoned this in this week. I had plans to veganize Salisbury steak but totally forgot so I made pudding instead. This is a vegan version made with a can of evaporated coconut milk instead of cow milk. Tastes good but more like a caramel sauce than a pudding. Well see how it is after more time to set. At the least itll be a good ice cream topping!Edit much yummier and more puddinglike after chilling overnight. ,52weeksofcooking,dgxmxiy,1,t5_2t4i2
