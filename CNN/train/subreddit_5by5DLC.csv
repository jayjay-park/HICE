2289940,0,t1_cluqstd,oh dear lol. A few years ago i kept a todo list of games to complete. Since steam sales became quite often as well as humble bundles i stopped doing it. Was too anxious. I remember keeping track of red dead redemption force unleashed  a splinter cell game and some others. Bleh lol.For now just trying to get further through shadows of mordor AC  as mentioned and want to play a few indie games that i have as well. Some i just have in my steam list but will likely never play as im not interested in them. Not all games in a bundle interest me but some do etc.Really though i have a good feel of Black Flag so im in no rush. Have a good  hrs in so far.,5by5DLC,clur43i,1,t5_31gnk
2485606,0,t3_2o1vw0,I learned to love that game after I turned the difficulty all the way down to casual.  Otherwise it was just exercises in frustration.  After that I loved the story and the characters but it was more of a digital experience then the game that I assume bioware intended.,5by5DLC,cmj09k7,2,t5_31gnk

3353526,0,t1_cp9sk46,Initially I was very excited for the prospect of Steam Machines.  I would very much like to play games only available on PC but absolutely do not want to deal with all the issues of owning a PC.  I want a PC that just works like a console.  The reason I got out of PC gaming in the s was the hours I spent troubleshooting just to make the game function.  Im sure some things have improved but my gaming time is precious and I dont want to waste any of it not actually playing games.When these were first announced everyone was asking who are these for?  Well the answer was me  Someone who owns a console but doesnt have a PC or a desire to build one. However with the fracturing and nonstandardization they arent even for me anymore.,5by5DLC,cpaiyui,1,t5_31gnk

7619597,0,t3_4jmnd9,Id seen an article guessing that the ps neo and the nx might get announced at tgs which made me wonder if theyd be connected or if the nx would be a vita like system for the neo..

9094160,0,t1_d84u8fc,Its a pretty charged accusation though. I would prefer there being some sort of evidence before branding a label like that. I think its also easy to surround yourself in a linkminded community and lump people who dont share your views all into the same group.,5by5DLC,d84z0ca,1,t5_31gnk
