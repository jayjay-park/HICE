6044568,0,t1_cybxser,I think it might work if we made something like a secondary book  maybe once a month or every other week that will be a different genre than that months genre.That way people who arent interested in that months genre will have something else to read and the sub wont be completely split in two because the secondary book will be swapped less often.do you think this compromise might work? P.S I would love if one of the mods would come here and share their opinion on the matter.,52in52,cyby7ym,1,t5_3bid8

I agree that not knowing everything the book references didnt hinder being able to follow along or enjoying the book. I was an s baby but our first video game was SNES with Super Mario Brothers I think whichever one had Yoshi for the first time and I didnt get into video games until my s and even then it was a  random thing but I really enjoyed it and am trying to convince my husband to read it but hes not biting yet ,52in52,cym6n9t,1,t5_3bid8

6168384,0,t1_cyqlg4l,The Iliad Odyssey or the Aeneid isnt well over  pages.  My version of the Iliad is  pages and a lot of those extra pages is just an introduction and notes.  The Aeneid is shorter  mines  pages with an introduction.  Then there are the many plays of Aeschylus Euripides and Sophocles some of the greatest literature ever produced which one can read through in a night.  Theres the poetry of an Ovid Catullus Horace which is still incredible to read even in the modern period.  Not even Platonic dialogues are that long some of them being under  pages and the longer ones such as the Republic dont really push that  either.I feel that some people probably voted for books that theyd heard of rather than necessarily voting for more enriching things.  Its a damn shame that no book from the Classical period was able to make it despite the wealth of that periods literature and its undeniable quality.  Some thing like The Man in the High Castle or Lolita which Im sure is decent book doesnt even come close to the Aeneid.Ill keep reading though.,52in52,cyqs54j,3,t5_3bid8

6231570,0,t3_40xsm0,I have really mixed feelings about this book. On one had I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the book. However the jargon and the constant explaining of concepts that simply held no interest to me really made the book a boring and dragged on read. Some of you had made this comment about how its almost like a textbook disguised in a narrative form. Another problem that I had was for the large majority of the book there was absolutely no tension or conflict. There was a bit in the beginning prior to knowing the Nautilus was a submarine and maybe bits scattered through the middle regarding Captain Nemos true identity and their attempts to escape. Aside from that its more or less like reading a diary its not really a page turner...I feel that this book could have been a lot better had they maybe skipped or only grazed the specific details regarding all the fish plants etc. Almost every other chapter some obscure plant would be told to the reader down to its very specifics and not going to lie I usually just skimmed through these parts.Nonetheless the world created was quite astounding. I think it could have been better but looking back at it I only really remember the parts that were enjoyable and really interesting. Its kind of like going on a very long journey and coming back from it. You dont remember the long plane flights or bus rides but you do remember the actual destinations and such. tldrDid I enjoy this book?Honestly no.Am I happy that I experienced it and finished it?Yes,52in52,cyxymg8,9,t5_3bid8
6239285,0,t1_cyytw04,It is a great book to read together! I love reading with my husband too! You really spend the whole time wondering if the main character can accomplish what he has set out to do. You start to wonder about why he includes so much detail but in the end it is to show how much time has passed and what it means to the main character. It is light on science fiction and the supernatural and is much more focused on the human aspect of the story.I really enjoyed it. They are making it into a mini series with James Franco.

6389739,0,t3_434ud4,gt We believe that ones sex should not be a determining factor when suggesting AND upvoting a book. Doing so is a bias action.   Im okay with you not wanting to do womens literature as a topic. Im okay with you not wanting to do any minority literature as a topic. Its your sub and you can run it how you want.Im not okay with the causal bigotry of suggesting these are not genres or culturally important enough to separate out.This is the exact opinion of white male editors for generations that kept out women and people of color from even publishing books and caused them to create their own style culture and genre.Women and Minority authors have been having a conversation with each for a long time that men tend to ignore or denigrate. Congratulations on continuing this tradition. Yours is a bias action.,52in52,czfy3yt,13,t5_3bid8

But then the lack of actual discussion and the fact that Ive read PB and Dorian Grey drove me to reading my own choice of books.  I did try and participate in any discussions started but they quickly petered out  the bulk ended up being just reviews I am guilty of this as well so not really blaming anyone.

6495825,0,t3_44ay3s,I read this one last week for library reasons.The writing style was hard to get into and understand. Lots of Nazi era references were lost on me in addition to philosophical musings. I watched the first episode of the series thinking that maybe it would help me get the feel for the characters and follow along better but apparently they are quite different. I felt like a whole lot of nothing happened and I really dont think I understood the ending. The premise sounded so fascinating but the book didnt really deliver what I was expecting I guess. Maybe some of the end of book discussion here will help enlighten me on what I missed.,52in52,czr7so4,4,t5_3bid8

There are passages in there by Nabocov that are pure beauty enough to make me schedule more time to read his other stuff.But in the latter rd I felt he dropped the ball I got bored and it became very hard to keep going in part because the subject matter was so horrible.  If you are already reading and like the writing at all try substituting with something else by him. Or just choose another book.  If you have just started theres no point in wasting hours of your time reading something you cannot stand.  Pick another book from the list or go to the what else are you reading? and pick a book someone else is reading there are some really good ones I noticed.,52in52,d0bjndb,1,t5_3bid8

As an atheist I could say that all religious texts are shameless lies... I would like to think they are lies with the intention of creating good although some would argue that is impossible in and of itself. As a child I was taught that I shouldnt lie steal murder etc. because God proclaimed that to be so on Mount Sinai. As an adult I see that as a fabrication of a story with a moral that holds true. I shouldnt break the  commandments okay  of them but not because God said so rather because it is the best way for us humans to respect and uphold one another.,52in52,d0dwzyl,5,t5_3bid8
