Flying every other minute you are still averaging mph with a x mile range before you need to recharge.  Very nice combination!,6Perks,dc7upuz,4,t5_3f9x5

10848293,0,t3_5rxbda,ByteSize Time Travel Telekinetic Serendipity and the free Minor Limited Precognition.So heres how Im going to do this. Telekinetic Serendipity is constantly in use. If I receive an unfavorable message I immediately kill myself. Since Telekinetic Serendipity is constantly in use influencing the chain of events leading to me receiving that message and killing myself I will get the warning one year earlier that this use of my powers will lead to my death within one year prompting me to try a different course of action.I only need one killmyself message so Ill encode that as FF FF all ones and use the rest for relaying information normally.At this point the most important thing to ensure reliability is to ensure that I successfully kill myself without fail. This probably involves something like implanting a bomb in my head. Ill make it faildeadly so that breaking or losing the remote such that I cant activate it manually will also activate it especially since otherwise Telekinetic Serendipity would probably break the remote every time.So basically the result of this is that instead of just receiving whatever  bits I send back every so often I also continuously receive  bit telling me whether this course of action will go well in the long term. Theoretically this will never actually happen because Telekinetic Serendipity will foresee my getting the warning and nudge me towards a path I would eventually accept immediately. The message will be sent back to a bit under one year after the best time to avert the unfavorable path with Telekinetic Serendipity in mind possibly guaranteed by my simulated future selfs own version of this setup but this is getting too twisty for me to easily figure out whether that would work.So the end result is basically a really longterm version of Telekinetic Serendipity. Or maybe a janky hackedtogether version of Path to Victory. Wow I munchkind so hard I made Path to Victory.,6Perks,ddyxbar,1,t5_3f9x5
