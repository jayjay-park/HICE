5770818,0,t3_3u6hyf,Firstly I recommend Dan Savages Lovecast for general relationship and sex advice. My personal experience is that some things when discussed in the cold light of day and when youre both not aroused are just nogo areas with some people. But wait to bring up the idea when youre both aroused and in the heat of the moment and the same idea could get a much more positive response. One way of approaching it is to suggest the idea in the third person again during foreplay ie some girls like to call their bf daddy but I dont know how I feel about it... What do you think... Daddy...?A common massive misunderstanding here is that people think youre talking about YOUR daddy. Youre not presumably. Youre employing an archetype to tickle a specific part of your fancy. Good luck!  ,40Plus,cxcf94u,2,t5_2r7qx
