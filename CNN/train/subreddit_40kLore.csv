2733187,0,t3_2oxce3,read the book a while ago so my recollection might not be accurate. From what I recall Telachs suffering was more brought on by the Iron Hands attitude than the warp itself. In other chapters librarians try not to overexert themselves and have maintain a limit how much warp force they access. IH despise any signs of weakness be it physical or mental.

3163402,0,t1_co9d7jz,A Thousand Sons by Graham McNeill an awesome read and one of my favourites from the entire series. There is a section in the book where Magnus is talking to one of his brothers shortly before  during the parade at Ullanor. To one of them Mortarion Magnus says A great day is it not? Nine sons of the Emperor gathered together on one world such a thing has not happened since... I know well when it was Magnus and the Emperor forbade us to speak of it again. A little later Mortarion says to Magnus I knew a being like you once before. So sure in his powers so convinced of his superiority that he could not see his doom until it was upon him. Like you he wielded dark powers. Our father made him pay with his life for such evil. Have a care you do not suffer the same fate.Throughout the book there is much made of the imagery of the wolf as a threatening figure and the bringer of doom. I seem to recall it is warned that unless things change the Emperor will send his Wolf once again by one of the Primarchs to Magnus maybe Sanguinius.,40kLore,copvvnr,1,t5_2zdqr

4685925,0,t1_ctl71sp,I recall reading somewhere that the original three Chaos gods at least initially embodied more positive aspects and emotions. Over time though negative emotions resonate more powerfully in the Warp and resulted in Khorne Tzeentch and Nurgle twisting into their current forms. That said from time to time these Chaos gods still display their original positive traits such as Khorne occasionally having champions that are valourous and honourable in combat rather than just insane berserkers.Regarding the Emperor its still kinda up for debate. Some say that hes not truly a Warp entity on par with the Chaos gods until he dies and hes just an extremely powerful but still mortal psyker sitting on the Golden Throne. However considering the last time that a god of the Warp was born resulted in the creation of the Eye of Terror if the Emperor does ascend a new Warp storm centred on Terra is definitely possible even if hes notionally good. ,40kLore,ctl7fcn,4,t5_2zdqr

5193430,0,t3_3m4jko,I dont really know of anything that could cause in the current Imperium a chaos god to suddenly bite the dust. All of the big  get their power from human emotions. So it would take the disappearance of an entire emotionreaction for a chaos god to die. Like if disease and fear of disease were suddenly abolished then Nuggle would have a pretty hard time. However even if the Imperium was for example able to remove disease remove despair lethargy and the fear of mortality entirely from the empire Nuggles followers daemons would work at nothing but to spread some unknown disease  fear throughout the Imperium. The followers of the Chaos gods primary purpose is to make their master stronger by whatever does that like korne followers spilling blood and collecting bones.That being said if one of the chaos Gods were to die then it would probably be a very slow process. Their primary source of power would be wittled away so they could no longer become stronger and their followers would also get weaker specifically their daemons because their power is just a sliver of their masters power. So if their master were to do they would go along with it. For all the humans that are just mutated from their chaos god I think they would probably keep their mutations but no longer have a will convulsion to keep following what their master wanted them to do. But then again that probably wouldnt happen because they would keep doing what made their chaos master stronger thus giving him more strength.The only real death of a warp god that we know of in war is that of the eldar gods when slannesh consumed the majority of them. However this came about because the eldars presence of being alive gave the eldar gods their power but when slannesh came about and consumed the majority of their homeworlds a majority of their population also disappeared leaving the gods weakened. So theoritically if another Choas god opposite to the Chaos were created like ltredacted by the Ordo Malleusgt then a death of a Chaos god might be possible.

When they became one Order under the Lion and later a Legion they maintained their previous structures. Basically old orders became chapters and the chapter masters formed a sort of suborder under the direct command of the lion. When the heresy happened and the codex came around they quietly split their already existing chapters into codex chapters but kept the secret Inner Circle structure intact.

Major plot points yes and if you consider that spoilers then you probably shouldnt read this I guessThe Ultramarines totally did it to Captain Uriel Ventris and his sergeantbest friendbroforlife Pasanius. At the end of the Tarsis Ultra campaign Uriel turned command of his company over to his sergeantsa serious breach of Codex doctrinesto lead a Deathwatch mission with Pasanius at his side to assassinate the Tyranid queen on her hive ship. The mission was successful and it stopped the Tyranid invasion of Tarsis Ultra but when Uriel and Pasanius returned they were exiled from the Ultramarines for breaching the Codex. They were given a Death Oath the only way for them to be returned to their chapter would be if they successfully completed what was basically a suicide mission into the Eye of Terror and returned alive. Which as you can guess since theres more than two books in the first Ultramarines Omnibus they do.But during their exile they were considered renegades. They could not return to the Imperium until they fulfilled their Death Oath and were inspected by the Grey Knights to ensure they had no Chaos taint. Even when returned to their chapter they still had to prove themselves to most of the Ultramarines all over again.And they encountered other renegades while in the Eye not all of whom were especially Chaotic. Many of them were exiled for reasons other than worshiping Chaos.Basically there are a number of reasons that a Space Marine might be exiled and thus be counted a renegade.

Luther found out that the Lion was actually hanging back in reserve to find out who would win at Terra and then join the victors. When the Lions forces returned to Calaban Luther and his loyalists attacked the Primarch in a desperate bid to end the traitor. The Lion was defeated however Calaban was destroyed by warp storms Luthers Emperor Loyal forces were scattered and the Lions legion claimed victory. The Victors write the history books. The Remaining Dark Angels who were a hairs breath away from joining with the other traitor legions with their Primarch had they been victorious on Terra now completely surrounded by imperial space branded Luther and his forces traitors and not wanting to be completely annihilated by the vengeful and furious Loyalist Astartes decided to continue to proclaim their allegiance to the Imperium of Man.

Each Phoenix Lord is a founder of a particular style i.e. Shrine  of combat but the Phoenix Lords themselves were formed after the Fall. The Eldar were fighting wars long before the Phoenix Lords came along the latter likely just standardized  the different styles. The Warp spiders and other Aspect Warriors with no Phoenix Lord is likely descended from prePhoenix Lord combat styles. It should also be noted that despite this standardization no two Aspect Shrines descended of the same Phoenix Lords are ever alike. Some might be purer versions than others while others may incorporate different techniques andor weapons. The individual Aspect Shrines themselves will in fact have names differing from their Phoenix Lords Shrine. This is simply due to the passage of time and circumstances. ,40kLore,d11wk9u,9,t5_2zdqr

Horus Heresy breaks out and the Lion learns of it around the end of Isstvan  massacre. He is stuck having to completely abandon his current op which would take months.He then goes on to fight the Thramas Crusade against the Night Lords. They killed a fourth of the whole legion huge damage. They are stuck because of the Ruinstorm so they have to go to Ultramar with Guilliman and wait it out.

The Living Saints are infused with the Will and Might of the Emperor who is divine or almost divine being. But they are not totally enslaved and warped monsters that are proper daemon princes.

7455147,0,t1_d2oj9j2,To be fair complexity can create some things you wouldnt expect. Think of a computer. Exceptionally complex hardware and code combinations give rise to the singular experience of the OS. Likewise our own brains both physically and psychologically made up of many disparate parts put together in very complex ways give rise to the singular entity that observes ourselves identifies as a self and experiences reading these posts.In this same vein the tyranid hive mind could very well be a self reflective selfidentifying nonphysical entity comprised of the countless minds of the tyranid race. Its even in the name of synapse creatures the connecting points of the individual neurons of the greater mind that is the hivemind much like in our brains. This is backed up by a short story published in a collection around the time that Into the Maelstrom was published not sure if it was in that collection or another  but it was a long time ago. A psyker winds up making contact with the tyranid amalgamation and sensing a vast consciousness behind the cacophony of smaller voices. But for all I know thats been retconned or simply forgotten about by GW. Still thats how I think of the hivemind and your description of what causes the shadow in the warp is more or less on point. I dont think the hive mind has emotions or intentions wed recognize as such since it is so utterly alien but it is self aware. Hence killing synapse creatures weakens the metabrains connections at least in the local area.,40kLore,d2plpsw,2,t5_2zdqr

7616277,0,t1_d37x31b,Alright thenThe Emperor eventually promotes Horus to be the Warmaster a st among equals amongst the Primarchs to lead the Great Crusade to go and lead a project back on Earth. Horus eventually succumbs to the influence of a group of Warp entities known collectively as the Gods of Chaos. Through their agents they eventually convince Horus to rebel against the Emperor leading  of the  active Space Marine Legions Luna WolvesSons of Horus Alpha Legion World Eaters Word Bearers Thousand Sons Death Guard Emperors Children Night Lords and Iron Warriors in rebellion against the Emperor dont worry about the two missing Legions thats another weird story in its entirety as well as about half of the rest of the Imperium. Its a massive civil war.Horus through some good maneuvering manages to besiege Earth vastly outnumbering the loyalists there. After a really long siege that essentially destroys Earth Horus essentially runs out of time before reinforcements show up for the Emperor. As a result he taunts the Emperor and goads him into fighting him directly as an allornothing gambit. The Emperor takes the bait and essentially tries to get Horus to see reason but Horus who is essentially being buffed by all  Chaos Gods goes all out and essentially allbutkills the Emperor. Finally seeing reason the Emperor uses his psychic abilities to outright kill Horus before kindof dying. In order to keep the Emperor from dying and in doing so keeping the Imperiums most vital systems from falling apart the Imperium plugs the Emperors corpse still housing his spirit into an artifact known as the Golden Throne essentially using him as a psychic battery. However the Emperor cant really communicate so the control of the Imperium falls to figureheads.Cont in a bit...So at this point the remaining loyalists start freaking out trying to prevent the HH from happening again. They eventually decide to break up the Legions into Chapters each numbering about  men each to ensure that no one Space Marine ever has enough power to do what Horus tried. This almost causes another civil war but eventually everyone agrees and the Space Marines go about pacifying the Imperium and rebuilding after the Heresy which affected everything but was centered on the events at Terra.Meanwhile the traitors who survive Earth book it to the Eye of Terror a massive region of the galaxy where the Warp flows out into real space and so is a safehaven for them under the protection of their Gods. Those legions eventually break up into various warbands each vying for power and favor from the Gods while the surviving traitor primarchs ascend to Daemonhood becoming evil avatars of the Gods themselves. Abaddon Horus st Captain eventually becomes the new effective head of the traitors leading the Luna WolvesSons of Horus which are henceforth the Black Legion. Abaddon leads successive raids and crusades into the Imperium amassing his own personal power to the degree that as of M he basically outranks the Primarchs in the eyes of the Chaos Gods and is their most favored mortal servant.Over the k years in between the Heresy and M the Imperium gradually starts to buckle under the weight of having to fight off the Traitor Legions and their Daemonic allies wellknown alien enemies in the form of the Orks and the Eldar new threats from the Tyranids Tau and Necrons as well as threats from within in the form of mutants heretics pirates and other renegades and rebels. All the while the Golden Throne which is basically the only thing keeping the Imperium together is gradually failing and the Emperors spirit is slowly starting to dissipate into the Warp while the enemies of mankind circle like sharks.And then M happens everything is implied to start to really go to shit and the storyline essentially ends deliberately unfinished.Edit Thanks for the gold!,40kLore,d37xj11,24,t5_2zdqr

Your link is pretty much irrelevant.Literally all a DCA is is a member of a crazy cult that thinks they have a blood debt to a certain God which sometimes is Khorne sometimes is the Emperor so they kill the shit out of everything with close combat weapons to repay their blood debt. Is a Dark Eldar also symbolism for love because they wear tight revealing clothing in some of the art? No thats silly.

Thousands of them poisoned themselves and sped their souls to the warp at the same time.

Besides love creates babies and babies grow to become valuable assets to the Ministorum Guard or Administratus.

8360338,0,t1_d5mencd,Yeah theres almost  years of material by now  I suppose its only natural that we limit ourselves to what speaks most to our preferred interpretation of the setting which probably also depends a lot on which of these books we grew up with.Faction preferences are another factor but when Im having a hard time finding good fiction for the armies that interest me most Im simply gravitating to other IPs. In a way I might feel a bit left behind in terms of support so maybe a reluctance to buy into other novels could be partially based on a grudge too in addition to just having a lot of other interesting things to choose from elsewhere.I did take a look at some of the Imperial Armour books years ago though and found the Siege of Vraks one to be an interesting read in terms of exposition and design  but the apparent contradictions with codex fluff still make me see them in a different light. I guess its just because as Forgeworld products they come from a different team of authors.This sort of exposure explains how the two of us can arrive at such very different interpretations of the same setting but Im sure personal preferences in storytelling are an influence too. For example I could never get into superhero comics Batman gt Superman brains over super powers etc.Anyhow thank you for the exchange!

8436187,0,t1_d5w18uz,Awesome work! Although regarding Lorgar Emperor Aurelian seemed to me as the basis for his inspiration due to the following reasons taken from article linked above just wanted to pick a few to present the casegt When Claudius died his brother Quintillus seized power with support of the Senate. With an act typical of the Crisis of the Third Century the army refused to recognize the new Emperor preferring to support one of its own commanders Aurelian was proclaimed emperor in September  by the legions in Sirmium. Aurelian defeated Quintillus troops and was recognized as Emperor by the Senate after Quintillus death. The claim that Aurelian was chosen by Claudius on his death bed can be dismissed as propaganda later probably in  Aurelian put his own dies imperii the day of Claudius death thus implicitly considering Quintillus a usurper.gt Aurelian was a military commander and during his reign he tried to keep legions fidelity this coin celebrated the CONCORDIA MILITVM concord of the soldiers  in other words harmony between the emperor and the military.gt Asia Minor was recovered easily every city but Byzantium and Tyana surrendered to him with little resistance. The fall of Tyana lent itself to a legend Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him but he spared Tyana after having a vision of the great stcentury philosopher Apollonius of Tyana whom he respected greatly in a dream.gt Apollonius implored him stating Aurelian if you desire to rule abstain from the blood of the innocent! Aurelian if you will conquer be merciful! Whatever the reason Aurelian spared Tyana. It paid off many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the Emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Within six months his armies stood at the gates of Palmyra which surrendered when Zenobia tried to flee to the Sassanid Empire. The Palmyrene Empire was no more.,40kLore,d5w29zf,3,t5_2zdqr

8643984,0,t1_d6lrvy8,Did you know I was once as innocent as you? Oh yes once I was ignorant of the beauty of this world. There was a time I didnt know of the glorious ecstasy one could find. My memories were broken when I joined the Blood Ravens part of their indoctrination process. I remember some things from before when i was small and innocent. When i was very young my father got me a job as a assistant at a bar in my block. I did little things fetch supplies deliver notices silly things. I remember the day I found this beautiful device it had glistening silver lines that ran from the head to the base. I stared at it for hours at a time It was perfect. The owner of the bar one day while i was lost in its beauty saw how enthralled I was with the device and told me of it how to pluck the cords and bring those wondrous sounds to life. Ahh how I remember those days He gave me permission to play with the artifact as long as the work was done. Weeks passed and every day after work I would sit quietly playing with that instrument I let my fingers sing to me in the only way they could. The sounds they were capable of bringing forth could make any day go from a grey blur to the most vibrant of hues. It wasnt long until I realized I had a audience It grew each day and filled me with such joy. These poor fools had never heard such sounds before their dark lives filled with nothing but the sound of metal on metal and violence was now graced with a beauty only I was capable of making. I could have lived my entire life there with that instrument and never would I have felt empty or unfulfilled.Alas that was not the fate the ones who hide behind the veil. On a day just like any other I went about my normal routine. I woke up happy knowing my day would be filled with such a bliss. I arrived at the bar my second home and was told that they needed me to go down to the next block and fetch some supplied. That man saved my life that day intentional or not he allowed me to continue on to where I am today. I returned with the supplied to see the entire street in a panic and flames. Three men stood outside wearing dark coats with red marking on them In a instant my heart sank my home was gone. I approached one of the man and was instantly met with a bolter to the face. He yelled at me stay away child this area is off limits to all citizens. The authority in his voice If he had pulled that on me now I would have crushed his head in my hand But I was a child. I ran. As i fled I heard one of the others utter the one who caused the problems is missing I knew it in my core he was speaking of me. I ran home as fast as my legs could carry me. It was not fast enough They beat me home and burned it to ash.. Weeks passed and i hid in the sewers and lower levels like a rat That was until the day a Monster of a man found me. He spoke of the potential in me and ferried me back to their monastery. In a month my life went from perfecting to war I fought other children. All my anger at those inquisitors I unleashed on them but no matter how much of their blood i spilled or bones i broke my anger would not be sated my fury would smolder into a festering rage and then into a explosive force. One of the Librarian emerged from the shadows and instantly shackled me with a strange device I blacked out. I was told when I awoke of the dangers of what I was A conduit to the Darkness that lies behind the curtain I was a threat to everything around me and I was to be tested.And so they tested me they tried to break me tried to wear me down they tried to force me to become a liability something to be purged. They failed I focused my rage into drive I willed myself to grow stronger I would not forget the my past That maybe one day I would be able to hear those sounds again What I fool I was.. Years would pass I was implanted with the Gene Seed of a Blood Angel. Months turned to years and years to decades I dont know how long it took but I started to forget my family was the first the bar followed and then the harmony and sounds I had come to know sank into a inky blackness. I was a Angel of Death now. This was my life none would stand in the way of my fury.Decades would pass Promotions would be had and I would eventually grow into a unstoppable juggernaut filled with the Holy Righteousness of what I thought was just. I may have continued that way as well... Strange now that I think of it are we just creatures bound by the whims of fate? aloft and unable to control which way we flow? No matter what we do or how hard we try to see and grab the strings they are forever out of our reach. Are we just puppets that someone forces to dance to their whims?Nerudomu. Have you heard of it? Its a back water little planet in the Segmentum Sector. It held no valuable materials it did not provide food stock It was a horrible little rock with nothing redeeming to the Imperium. To me however It would be the location were i found my freedom my escape from the world I was told would be my life. It would be my salvation from life I did not want. My company was sent to the planet and I with it to safe guard them. A Chaos Warband was sighted in the sector and was making a staging ground on the planet. I had fought many Chaos Marines up until that point but these ones were different their very presence boomed and echoed through the land. They used strange weapons I had never seen they erupted with noise at first but then I saw it I heard it.. I felt it for the first time since i was a child. It was music it was not the same music i knew it was different. It was loud It was fast and chaotic. But it was beautiful. I froze amidst the battlefield I was awe struck I thought I had forgot this feeling. I was a Angel of War now I should feel this anymore. A scream brought me back from that bliss and I remembered my duty. I had lost six brothers in that single moment and the warband lost so much more. I roared and energy flowed through my being and into the Noise Marines They screamed out in pain and fell one by one. I fried them in their own profane armor.

8724379,0,t3_4zdlwp,Chapter Star WardensParent Thousand Sons kept secret to the public they stem from the Blood AngelsAffiliation LoyalistColors Black white trim constellation patterns denoting company specialty and rank.The Star Wardens are a fleet based chapter with a nearly psychotic compulsion to travel and explore the galaxy. They specialize in small unit surgical strikes but they also seem to have an uncanny knack for being around worlds when surprise xeno or chaos attacks are launched and having forces in place. They are especially uncanny in their ability to thwart attacks that would have great ripple effects on the galaxy like establishing a foothold for a campaign or destroying an important resource.To the public at large the wardens are a successor to the Blood Angels and their otherworldly grace and ferocity seem too support this. In truth though they spring from the Thousand Sons and they manifest the heavy concentration of psykers and the compulsive hoarding of knowledge you would expect from them.Tactical Doctrine The Wardens make heavy use of their consulars librarians to anticipate the flow of battles and prepare accordingly. They assemble and kit out squads on a mission by mission basis. Their actual combat tactics rely on guerilla warfare with small squads or fireteams spreading out to harry sabotage and ambush. They also make extensive use of consulars to maintain maximum tactical flexibility. In keeping with the official story of their blood Angel heritage they have a huge focus on melee combat and maintaining constant vigilance to keep their emotions in check. Unfortunately their reliance of preparation and foresight leave them struggling to catch up when theyre wrong. Their adherence to their own internal code in addition to being somewhat codex compliant can lead them to make wasteful choices or avoid intervening until a problem becomes much worse.Due to a combination of their above average number of tech marines close ties to the mechanicum and exploration they are able to equip most marines with a weapon unique to their chapter a power sword infused with plasma that produces a glowing blade that hums through the air can cut almost anything and when used in conjunction with a consulars heightened reflexes allows a marine to deflect energy projectiles.Mutations Aside from producing a large number of psykers the wardens also have the unusual ability to produce their own astropaths. Psykers also frequently become able to use their mental abilities to heighten their physical ability granting them primarch like speed coordination and reflexes for brief periods. Some consulars claim to be able to anticipate enemy attacks but this remains unverified.Chapter Quirks Company captains are called masters and also act as chaplains sergeants are knights and also act as techmarines librarians are consulars apothecaries are sentinels. Respected veterans in terminator armor are often referred to as guardians. They also typically modify their armor to allow increased mobility and speed at the expense of a little protection.Design Constellations for everything. Each company is named for a zodiac sign their insignia is the corresponding constellation instead of Roman numerals meaning they operate as  companies of . Scouts are denoted by the Orion sign devastators are ursa major assault are cannis major tactical are the pegasus consulars are circinus sentinels are furnax.

Magnus was way over his head but it was Russ prejudice hypocracy and and lack of insight in his own misconceptions that lead to the catastrophe in the end.       I agree and canon seems so as well.     As above or is there something more recent that points to the contrary? I took it away from the short stories that the Lion was distrusting his brothers after the thing with Pertuabo. But he seemed tobe entirely loyal though a bit misguided in some actions.

Guardsmen might be straight forward but given how cover based combat becomes after th century I dont know if CA is equipped or even capable of making a game feel visceral satisfying and balanced with that kind of combat. And then you have the problem of scaling down Space marines to  man squads and having them being easy to identify easy to manipulate and having them be effective despite their entire thing being surgical and tactical approaches. Map balance as is is also pretty banal and basic and balancing in Warhammer TWs maps is lacking. If they tackled it like Eugen Systems did in Wargames it might work.

For one we have a pretty good understanding of what happens to souls in the warp and humans cannot maintain their consciousness as a soul all of that torture would be worthless.Another reason is that I doubt random things exist in the warp as a physical parody that would be a massive waste of energy. Mental images and reflections of ideas are all possible as physical interpretations by fleshbound mortals. That is to say when a physical brain attempts to interact with the warp the images produced are of something the brain can understand and that the warp uses in order to elicit emotions out of said meat puppet. All of the imagery surrounding the warp is probably largely based on interactions with physical manifestations in which warp energy alters matter in real space or visions as previously mentioned. Even the chaos gods most likely do not exist as physical entities. The warp is probably a lot more amorphous than we imagine that concept is just very difficult to grasp and literalist lore fanatics have a hard time seeing past their noses most of the time anyways. ,40kLore,d8fpld2,10,t5_2zdqr

Grey Burnished Gold trim Bone details and helm Just my take on what looks good but sadly hasnt too much character. Chapter Tactics and weapons What do we need in contrast to the Angry Marines those savages? Power Books are the only real answer here you heretic! Built by the tireless hands of  faithful who suffered for each and every page these powerful books contain. A new and special one would say almost heretical energy source was found to power these tomes! Such weapons of mass destruction are only powered by the power of GRIMDARK.Chapter personality Obsessed with the collection and internal spreading of ancient lore and devious secrets not to be heard by weak minds since they would crumble before its sheer might. Warcry It depends really. My favorite answer on this sub.Now some actual fluffBound by golden shackles that remind us of our holy duty and terrible curse. Serving mankind by equally collecting ancient and young knowledge. Never can they know what secrets this galaxy holds lest it would destroy them and leave weak minds to insidious whispers. Our hands are forever bound in service to our golden progenitor he who is our distant father.Let fire rain on those who go at lengths to stop us make divine light shine down and illuminate those forced into the dark. We who walk among the stars whose hearts carry the treacherous quest for enlightenment will pry open every last arcane secret for it is our holy duty. Those who stand in our way will crumble beneath our wrath those who stand with us take confidence in earnest camaraderie. Where will you stand Inquisitor?The golden shackles are a symbol towards this chapters duty to collect information new and old bound to the knowledge they uncover as they cannot share it with outsiders. The radiant color symbolising the importance of the Lorewalkers royal quest. However the golden bonds are shackles none the less meaning they are bound to be but slaves to their duty.This chapter embraces the Emperors hunger for knowledge and his will is absolute every member carrying a burning passion for the knowledge this world holds.Naturally such philosophy clashes strongly with that of the current Imperium and from that come countless dealings with the Holy Inquisition. Suprisingly the chapter found support in the Inquisition itself a large group of Inquisitors stood for the preservation and collection of knowledge leading to great infighting between a number of different Ordos. One would think considering the chapters task that detailed records would have been kept however the only information that would be rememberd decades later is that the chapter lives on Inquisitors on both sides were found to be heretics promting countless executions and most records faded into nothingness.  Edit Depending on how fast we achieve a consensus on how the chapter will look like Id try to use the upcoming Burinig of Prospero box for this chapter.Edit Added color scheme and some fluff writing.,40kLore,d8udyu7,2,t5_2zdqr

It hasnt ever been stated precisely.We know thatUpon the extinction of the class of xenoform known as a Norn Queen a psychotemporal event approaching level Gamma  is generated  a level sufficient to temporarily obscure the light of the Astronomican. It is believed that this phenomenon represents the death knell of said xenoform and that its purpose is to trigger those biovessels that intercept the signal to calve. This has been dubbed the Hydra effect for upon the death of one Norn Queen a number of others are calved and thus the advance of the Tyranids is merely slowed not stalled.Thats a pretty powerful thing able to obscure the astronomican. Theyre also the primary synapse node for their fleet which is insane. To be able to project such immutable will across the entire fleet displays truly immense power.Physically they wouldnt be models on the table.

The largest primate in existence is the Silverback which weight around  kilos I think.    The largest agile mammal the grizzly gets to around  kilos. But even then that would be unreasonably large for a human.  more to the point it would be pointless.   Why would you want to get that big or tall?  Especially as we become a spacefaring culture its only a disadvantage to be big.   You need more oxygen more water more food which means more drain on resources.   Being huger doesnt help you fire a railgun any more effectively or pilot a ship or operate EVA gear.   Your mass means the ship has that much less massbudget for takeoff or maneuvers.   If the humans of the Imperium are mostly the descendants of the rediscovered human colonies from the Golden Age then Id expect them to be smaller than us not bigger and intentionally so.    Smaller people means a colony has a less tight food budget per person and so a better chance of surviving.   It means you can build ships with smaller spaces and so cram more in efficiently.

Eating one whatever the hell that means might not do anything unless brains have evolved to interact with souls on some fundamental level. On a rational level eating a soul makes no sense. CTan are masters of the physical universe. They could easily create any variety of things to induce whatever pleasurable sensations they wanted to experience. Experiencing eating a soul has no tangible benefit other than sounding grimdark. It is inherently a silly concept. When I mentioned AI I only meant that nonmeatbags could very well have souls. I dont really see the relevance of most of what youve posted about Necrons. Also the theory that they created blanks is nonsense. The timelines dont fit at all and it is such a peculiar way of going about it that it is hardly worth mentioning. ,40kLore,da8mulw,1,t5_2zdqr

Why wide spectrum?  Im targeting a single species.  That means as soon as I know a single cell wall protein and cell membrane protein those cells need to survive I can target it as a viral attachment point.gtWhat are the delivery methods youd use?Deployed in a high altitude air burst from a torpedo delivered in the systems kyper belt what drifted into the target world on silent running.  Stealth coated of course.  Use a nonpathogenic retro virus so the virus has plenty of time to spread across the Ork population and sterilize them all.gt Would it have any undesirable side effects that might be avoided?Good thing I have an unlimited supply of lab grown orks to test it on isnt it?gt Would it cost anything resources wise to develop and deploy?Yes but far less than countering even a single Waugh.  It would cost about as much to develop as most modern drugs.  In the  billion range and thats if I really really care about minimizing side effects.gtHow effective is the deployment?Depends on the planets atmosphere.  But Id like pick a suitable target world.gtDo you have to spray the subjectscorpses down?No that would be stupid.

I agree and it makes me want to write fanfiction about fem!marines!Not that I really would but I have to get it out of my system anyhow Not really focusing on them doing badass things but how that would affect the geneseed. What if females were affected differently than males upon receiving implants? Example The Blood Angels discovered that woman that are given Sanguinus geneseed though somewhat weaker than their brothers are immune to the Red Thirst and Black Rage making them somewhat valuable. Yes rare but very valuable. How would this effect chapter politics?Would the Ultramarines who ever so value the purity of their seed scorn chapters who desecrated their geneseed? Could this have lead to wars between chapters?Who would even recruit these warriors?Yes weve mentioned the Blood Angels and differing effects on the geneseed but what if there were other reasons for a chapter to open the recruitment to women? Perhaps the Black Templars who are always on the crusade. Always suffering losses. Perhaps they opened the ranks to women in hopes of bolstering their numbers. Even if its a small margin it no less more recruits. Again a lot A LOT of lore would have to change but Id love to see those stories play out. At this point Ive been toying the idea of doing my own original idea featuring these problems. Thats honestly my advice to those who really want fem!marines.

I would then form a plan to infiltrate Nurgles territory to liberate Isha from his imprisonment so she would heal the emperor and be secured within the webway as an ironclad seal on the alliance between the eldar and the imperium. EDIT I forgot all space marine chapters no longer are limited to  marines.  They are limited to  and the legions they originally came from are to be officially recognized by the imperium so in case of a galactic emergency the legions can be reformed temporarily to combat the threat.  Also current chapters that are descended from traitor legions CAN be recognized as long as the entire chapter return to Terra to have their current loyalties tested and those who pass may serve the current imperium as fully integrated astartes.  ,40kLore,dauuvbb,10,t5_2zdqr

10224980,0,t1_dc2rzr4,The Emperor knew that the Eldar were responsible for the creation of Slaanesh and was generally of the opinion that all xenos needed to be wiped out so I believe humanity as a whole has always been at war with the Eldar even if there are some moments of relative cooperation between small hosts of Eldar and small groups of humans. I think Emps knew that the Eldar could  sometimes  be reasoned with so he may have been willing to suspend hostilities with them until he had wiped out the Orks and united humanity. A kill them last policy as it were but still definitely hostile.For their part the Eldar are extremely arrogant and assume that humans are just inherently inferior to them and therefore see no problem wiping out huge numbers of humans to preserve anything of minor importance to the Eldar. Prior to the Heresy I believe certain Eldar leaders were content to try to avoid humans rather than exterminate them but I believe as a species theyve always held the opinion that humanity was going down the same road they were and needed to be stopped.Eldrad did foresee the Heresy and did attempt to warn humanity of it but unfortunately his point of contact for that warning was Fulgrim after Fulgrim had begun to be corrupted. Eldrad attempted to be reasonablediplomatic but still impress on Fulgrim the importance of taking the warning seriously. Of course Fulgrim at this point still couldnt comprehend treason against the Emperor even if hed begun that path himself. Then Eldrad sees the Laeran sword which is a Slaaneshi Daemonblade Fulgrim is wearing realizes hes too late and tries to kill Fulgrim and the others.

10274278,0,t3_5n4nnt,It was not the primarchs that caused the horus heresy it was human nature. It was pride anger hate jealousy arrogance etc. felt by the primarchs that led them to the path that it did. The primarchs were super beings physically but in their mind they were all human just like you and me. They lived incredibly long and had ambitions and vision far greater then the average human but that also amplified their emotions even more. Just look at horuss mental breakdown when he thinks he is going to die. He confesses to his biographer  forgot her name how his brothers never treated him the way he felt he deserved. He talks about how the negative reactions of his brothers affected him  how he had doubts that maby sanguinius would have been the better choice. He is basically just crying his heart out to this woman and bearing it all. The biographer is completely utterly shell shocked not only because a primarch that she thought was immortal is dying but also because she realizes just how human and fragile the demigods are. Horus breaking down is in my opinion the strongest evidence of just how human the primarchs are.These are things the emperor has no control over. If he had normal or technological augmented humans as his generals they too would have revolted maby their revolution would not have carried the strength of Horuss attack but then they would also lack the strength of the primarchs to help battle the enemies of mankind and the various threats that the galaxy had. They could also not conquer worlds in the same way.The space marines exist because of the primarch project. The primarchs were necessary no primarchs no space marines.I think the webway was just a means of safe transportation humans were still going to live in real space. If they lived in real space they would have to face real space threats like the orks tyranids and tau. Humanity needed specialized weapons to complement its already competent imperial forces.,40kLore,dc8n8ha,59,t5_2zdqr

10743877,0,t3_5to77d,Sanguinious has to stay dead as does Horus. Why? Because they are pivotal to the plot. Sanguinius was the most respected primarch of all the loyalists. He wasnt the best in every category but he was decent in everything he did. He knew how to comfort other primarchs and deal with them. They respected him for various reasons.      Horus was the opposite he is what made the chaos rally with him instead of splintering like current CSM. He had power might strength these are things the CSM respect. He knew how to punish people he knew strategy he knew things about the loyalists they did not know about each other.     We could go onto a whole other topic of why loyalist respected Sanguinius and why CSM followed Horus. So lets not do that in this post.     The bottom line is that when Sanguinius died it laid the final nail of hatred toward all CSM for the loyalists while throwing them into disarray. When Horus died it divided the CSM into separate factions and their hatred of loyalists. If either one comes back it upsets the status quo and since we know Horus cant come back as his soul is shattered... status quo would be unbalanced.

His tactics worked whilst he was there and they worked for a while after he left.

10868993,0,t1_de11jqn,Essentially heres how it worksSpace Marines are implanted with artificial organs grown from gene seed one set of which is called the progenoid glands. The progenoid glands collect the genetic code of each of the marines specialist organs into these two glands one in the throat one in the chest. Upon death or possibly in older fluff after a period of maturation the progenoid glands are removed by an apothecary one a few years in and another later on. What this means is that you need one progenoid to grow the organs for a marine but each marine produces two given enough time and the correct facilities a chapter can sustain its own numbers without external assistance. The gene bank on Terra is used as a source of gene seed for founding new chapters whereupon a chunk of gene seed is grown inside vatgrown bodies across several generations til they end up with  samples. The gene bank is also a good way to check for gene seed purity to monitor chapters and to make sure they cant stockpile enough themselves to bulk their numbers out to legion level without anyone knowing.OK so why do traitor marines raid gene banks right? They raid them because their gene seed is frequently heavily mutated by warp contact or by being deficient in some way. Loyalist chapters occasionally have faulty gene seed that may stop specific organs working the Imperial Fists cant spit acid iirc may make them work differently the Black Dragons have a mutation of the organ that changes their bone composition they grow blades of bone or so on but only the traitor legions seem to have gene seed so corrupted from mutation that it is nonviable. ,40kLore,de1258d,8,t5_2zdqr
10872077,0,t1_de1cipc,There is one I dont remember what I know it wasnt a Games Workshop licensed thing. It was a crossover between something and Warhammer k. The story goes through a hell of a lot of trouble describing this strange foreign force and then it cuts to the soldier coming out of a forest. The soldiers las gun was broken he was the only one left. He was just standing there with his bayonet affixed at the end of his las gun.Its a single soldier versus the entire worlds army. A being I think their ruler teleports before him and lays down the riot act telling him that he doesnt have to throw his life away. Instead of responding and talking he just stands there staring up with his dark lenses. Eventually after too many questions he simply starts shaking his head. When the creature demands to know why he is doing it he takes off his mask and helmet revealing how he is a normal person with two blue eyes. He taps his forehead implying the creature to read his mind.The being quite literally starts crying realizing what the soldier has gone through. Without a word the soldier puts his helmet and mask back on. After that the battle starts.You know what the battle is? Its like The Death of Hollis Mason in the Watchmen movie. While to everyone else it is basically a group of thugs hitting a defenceless old man to that old man? Its reliving the glory days one more time going down in a blaze of glory. This army shot a few arrows at him letting it plink off his coat as he simply advanced towards them wielding his bayonet. He kept going and going until they shot him with energy beams and eventually through the burns and his pains he collapsed. They take off his mask and despite thoughts of pained and contortions he is smiling. A small smile. He whispers a thank you.He halfsings In life war. In death peace. In life shame. In death atonement. before drifting off into death.,40kLore,de1dlav,57,t5_2zdqr

It doesnt go well  daemons come out of the walls valiant heroes are sacrificed and those that make it are mentally scarred. On the flight back the commander of the mission opens the heavily sealed box warded with many open and die stickers to find...a black rock with some writing on it. Hes aghast and pissed off  his team was duped and instead of a weapon his soldiers died for a ruse. Hes called before Malcador  the one who authorized the mission  for his raging at the Imperium for tricking him and because he opened the box. Malcador lets him rage then explains the significance of the stone its impact on the world and the power the Enemy believes such artifacts of Order have on the world and why they seek to destroy that which makes humanity great before showing him a room full of such objects  including I believe the Mona Lisa and I believe the famous bust of Nefertiti. Its hinted that the commander then goes on to become one of the first Inquisitors. Also the Emperor has a room full of what he considers humanitys greatest achievements trophies of moments where the species went beyond itself do the impossible! see the invisible!. I think Corax is the one who sees this room and hes shocked at how this vault in one of the most secure locations of the Empire is filled with what seems to be mundane junk. There are things like the Apollo  plaque a Gutenberg bible and the first synthesis of the Navigator gene as well as pieces of some of the first computers but the place of pride is given to a broken piece of crude pottery. The Emperor explains that the shard marks humanity making something unique to the world  not just turning a rock into a sharp rock or a stick into a club but making something a tool that didnt exist in the world beforehand and that that spirit of invention imagination and daring was what he wanted to preserve. ,40kLore,de460hp,15,t5_2zdqr

And if its k lore then the single best place for lore are the Forge World Horus Heresy books not the Horus Heresy novels.  The novels are focused on individual characters and primarchs and dont even come close to capturing the tremendous amount of lore each legion has on their operations organizations and exploits.  If someones only reading the novels to get their understanding of a legion then Id say they are severely missing out.Because of that the least interesting legion for me are the Blood Angels but really only because they havent had a solid FW writeup yet.

11294790,0,t3_614tbs,Yes! Absolutely yes! And do you know why? Because they are cheeeeeaaaap as fuck and have a wealth of warfare to draw from.Any warband any chaos legion has spent  thousands of years surviving.replacing numbets is tough but they have perfected the Astartes Magyver act. They can throw together scraps of armor from any era and use rounds for any weapon they find. Incredibly useful in a huge theator of conflict.  Then add some demon magic and they can break even with smaller IOM Astartes attachmentents. But most of the time both sides Marinds spend a majority of their time mowing down inferior opponents. The Guard is why the imperium survives. They can v Chaos Marines and drown th in bodies. Chaos just cant get those numbers from cults and local uprisings. Sure the Imperium has shinier toys but their tech is in decay and they dont get extradimensional help on the reg. Bottom line is Chaos Marines in the field can go toe to toe while still being woefully unsupported logistically. Give them actual support like in a crusade and they can fuck shit up. They still have an ocean of Guardsmen they have to wade through just to touch another worthy opponent. The biggest advantage they have is leadership. Chaos Marines can regularly have Primarchs at their command not to mention the thousands of marines who have been fighring since the HH. A new recruit can expect training that while brutal will be some of the most battletested in the galaxy.

Prospective Astartes are children and theyd probably quickly adapt to their new situation if they are selected into the ranks of CSM who also arent the type to take rejection lightly. Also CSM dont have the elaborate support systems that a loyal chapter has. They have to beg borrow and steal to keep their forces in fighting shape. This includes using whatever geneseed you can get  you dont know when youll be getting more. Though I do see your point. Astartes really care about their honor  lineage. Some bands might not want to compromise themselves. Others might look down on a CSM with loyalist heritage I think Honsou wasnt well liked until he proved himself. But the traitor legions dont really exist anymore. Its all just groups with different ideologies  agendas even if they are both descendants of the same legion.

A story about a million worlds is about a  too many worlds. too many for me to care about not to mention far to many for even a great writer to string together and give identity to.Im still a stickler for simulation however. You can write a good story about specific characters and still maintain a believable galactic overhead.  Especially when you can fudge time with Warp Shenanigans. After all  of that story is going to be about a cast of characters. The galactic war is just the background. You might include a blurb at the start of a bookchapter about whats going on in the wider galaxy. But the book still focuses on a specific point with a narrow view.Imo upscale chapters. You will still have captains and sergeants and chapter masters to create great stories out of. It just fixes the absurd power balancing. Orcs? Numberless. Guardsmen? Numberless. Tyrannids Necrons Tau Eldar? No specific numbers Just descriptions. But space marines they have a number. A very specific insignificant number.

If you look at the horus Heresy series it is quite even.And besides writing from the Imperial and Chaos point of view I would say that only Eldar Dark Eldar would merit more extensive fiction.I would like to see more Dark Eldar books. The Malus Darkblade Dark Elf series in Warhammer Fantasy was freaking awesome so they should probably do something similar to that.ampnbspNevertheless you already have some great series focusing on the most interesting Chaos characters by one of the most talented authors in the BL roster Abaddon.Ive heard that the Ahriman trilogy is also quite great. You have the Night Lords trilogy and a bunch more coming.ampnbspDo you have more introductory books from an Imperial PoV? Sure. Eisenhorn Ravenor Gaunts Ghosts Ciaphas Cain...

11569703,0,t1_dg6mq25,You people misunderstand Lucius.He was never meant to be the best fighter. Hes a great fighter for sure but he enjoys a challenge. Hell go into fights he doesnt know if he can win because he wants to have a go and see how well he does. He doesnt fail he does exactly what he wants because he knows that even if he loses hell come back and the one who killed him will suffer.Hes sadistic in the extreme and just wants to have as much fun as possible killing what he can and trying to swing way above his own level for the hell of it. Thats why Slaanesh likes him. Slaanesh doesnt care who the best fighter is he likes Lucius because hes willing to go for what he wants regardless of how bizarre everyone around him thinks it is. He aims to get better and fight better things and nothing is going to make him reconsider.Lucius wins plenty of fights. He just also doesnt shy away from those he probably cant win. Other characters dont survive because theyre all better than Lucius they survive because they dont fight things without some way of beating them. For example if most characters saw someone or something coming at them who they knew was a better fighter or simply not within their capability to kill theyll try to have them gunned down or otherwise smashed instead of fighting them oneonone. Lucius has no such caution he just dives in with a grin and has a go.He has died so many times not because hes useless but because he knows he can.,40kLore,dg7fjjt,16,t5_2zdqr

11596373,0,t1_dgae1fw,Im a huge Mortarion fan but this is a very rosetinted perspective on his plight. I wont correct everything but there are some major points that need some changing. He had some good intentions but thats about it. His relationship with his first Death Guard and in many ways his Legion afterwards was unhealthy they viewed him as a preternatural neardivine saviour. This plays heavily into why they fall. And perhaps most importantly this guy is basically insane. He is seriously unhinged. Its not all his fault  he certainly had one of the worst upbringings of any Primarch if not the worst.Mortarion was not trying to create antitoxins for the people of Barbarus or even his Death Guard. He made suits that enabled them to withstand some level of the toxic mists that shrouded the mountains. It was the belief of Mortarion that this hardship made their people strong which he was obviously right about to some degree and its why he refuses to allow the people of Barbarus to be resettled or even for their world to be purified and made into something other than a toxic hellhole.Mortarion loses his shit because the Emperor turns up and steals his thunder. His position as the saviour and leader of Barbarus is suddenly in his eyes usurped after spending his entire life trying to bring down his fosterfather. He resolves to complete his task or die trying and he fails horrifically injuring himself mentally and physically in the process. It isnt because he wants to keep Barbarus free of the Imperium that he does this  hes more than happy to leave Barbarus as a toxic shithole and essentially turn it into a baby factory for his Legion. Then he intentionally makes his Death Guard into the baddest motherfuckers in the galaxy. He seeks out tyrants and xenos that oppress humanity and annihilates everything in his path. His Legion never stops to build or rebuild they just conquer and conquer and conquer using horrific chemical and bioweapons to a degree that their brother Legions begin to look uneasily at them which is a big part of why he falls in with Horus. But all the meanwhile Mortarion thirsted for glory. He hated his brothers for not having gone through what he went through and for not receiving what he perceived to be his fair share of the glory. This is constantly reiterated in both the novels and the original text  FW books where his disappointment in himself is overtly stated again and again. It isnt accolades he is after hes not a clone of Perturabo its his bitterness over his own set of circumstances. He always hated the Emperor it wasnt an epiphany that came to him after spending some time with Horus  like Angron he hated him from the moment he laid eyes on him. But did he change his ways rise above his upbringing in order to enlighten humanity offer Barbarus a future leave behind his necromantic childhood? No. During the Heresy he turns his back on the only part of his personality that was good his desire to save humanity he purges world after world of their human population. Any who resist he uses sorcery and the most unimaginably horrible weaponry to kill entire worlds believing killing a world cleanses the soul. Even in Promethean Sun preHeresy he uses bioweaponry to purge his sector of the planet leaving it uninhabitable for future generations. In another life perhaps he could have been a true saviour for humanity but he allows himself to be controlled by his upbringing. He intervenes in his Legions Apothecarion using necromantic knowledge... and helps develop weapons that are designed to kill and leave systems uninhabitable not to resettle worlds for humanity. gtRegardless it is the eldar we must concern ourselves with. Mortarions tone became dismissive. There are natives on the ice plains too but my attention is fixed elsewhere. Contempt for the weakness of the humans exuded from the Death Lords every pore.Just because people arent as tough as those of Barbarus hes prepared to just ignore their plight and biobomb their homeland. And this is before he turns bad.Mortarion is a sympathetic character to some degree. He loves and hates Barbarus just like he loves and hates himself. As a daemon remarks in Daemonology its astonishing he has any sanity left at all after his childhood on Barbarus. It was horrific and in a fashion similar to Angron he never had a chance to have an upbringing like Guilliman or Dorn which he resents. Nominally he fights for humanity to free all people from tyrants  at least at the beginning. He believed fervently that mankind should be free of oppression and terror and his creed was literally liberate humanity at any cost...by becoming the personification of terror and death and rendering entire star systems uninhabitable. And during the Heresy and some years before by killing entire sectors because they didnt align themselves with the Warmaster. He is not a good guy. He is arrogant disdainful paranoid to the degree where he cant take a compliment from any even Horus and when it comes to the Warp a delusional hypocrite by the early years of the Heresy. He is a mass murderer on a scale no other Primarch can match despite being the saving humanity guy. Your argument is certainly an interesting read I genuinely enjoyed it and I hope you dont take the wall of text as an insult but its more a case of his past explaining his actions rather than his past justifying them. Even his good side saving humanity father figure in his Legion really isnt very good at all. He deserves some sympathy and understanding but you can only give an insane massmurderer so much leeway. ,40kLore,dgagh4q,92,t5_2zdqr

11615280,0,t1_dgbf5ru,gtCompletely wrong. This is misunderstanding how markets and market shares work. That was not what I meant. Tabletop miniatures are a niche market due to the limited interest in them. This is the point  GW and other companies satisfy a very small market in comparison to the larger gamehobbyist market as there appears to be a perception that there is an untapped population itching to patronize GW if only they would just give in and let them. As illustrated by Asmodee whose product lines include household names like Star Wars there is not an excess of money in the tabletop gaming market let alone tabletop miniatures.gtIts not about not making the models I want its about ignoring markets letting your competition fill the market then trying to compete with that market only once you hit zero. Its dick.Well theyve never hit zero. It wasnt until  that GW was pushed from the top slot in highest selling tabletop games. Even now they sit at  according to IcV.gtYet strangely enough all of GWs biggest competitors in terms of sculpted plastic minatures have better representation of female characters and sell those models by the bucket load. Its fucking pissing away money because no we couldnt possibly have girls nobody wants that when they demonstrably fucking do. As evidenced in their own fucking market that theyre losing.Would giving more representation in miniatures solve all their problems? No. Are they missing ridiculous opportunities for money making because their market team is too far up their own way of doing things? Fuck yes.This is based on no evidence unfortunately.According to IcV and also the posted earnings from Asmodee and GW as of  the best selling tabletop miniatures game was Star Wars XWing which by virtue of being a game about starships has no female characters.  is Games Workshop which I dont need to speak of since thats the topic here.  is Star Wars Armada another spaceship game then  is Warmachine a predominantly mechbased game with few female options. Wrapping up the top  is Star Trek Attack Wing which is you guessed it spaceships.Now considering the revenue posting of Asmodee which at m euro is about triple the earnings of GW. However unlike GW which has two franchises and the hobbit thing but I have no idea on the stats of that line Asmodee covers a broad range of popular titles. Fantasy Flight is under their umbrella meaning that m number includes sales for both Star Wars XWing and Star Wars Armada. Asmodee also has Catan and the French rights to Pokemon. In short that m revenue in  does not simply reflect the direct competition to GWs market share but covers a broad range of product lines and genres from tabletop games to collectible card games.Basically the idea that GW is somehow missing out on insane amounts of money and patronage is nothing more than conjecture and personal opinion unsupported by anything. Id welcome data that would support that but I cant find anything that does.Dont get me wrong Im not against having female sculpts. Personally I care more about having female eldar sculpts because the IG is super boring to me and Id like to have a Kayleth mini because Dawn of War but my point here has never been for or against representation or female models but that the concept of it being detrimental to Games Workshop as a company is a rather weak argument in favor of it.,40kLore,dgclosm,1,t5_2zdqr

11624572,0,t1_dgdm94g,It was probably poor wording for me to say wouldnt be prepared to fight. You are correct that in FH the Word Bearers come down from their ships expecting a confrontation and they are ready to fire on the Ultramarines.I dont think theyd be ready for the Space Wolves trying to annihilate them though. If anything theyd expect AstartesonAstartes combat against a Legion that supposedly does wild charges without any thought to tactics.I dont think Russ will give them that. I outlined an attack from all sides and that would probably be illadvised but Russ could bring a Titan Legion with him or something. If he starts the fight as a headlong charge the Word Bearers will meet him the same thinking that its zealot rage vs berserk rage. If Russ pulls his forces back the WB follow thinking the SW are breaking only to run into a crossfire from  or  Warlord Titans and their auxiliary battlegroups.The Word Bearers certainly arent slouches and they have numbers on the Wolves but Russ has every strategic advantage in a situation like this and Prospero Burns shows both that hes cultivated an image among his brothers as not being shrewd or sophisticated and being willing to use that image to get the drop on his brothers.Its not so much a critique of the Word Bearers that they lose to the Wolves in this situation as it is recognition of Russs skill in his role as antiAstartes and his ability to take advantage of his brothers preconceptions and mental states. ,40kLore,dgdnnrg,1,t5_2zdqr

For example in the novel betrayer two legions face forces numbering  well trained troops with titan and ultramarine support for every traitor legionnaire they take the planet in a few weeks and it barely impacts the shadow crusade across ultramar.In every account in the  horus heresy series books the astartes are stated to be the most potent military force in the galaxy at the time despite there only being around  million.No book I have read I have read every one in the heresy series has suggested that the astartes legions were ever supplanted as the primary force of the great crusade nor were they a secondary force to the imperial army rather that they predominated both in authority and firepower and burned worlds of billions in massive extermination campaigns on the ground.How else would the traitor legions possibly be a threat if astartes were not capable of such feats the threat would primarily be from daemons and cultists not the marines who number only a million if even that.I suggest you look at the numbers the fluff and put two and two together.,40kLore,dge13pt,4,t5_2zdqr

Suddenly the population of the planet fights the Korps turning the numbers advantage against them. Tau are also shit in close combat so the Korps charges actually work and they have to use some brutal tactics to get into range to do so. For example using tau and local populace as human shields take a route via a promethium pipeline they have gas masks should last long enough!. Since the Tau dont make static lines the Death Riders could even save the day vs Suits and some suicide tactics vs Stealth suits would also be very fitting remember every Kriegsman comes outfitted with a Krak grenade!And hey a chance to outGreater Good the Tau is always worthwhile to see.

The majority of their logistics came through horsesThe idea that Sherman Tanks were killed like nothing is a complete mythAs for the MG it was a good weapon but only a fool would call it the best. It had a very specific purpose area denial. It was good at providing suppressing fire over a wide area but it was not good at accurately aimed fire nor punching through light armor limiting its use in an antiaircraft role. A great weapon at its role but very limited beyond it. The M Browning was by far the most versatile machine gun of WWII and its no surprise that its still the most widely used machine gun today. Also. Here are some warwinning technologies that the Germans were behind in compromised in or completely lacked.  Pressurized Aircraft Cabins Radar EncryptionDecryption Electronic Warfare Amphibious Landing Vehicles Long Range Bombers Efficient Aircraft Fuel Aircraft Carriers Norden Bomb Sight HEAT and HESH antiarmor warheads Radar Homing Projectiles The Atomic Bomb for fucks sakeTo sum things up your Technological Advanced Wehrmacht was mostly using outdated equipment from the s s and even the first world war while having their supplies pulled on horse drawn wagons. Developments like the STG and the MG were the exception not the norm. gt There is a Reason the Third Reich hold their Line so long against so many Combined Forces.Hold the line? First off youre making it sound like the Nazis were on the defensive the entire time which is false no matter how you spin it. Secondly they did not hold out very long at all.

11666754,0,t1_dgifj70,Probably. But the Custodes dont mess around when it comes to guarding the Emperor. Even the slightest chance regardless of how utterly minisicule it is isnt worth taking because without the Emperor the Custodes cease to have purpose. Their entire being is dedicated to protecting and serving him personally. In addition the Imperium collapses with the death of the Emperor. To add even the tiniest additional risk seems unwise. I imagine the very fact that the Grey Knights are all Psykers despite the fact theyve never fallen to Chaos makes Custodes wary in addition to the usual contempt they hold for Astartes in general.Plus the Grey Knights have a whole galaxy of daemonicheretical threats they have to constantly be on the lookout for and combat against. And since the Imperial Palace is extremely unlikely to have even the smallest hint of Chaos to deal with theyre largely wasted in acting as his bodyguard. ,40kLore,dgifwzx,15,t5_2zdqr

The Death Guard were good workhorses with or without corruption. But I would have preferred them uncorrupted as they had a little more zeal beforehand.  ,40kLore,dgm4i7f,1,t5_2zdqr

Something that unless were actually not reading at all HH novels shouldnt surprise us.The whole series is a giant dont take K propaganda at face value.  People wanted to read about the Emperor as is remembered . years after his sacrifice they instead found a very different and more realistic version of the Emperor not the caring father the almighty God the benevolent ruler. They found a thing that is not human and never was. An immortal being that wants the best for the human species not for the single individual humans that compose it. A being that at that point in history is more than . years old and does not have a human psychology. Something that does not have emotions goals and ethics that are understandable by humans. Something as detached from mankind as astartes are to normal imperial soldiers.They wanted the Ecclesiarchy version of the Emperor that is a carefully constructed lie created to perpetuate its cult.
