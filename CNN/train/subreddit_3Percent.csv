9790284,0,t1_dajui0o,With Aline I just considered that a power grab in light of her situation. She had enough evidence to get rid of him she was just doing her job but she also wanted to take his job. The other option was to turn him in and get nothing so I didnt really see that as being ruthless. Ezequiel is another creature altogether so him yes definitely lacking morals. The council leader was pretty disgusted with herself for what she did and in fact ended their friendship over it. I think she was just protecting herself in that Ezequiel was probably her choice to replace Mattheus. I dont really see that as ruthless.His assistant I assume would also be the woman I referred to as his righthand woman so we are in agreement there again. She was probably recruited the same way he tried to recruit Joana. In contrast to the other Aline and the councilwoman who changed the file Ezequiel and probably this woman did something unnecessary and immoral just to exercise their power or because of some other inner shortcoming. To me that is on a whole other level compared to the other people. Coucilman Matteus was trying to get back his old job and he actually thought Ezequiel was doing a bad job. So again I dont really see that on the same level as murdering someone or being okay with loose morality. ,3Percent,dajv60b,5,t5_39fyl

You are right though we do not know what challenges there existed  years ago but the family trying to convince the contestant to stop is a great addition and in someways is the best time to leave the Process.,3Percent,dazcxun,1,t5_39fyl
10066931,0,t3_5gjc5w,Actually what bothered me about this one is that they said that the decision had to be unanimous or they would all be eliminated and the last one who was eliminated obviously didnt agree. I thought the tricky part of this test was going to be convincing the one that everyone else voted for to go along with it because shes out either way and has no real incentive not to bring everyone else down with them. In fact I expected that to be used as a strategy to avoid elimination Dont pick me Ill take you all down with me!,3Percent,dbjqsu3,6,t5_39fyl
