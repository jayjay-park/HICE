The thing I enjoy the most about this passage is your asides the little moments where the snide remarks come through example He let Jerome have his moment. Those quippy comments are what bring me back for more. Good start!,250words,cq4yvv6,3,t5_37qfo

3640458,0,t3_31xwg9,This is really good. Your imagery is evocative the flow is smooth and the pace is steady. I like that the sense of loss and longing builds gradually. I also like that you dont show us too much too fast which is a common issue Im seeing in other pieces this short that try to cram too many ideas into  words.I think the last three sentences are out of place though. It felt like they belong in the next  words.Thank you for sharing ,250words,cq78myn,2,t5_37qfo
