3192395,0,t3_2wpbyo,Part OneampnbspArthur sat at his small cubicle desk in the corner office suite on the seventh story of the inconspicuous building on fifteenth street. He sat not thinking of anything in particular. Mostly he was just staring at a tiny group of pixels that werent working on his computer monitor. There were probably seven or eight in an uneven little patch. In the corner of his mind Arthur was vaguely aware that the customer on the phone had just asked a question.Oh um yes Ms. Pacheco I understand how difficult this is for you.Ms. Pacheco then said something sad and tearfilled before breaking down in a full sobbing fit. Arthur was familiar with this approach. A lot of people tried it on him when he said the word foreclosure over the phone. He just pressed the mute button and looked for something else to stare at absently.It wasnt that Arthur didnt care that these people were losing their homes. He found it very sad. But he had worked in the foreclosures department for three years and the reactions were always predictable. Ms. Pacheco was no doubt a wonderful lady who didnt deserve to lose her house but she had missed too many payments. Such was the world Arthur lived in. He often felt it to be unforgiving and spent most of his time at work wishing he were elsewhere.In the midst of Ms. Pacheco saying something about her catsin between sobs of courseArthur spotted something that troubled him far more than it probably should have. It had been hanging around the office all day just out of reach. Now it had settled neatly on top of the computer monitor. Checking that the phone was muted he whispered to his nemesis Ive got you now. You thought you could escape me. Ive been tracking you all day and youve finally landed right where I want you. Well prepare to die pest!With that he swatted wildly at the monitor with a rolledup memo knocking over an odd looking paperweight and flinging his headset off his head. After several intense seconds of conflict the house fly flew away perfectly unharmed....and Ive just beenhaving so much trouble latelyfinding workand theres got tobe something you can do! Ms. Pacheco sobbed at last Sirare you there?Arthur quickly composed himself Yes Ms. Pacheco I realizing he still had the phone muted he pressed the button and began again Ahem um yes Yes Ms. Pacheco. Im sorry but this is a notification of foreclosure. My records show you had um many chances to discuss your options. Contact was made seven times regarding this matter. At this time you are required by law toOn and on the usual speech went. Arthur had several variations of the suggested notification and all of them were boring and depressing. He didnt enjoy his job. It paid well had terrific benefits and even gave him three weeks paid vacation. All in all he should be quite happy with his career but he just wasnt. All his life he had dreamed of doing so much more. Surely he had always thought there was more to life than sitting in an office telling people they must move out of their homes.At last Ms. Pacheco hung up the phone. Arthur sighed in relief as he saw it was time for his break. He clocked out from his computer and put his head down on his desk with a thud. A quick nap might improve his outlook on life.,1_stormageddon_1,cosw3x5,1,t5_370pw
