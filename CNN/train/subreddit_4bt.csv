1446283,0,t1_cixdnwf,Not sure what the difference is however they ARE different. see part supersessions  for both numbers notice how they dont coincide Edit It seems the only difference is that the first crank is certified by the marine society and its only required when the engine needs to be approved by the marine agency. I have attached the descriptions on quickserve that have some information that seems kind of cryptic to me right now Im sure one of my work buddys would know about this but we are closed for vacation at the moment. Note If you give me an ESN I might be able to find something else for you. Hope I was of help. ,4bt,cixkg85,2,t5_2z732
