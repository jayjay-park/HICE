The gap it created between players with it and players without it was too large especially considering just how hard it was to get. It just would need to be made more accessible to the less wealthy maybe a new minigame reward? Soul Split could be rewarded by a minigame and also require  prayer.

At the same time I hope you dont hold this too much against Mod Mat since hes completely right when he says that the DDOS has nothing to do with Jagex or Runescape and your ISP is the only company that can assist you with this.  You seem to understand the technical aspects of the DDOS so Im guessing you understand what heI are saying.    At the same time its strange that Jagex wont show you the evidence for your mute.  I honestly havent played Runescape in months but Ive played onoff for  years and dont remember them refusing to show the chatlogs even a single time.  I would be interested to hear about any updates on that front.    Really though man your primary issue seems to lie with this group of playersDDOSers not the mute itself.  Besides doxxing them yourself Im not really sure what advice to offer you.  You already put their names out in public in this post so that is helpful to other players at least.    I guess all I can really give for advice is to try to not let it get you down.  I know thats easier said than done but you presumably play Runescape for fun not to get stressed out.    Anyway best of luck and if your mute wasnt deserved I hope it gets reversed ASAP.  ,2007scape,ceyxt9y,1,t5_2wbww

Its worth looking for a solution that would help with the main problem but not have all the baggage that makes those people dislike the GE. Whatever we come up with it may be ages before we get the game engine features to implement so theres ample time for discussion.Were planning a sort of survey to try and work out what sort of trading system people would most appreciate. Maybe itll confirm that a GE copy will do fine or maybe therell be more support for playertoplayer meetups.,2007scape,cf8h2kn,2,t5_2wbww

396424,0,t3_1ymmpl,Ive always enjoyed Runescape the way it was. Ofcourse I was pissed about free trade going away ofcourse I was looking foward to a new skill or bossmonster. But you could adapt to every update imo the good ones the bad ones and the terrible ones Runescape was still Runescape. Until EoC came.EoC modernised the combat system therefore changed the aspect I loved the most completely. I was playing the game  years at that point. And I was too far into it to get used to a system I didnt even want in the game. Long story short I quit from one day to the other and abandoned close to max account. And it was nearly heartbreaking since I still loved that game.Until OSRS came out I was always thinking about playing again but Runescape was just an accelerated mainstream game. I loved the effciencytrend not wasting xp but I disliked the extremely high Xprates in all skills. For example Runespan devalued RC  completely.All in all when I heard about OSRS I doubted the fact that I could start all over again. Now Im sitting at a comfortable basis of skills and bank ready to make my way up. Theres so much to do I dont even know where to start sometimes. To conclude for me this isnt just a very good game. It feels like living your life again whilst avoiding all the mistakes you made. It is not only nostalgia since I never wanted to quit the old RS I just went back to the game I know. And I wouldnt care which year we started from. Personally I would have probably enjoyed the time Nex came out. But thats a different story. It is good the way it is. ,2007scape,cflusyr,17,t5_2wbww

A dragon square shield is clearly not the best item but it serves a purpose of adequacy for stats correlating with the affordable price.

I think that would really have to come down to the community.You could go both ways with the javelins upgrading them would be easier on the team but Id like to see an actual item exist. If they did take the item path you could spend tickets to recharge it in  javelins thrown per X tickets. If this actually did go through I would see them just using the upgrade over an item just for the sake of less work.Allowing rangers to wear capes with bonuses other than a minor range boost while still grabbing their fired ammo would be too good in my opinion. Id still really get behind it for a castle wars only change.I wouldnt mind a simple potion at that cost I was just tossing out some ideas.Your dragon armor idea Im alright on but it would be up the community in the end anyway.What I really meant the purpose of the bracelet to be is an item for activities that dont really involve combat or the need for a glove slot keeps it balanced with herb.Thats why it needs to be looked at. I like it myself except the defender role. Fuck being defender.Someone with an MSB that dies would have to drop less than or equal to k as a result.

As far as player interaction goes i think its the most over rated thing in the game when it comes to trading. its either getting raped by prices in a bank by merchers or having an obnoxious time trying to buy a bunch of items off zybez which takes forever and  of the time doesnt even work because of incompetence. i will gladly give up that  of player interaction that is trading and save my time ,2007scape,cgbtin5,1,t5_2wbww

720668,0,t3_22eycw,I check the Runescape subs occasionally just to see how things are developing in game.  I sometimes read RS fansites to see how people are reacting to the major changes Jagex are implementing.I dont play at all but the game holds a lot of fond memories.  Ive played since  so Ive seen a lot of change in Runescape.  Runescape is also interesting as its a game that was once wildly popular but is now attempting to redefine itself so it makes for an interesting game to occasionally observe from an old players perspective.  Personally although I dont play I think Jagex are doing some really cool things with scape and RS.  You can clearly tell from their YouTube videos and active JMod presence outside the RSOF that they care far more about their community and have a lot of involvement with their players than they once did.  I think they realised that they couldnt remain isolated from their community forever particularly after player numbers gradually dropped after the whole  free trade fiasco.  Up until that point most of Runescape was entirely player run.  In particular the entire Clan world was run by Zybez and other fansites with no Jagex involvement.  Its nice to see Jagex constantly running events for their players now which was unheard of not too long ago.,2007scape,cgm6yrp,3,t5_2wbww

Once you  have the right size color and font hide this layer. Then simply cover up your current level the nd number with your little masking design make sure not to cover the line or any text. Simply copy  paste that skill number you made to all the skills. Centeradjust if necessary and then fill in the number.

798395,0,t1_cgv0sli,Thats an interesting concept. The main reason why I wrote this up is because of the specific range cape function in an attempt not to compare it to other setups. Melee requires no consumables other than foodpots Magic requires consumables but you dont have to actually retrieve your runes. I dont know how balanced it would be to add a function to all capes and maybe that is the better path for this if it was to work but In my mind right now I see that if the function was added only to range capes it wouldnt be as game changing as it could be to change other capes as well.

It would have been worrying if there wasnt one. gtTo sum up what do you think we should do next to ensure the quality and implementation of updates are in line with your expectations and how we can avoid situations like this in future?Very simple the streamer favoritism must stop. Youre favoring streamers who do what they do for money over other groups who are more knowledgeable and experienced who do not do what they do for money but for a love of the game. This is incredibly unfair. I dont think anything more be said than that  stop showing favoritism to the streamers. People are clearly against it and if its we the players who make oldschool what it is I think you should listen to us. ,2007scape,chcpjag,9,t5_2wbww

988076,0,t1_chgldbc,I get that most skills are similar to one another. Crafting smithing. Mining woodcutting. So have this as an  off shoot of construction this is much more than just building houses isnt bad. An RTS aspect should be welcomed is original and I think fun and intuitive .  I guess you could view it as a mini game or distraction like managing a Kingdom but this brings in new rewards that I should of added to the body of my presentation. Getting rare materials for each skill brings some new blood to the game. New crafting recipes smithing recipes new fish new bosses with the underground caverns. Theres a lot of potential to do this to enhance the game. Also when you are a king you do gain experience going through the trials and stipulations. You learn what you can and cant do with your citizens and how to raise an effective army. It is a skill one that not many throughout our own history mastered. Also a big thing I like to point out you dont have to touch this skill and you wont be effected much. Its not overbearing and needed to progress like like summoningbreeding hybrids. It takes nothing away from the old school vibe and makes good use of older content. ,2007scape,chglo8r,1,t5_2wbww

If the account had low to medium stats when the person bought it and jagex suspected OP of having sold it or given it away than it should be banned whereas if the account was high leveled and jagex has no reason to believe it was soldgiven away it should go back to OP.  Because the way that the person acquired the account was against the rules he should not be able to keep it no matter what.  Even if he purchased it with all level s he still shouldnt keep it but in such a case OP would not have put in the work to really show that the account is his so a permanent ban would likely be the best option. ,2007scape,chmqmvt,1,t5_2wbww

1203450,0,t1_ci4zy33,Honestly because theres no point for the ring of aggression. Its very rare to use more than one style at a time crushstab for example and in the rare instances you do I believe you should be able to switch between rings in order to add a bit of difficulty into it assuming youre switching spec  main weapon.I do agree we need  bonuses or theyll just be dead content. Like I said above it really should have been two different questions. Many people are against this imbue being granted via Nightmare Zone along with all the other imbues because its forcing people to do NMZ. I dont think  is actually against these rings being increased by  more bonus because otherwise theyre useless. I also believe the prayer ring should be polled seperately because maybe there is a reason to not want a  prayer bonus ring even though Im currently not aware of what it is.,2007scape,ci508k8,2,t5_2wbww

As for him and the community not getting along perhaps the community should stop trying to start shit with the people that are our link to Jagex? That entire thread about SilentCre leaving Jagex was a big fuckfest about how bad of a jmod he was and how much of a shitty video maker he was.Jagex thinks long and hard about who they add to their team but the community takes  seconds to decide Hey lets go fuck with that guy BECAUSE WE CAN.

The higher your attack accuracy the more accurate your cannon hits. For example warrior ring is better with smoke devils than berserker ring when cannoning. So every monster weak to stab that can be cannoned is ideal to have a stab ring.

Ask us if we have any interest in an update work on it for as long as needed to make it a good fit in the game and then poll it. This way we avoid wasting the devs time only to have these updates never end up in the game at all.Also I really dont believe we need a new poll every week and Im pretty sure most people would understand taking a little longer to develop updates considering the size of the dev team.,2007scape,cj012x4,30,t5_2wbww

1474244,0,t1_cj11c3j,That is one bold ass opinion I must say. I politely disagree with you I think both games have their ups and downs towards combat system but just because you dont approve EOC doesnt mean RS as a whole is garbage. Both combat systems are good in their own way. Osrs has simplified version while still making it work and RS has complex system trying to offer a bigger challenge for their players. Now with the legacy update you can even use the same combat system in both games.I also strongly disagree with you thinking that osrs will come bigger than RS. RS has k players every evening reaching k on weekends while OSRS has approximately kk players. In order for OSRS  to have bigger playerbase you need atleast k more players to join every night. When fp trial was released we gained about k more players. I doubt when its fully realised we will get k more players every evening.I think your point is invalid and next time you should read through your post before you post it because at the moment you just made yourself look like a  year old spoiled brat who starts crying if he doesnt get what he wants.,2007scape,cj12krb,16,t5_2wbww

1560643,0,t1_cjbw7jb,Well remember the k would not be a one time fee. Every time they die they need to pay up k. When all of your skills are below level  making more than khr is tough. For instance dying  times would be k. Sure they could offset the cost by killing others. However for those learning to PK this is still going to suffer them a loss especially when they need to find food and maybe potions and rarely ever get an actual k kill from loot alone.Shutting out low levels to Regular Worlds isnt very attractive and essentially level locks PvP content if these BH Worlds became very popular.,2007scape,cjbwe6z,1,t5_2wbww
1560687,0,t1_cjbwe6z,I agree with you but I also know that anything under k would not likely be a big enough deterrent to stop people from ragging. Even at k I doubt it will stop over  of them. k per kill is quite a lot and it would make the bounty zone somewhat of a higher riskloot area by design. I dont see this as a problem in of itself.

Theres been ridiculous amount of people telling Jagex to remake the Dragon Spears special attack since its useless until people realized you can actually stunlock people with it or shove people from singlezone to multizoneIn the clip theres like  people killing one person. Fucking  versus one. The results shouldnt surprise anyone. I would understand the problem if one person could spec like  times in a row but a person can only spec four  times which is around  seconds worth of stun with the price of a full special bar.

1583266,0,t3_2cepi5,Until a J Mod gives a detailed explanation well never know for sure. Mod Reach has said that the only thing you need to do to get a specific Barrows item is to kill the corresponding brother so Im assuming if you only care about the Barrows items all you need to do is kill the  brothers and loot the chest. I stopped getting extra KC on crypt monsters recently and noticed that I didnt get blood runes bolt racks and RDT items. So if you want to get those I would kill  extra crypt monsters and get  KC because apparently thats the optimal KC even though it was never explained why. And Id like to add that not even Reach himself can seem to agree on a number because Ive heard him throw around other numbers on stream. Just because Mat K used  on stream doesnt mean its correct.,2007scape,cjeqrya,1,t5_2wbww

1607946,0,t1_cjhrrk4,I have a crappy desktop from  that hasnt been able to comfortably play RS since probably around . Which was fine uni was taking up a lot of my time too. So I just didnt play. Oldschool comes out and I am ecstatic  its  what I do in my free time now. Oldschool is a game from . It was not even top notch back then they had to make sure that people with existing hardware could play so that puts machines back to  or even earlier that were meant to play this game.I can sympathise with your financial situation. I am a student. I take massive amounts of sweetener packets for my coffee and massive amounts of plasticware from dining halls just to pinch those few more pennies.I cant tell you that youre wrong about thinking the firecape goes against the spirit of RS but I think that you are. That makes no sense.This game is huge. There are things for everyone to do. Whether that be merchanting bankstanding skilling PvM or PvP. Take your pick.Im sorry your hardware doesnt allow you to have optimal playing conditions in a very specific situation of the game where  frames lost could be your death. But you could very well easily die there too even without any frame loss. The point of the Jad is that its frigging hard. That is not against the spirit of RS. The spirit of RS is not  laid back no matter what you think. There have been difficult bosses to battle and ridiculous quests to complete ever since RSC. Jad is  perfectly within the spirit of RS.I say this while sympathising with your situation. Find a public library or uni or something with decently new PCs. Check their hours and policies. If you can spend an hour on a PC at once grab a frigging red bull and make a date of it. Your situation is not optimal you already know that but its also not impossible.,2007scape,cjhukwj,1,t5_2wbww

You dont have to be in the square next to something to attack it. And mage has a crap ton of utility that comes with it. Teleports alching freezing binding teleblocking veng the list goes on. Imagine if melee was ranged or had the utility that magic does. The game wouldnt be any fun. The main way to do damage in this game is melee and always was melee. You just have to accept that. Ranged and Magic have their own benefits that make them worth training they dont need to be buffed to be on par with melee. Theyre in separate categories altogether.,2007scape,ckaefqu,5,t5_2wbww

If jagex doesnt quicly kfix this i can easily see  inflation by next friday minimum. This is pumping so much raw GP in to the game its unbelieveable i have clanmates who have already made m stacks on level  accs boosting each other and alching rewards on mains.The thing is this is not circulating GP like RC fishing or bossing. The GP doesnt simply move from one player to another never affecting the total pool of GP in the game. The money that comes from BH is raw new GP in to the game in simple terms when you sell k worth of lobsters the other player loses k gp. With BH you just gain k GP.Its already showing up in highvalue items that people who have abused this are investing in as they know the prices will skyrocket expect AGS to pop up by at least m before sunday if jagex doesnt fix this. Shortly after everything else will follow and soon we are going to be in hyperinflation BH will set a baseline of m gphr with  requirments.

They decide what should and shouldnt be polled so when they do poll something they will feel that adding such content would send the game in a good direction. They will NOT poll anything they think would be harmful to the game. It partially makes up for the fact that  is needed to pass. If they dont show confidence in their updates nothing will ever pass ever.gtStreamers have the right to say what they want to their followers within the boundaries of Twitchs rules of course assuming theyre using Twitch. Their followers have the right to not tune into their streams should the streamer be doing something they dont want and even then they have the right to vote as they choose.gtThey arent being manipulated theres been TONS of votes ever since Sparcs stream not all of them are prosigils.,2007scape,ckps7fg,1,t5_2wbww

2015701,0,t1_ckw0jix,Are you serious? Godswords add ons to whipss spirit shields etc. You can drink potions that cost k each to never worry about d bolt specs again. Dark bow is insanely inaccurate. The odds of the doomsday spec everyone complains about are over . Arma c bow spec sucks. Msb double spec is kind of cool but its lost on death. None of these come close to the power of something like an ags. TWO specials to potentially hit upwards of a  in PvP? How was that ever justified? Theoretically youd hit your ags max almost  times before something like a  dark bow spec. And on top of that range doesnt even have an equal prayer to melee. Im sorry but youre talking about power creep in the wrong combat category. As a maxed tank at  combat I get specced out way too much by people with  attack. The RNG is quite rewarding for the spec weapons melee has to offer. Everyone has this massive fear of range that limits major updates from ever making it into the game. Its part of the issue with a game determined by majority votes when the majority of PvP accounts are melee based.  While OPs idea may not fit range  needs a big update.,2007scape,ckw37du,4,t5_2wbww

From there you will only have to train a few attack and defense levels to max them out.  Definitely do the quest for Piety even if you dont plan on getting  prayer just yet.  If they introduce Augury and Rigour the miniquest to unlock the prayers gives like k atk exp so you will ruin your account getting them should you make that decision.

Runescape knows this they refuse to ban him because he maintains k viewers on twitch for there advertisement. Instead of being fair this seems like Marks managing techniques. Rather than fairness to all lets get as much money as we can and hopefully the company stays afloat. I hope you realize a huge percentage of your OSRS players are older. We arent dumb youre picking favorites and giving them better customer service along with letting them break rules. Any time a streamers tweets a Mod with an issue it gets addressed instantly. My appeal has been pending going on  months along with multiple attempts through social media and their website I get nothing but a bullshit copied and pasted message about keeping my account secure. I run  digit stocks on a daily basis on my computerlaptop. Pretty sure if I was compromised theyd attack that rather than a runescape account. Lets be logical here.,2007scape,clhr6ob,12,t5_2wbww

2242533,0,t1_clohqrl,Botting Doing it on a signle account isnt going to mug me off worse than a whole goldfarm op but its still not good.Itemscamming I hate it worse when it happens to me of course but its a pretty scummy practice. I mean there are lures and scams that are just dreadfully obvious but in some cases you just cant expect everyone to know that the rogues den is a dangerous bank or that you cant get your items back from a certain place inside of a quest area which is where you stood when you died. Real world trading This is a pretty bad one self explanatory too.Anything thats just scumbaggy i.e. attacking someone just to waste their food and supplies in the wilderness opening and closing doors to annoy others and following players around the game to crash their once empty worlds for bossing and other PVM activities. I suppose you might also count stuff like killing someone in the wilderness from whom you have nothing to gain but when they have much to lose like an ironman killing another ironman for no good reason beyond youre in the wilderness.Account hijacking So long as your passwords are all fine and dandy you havent got anything to worry about and dont visit fishy sites. Most of the time it seems when someones account is hacked theyve recently gotten a virus of some sort from some website or they logged in the runescap.ecom forums with their details.

Scan your pc with something like malwarebytes then change the password to your email. After youve done those steps if you can log into the account on the runescape homepage you should change the password. If thats however the case that you cant.Try and tweet jagexsupport to see if they can provide assistance. Follow their instructions if theyve got any.If all else fails and you cant recover your account from the hacker you should go and lie down in a corner cry for  minutes then pick yourself up and create an account even better and learn from your mistakes.

Not diehard.mm enjoy the game but probably treat other things more importantly. Likes to primarily play Runescape when not busy. Understand the game and their views on it very well.m diehard runescape players. Probably their biggest passion currently.

A lot more effort than just doubleclicking on a list to the side while being in the game. Not to mention countering a thirdparty software argument with another thirdparty software doesnt really make sense.Honestly this is what ruins shops and spawns good luck getting steel platebodies as a new player if you dont have a thirdparty software to use.

2417804,0,t1_cmagutk,Honestly the issue at hand is not that you can AFK a skill its that you can AFK it completely for  hours straight without having to worry about anything or check on your screen. The idea behind the  hour AFK at Guthans is comparable to actual botting whats the difference between setting up the bot and AFKing for  hours compared to setting up an NMZ dream and AFKing for  hours? Ones allowed on RS and the other one isnt. Then lets ask ourselves why is botting not allowed and why do we ban those that bot? Because they have an unfair advantage by still being able to play the game without actually being there. The concept of the  hour AFK at NMZ is exactly the same. I have no problem with normal NMZ the prayer pot method or dharoks method since they require you to still monitor the screen every now and then just like other AFK skills such as Fishing or Woodcutting. ,2007scape,cmajs1e,1,t5_2wbww

2470175,0,t1_cmgc0ua,My solution for this although Id assume would be incredibly unpopular would be to increase the range and Mage too while were at it level cap to . Using the current combat calculating system a player with  strength and Attack could have  Mage and range. Level  is exactly double the amount of XP required for  anything so that could be a logical level considering  Attack and defense added together would have that much XP. Perhaps this wouldnt effect PvP or something like your levels would effectively be capped at like  or something of the sort. We dont need Void Dbow rushers with the ability to OHKO any player even if brewed above  Hp. Definitely needs some polishing and INB EoC and perhaps youre right but ideas are ideas.Also magic damage should increase as levels go up. Theres very little situations outside of bursting or maybe Barrows or splashing which I wouldnt really consider training where PvM is a useful way of training. I should be able to train using Fire Strike without breaking the bank and without having my max hit capped at  if Im at  magic.Feedback anybody?,2007scape,cmh0gpk,1,t5_2wbww

2527065,0,t3_2olx9s,While I am also a fan of Conquest its my favorite minigame I doubt well see it anytime soon. Despite what you may think developing it would be quite the task and I dont believe it would be as easy as copypasting the code from RS. As for your matchmaking if youll recall there were two rooms one to challenge others and one for matchmaking and everybody used the former. In regards to void Ill admit that if conquest was never a thing I would never had ever gotten all the void gear. Personally I dont enjoy Pest Control because its so repetitive and in a game all about grinding thats saying something. Even if it was to be developed and put in I feel that there are far too few people interested in playing it for it to be worthwhile unfortunately. ,2007scape,cmof9zu,2,t5_2wbww

Some skills like herblore do have high level items but in OSRS you can just buy those items anyway so getting the skill yourself isnt all that useful. Agility on the other hand lets you run more which is beneficial for everything. High agility is almost necessary for those newish wilderness bosses if only because you can run away from pkers. If Im paying attention youll never kill me because you wont catch me.This is coming from a PvMer so Im pretty damn biased.

Demand goes up for the supplies for a time while that end product crafting method is profitable but after a time the end product is flooding the market  people pile it all in the GE.

As a kid my parents were extremely agaisnt the idea of spending money on video games so I spent most of my time killing hill giants cutting yews and fishing in Karamja. It was not until highschool that a friend of mine told me to buy membership with prepaid credit cards so that my parents wouldnt know about it. Eventually my membership ran out and I had no money left to to buy more and I eventually told myself that Ill stick to FP until I can afford membership again. But I got so bored of it that I took more than a  day break from which the first thing that I did when I came back was to get membership so that I can enjoy the game once more. That said you cant come back to FP once you go PP FP was the reason why Ive stuck with this game for so long and the reason I even gave OSRS a try back in October  when there was a FP weekend.,2007scape,cnw49l9,7,t5_2wbww

2927595,0,t1_co0utlx,That is the one downside to bonds. However as you might have realized I and many others believe the pros outweigh the cons. I mean if you think about it buying bonds and selling them for money is hardly a problem. It doesnt affect you if somebody buys a bond and sells it for gp no gold is put into the game no resources are being farmed etc. It literally doesnt affect anybody if somebody is buying bonds and selling for RSGP.However third party RWT is different because supplies are farmed and that hurts the economy.I just dont understand why everybody cares so much if people want to spend  on bonds and sell them for in game money. I understand making a fuss out of someone spending  on money that they buy from a third party RWT company that makes the money through gold farming but Ill never understand why someone buying bonds matters.If anything this will only harm third party RWTers and help improve the economy. Bonds are not going to harm it in any way whatsoever so why do people care if somebody got their AGS through buying and selling bonds? Just my opinion on it but I and some others literally do not care because it doesnt affect me you or anybody else AT ALL,2007scape,co0vm4y,1,t5_2wbww

2950780,0,t3_2tyllk,. It doesnt. There will be more bots than ever with FP. Simply put by introducing FP and bonds at the same time they are masking their loss of profit that will ensue from canceled botgold farmer membership. They dont profit from FP because the gold farming bots now have no incentive to buy membership. They lose money because of that. . It does decrease the amount of money yes. I believe theres a  cost to make a bond tradable of course this is only after it has moved ownership twice. That will remove some money from the economy no doubt but I dont think it would be that significant . It does not reduce RWT. Buying bonds is legal RWT I believe it will actually encourage RWT even more. It is still and always will be cheaper to buy GP from a third party. ,2007scape,co3in1c,0,t5_2wbww

Introduction of ways to pay for gains means that scamers have less insensitive to scam you account to get your items because they then have to compete on value to the game maker who will always win.A introduction of bonds should see the start of the death of gold selling websites.It should hopefully mean less scamming via fake websites etc to acquire passwords to steal your gold to sell. Of course these will still take place but it will be harder so either the scamers have to scam a lot more then before or they are taking your details just for personal gains.,2007scape,co4pdnb,1,t5_2wbww

RS  the live version other version of RS in many peoples eyes messed up with the removal of Free Trade and Wilderness but got even worse with the gradual introduction of MTX Microtransactions. There seems to be on average k active players at any time online most huddled into Varrock or popular minigames. th February FP will be released. It will have the full FP area up to Taverly etc. You will have to start a new account unfortunately OSBuddy was made by a now Jagex Mod who has a shady past with Botting clients. However the client is safe to use and is the most used client for OSRS. There are mixed reports on it because it allows some strong features that Jagex have let through e.g. Farming patches notifications Used to be able to see herb drops.,2007scape,co8mtka,0,t5_2wbww

Now I cannot spend that much time online and Id rather have a maxed account which I can PK on rather than spending all my time training to max.

You guys always let gold farmers and bots ruin this game by creating content around them.You cannot tell me that any new player will come see they cant actually make money for the first  hours that theyre in game and end up just staying. Trade restrictions would work for FP if we had a GE price guide. Id be all for that. Then new players could sell their goods and buy other goods while bots would have to give an even exchange essentially not really doing anything because Object A and B are the same price and are just switching accounts.Edit Still a shitty idea because those resources are being leaked into the economy.

3021040,0,t3_2us2ur,In a previous Dev Blog some PP content was to be polled for FP but due to bad feedback most of it was scrapped except Teleblock spell which failed the poll. However everything else in the Dev Blog wasnt polled can we poll following content Bronze through rune boots  They would have more value and use from FP players because they are seldom used by PP players because players level up quicker due to quests and overall better items. There is a very low bracket of lower levels on PP servers. PP players would benefit equally by getting a bit more cash for their slayer drops. Yew short bows  I dont feel that a bit more accuracy would hurt. Im not entirely sure if rune arrows is a good or bad idea but those can remain members only. Teleblock  Theres almost zero risk of dying in FP wilderness if you are capable of teleporting when at  wilderness or lower. I feel this would give incentive for players to get  magic and add more risk to pking. Mystic armor  This would include all colors. Melee has rune armor and rangers have green dhide while mages have literally a piece of garment that gets wrecked by everything. Wizard hat and Wizard robe top the blue skirt gives zero magic bonus Again this would help give more value to slayer drops which benefits PP just as equally. Attack and defense potions  FP already has strength potions and even the ability to make them indirectly by bringing the Apothecary in Varrock some ingredients. Attack and defense potions are rarely made or used by members i feel the boosts on FP isnt significant enough to be game changing. Air water earth and fire wave spells  Rangers can hit rapid s with adamant arrows and melee can hit rapid s with rune scimitar while only wielding two items and a strength amulet that costs nearly nothing. Both of those classes out dps magic. Blood runes would gain more value as they would be in high demand in FP due to members mainly using tridents.,2007scape,cob4mju,3,t5_2wbww

3021647,0,t3_2us3qo,Its called the martingale strategy in casino games such as roulette. The famous saying is it works until it doesnt. Basically your chances of doubling your initial cash pile are the same as hitting a streak long enough to bankrupt you. this is independant of starting cash and starting wager no matter how slow you go by having a small starting wager and how much money you have its all relative. This is also why most online casinos have minimums and maximums on tables like roulette to prevent people from making bots that bet like . at the start and double each time always betting on black or red until it wins then resetting. Of course you can still streak a loss but starting at say . and having a  bankroll puts you at a significant advantage of profiting even if its very little like  or so. ,2007scape,cob6vyu,3,t5_2wbww

3027916,0,t3_2uumq1,How is the community?The community in my opinion isnt the greatest. Lately they have been a bit more on the bad attitude side of things because of the current updates that are coming or are already here. I still see a few posts every once in awhile on this sub complaining about how maple logs look terrible. It has been two weeks and people still complain. Even if they do look out of place the community did vote for it. But this is mainly only on the reddit side of the community. If youre okay with a few posts a day complaining about every little detail then this side of the community wont be bad at all. The ingame side is a complete  shot. Many times I will have a great conversation with people and then sometimes I will be doing barrows or any other PvMMinigame and people will say Hope you die or Nice fail account etc. It just depends on what the attitude of the player youre talking with like any other game.Is it active?Yes we have had a lot of days recently where we have broke  players online. I expect a big boost when FP comes out. Is trading difficult without GE Specifically lowlevel specialist items for skilling etc.We have Zybez and the trading post half the time people who posted on it have their private on friends. Ive been playing since launch though and I havent had any problems with trading. The only thing that gets me is during the night prices seem to go up supply and demand. You wont have to worry about this issue soon though so dont let this be a factor that makes you not want to join.Does Jagex support it that much anymore?We actually have an amazing group of JMods who actually post regularly on this sub. They also do live streams to show off some new contenttest out thingsdo community events. Follow their Twitch here They also have Twitter accounts where they often post updates as well. Follow them on Twitter here | Watch out for fake accounts they are only there to phish you.Does the community get a say in what gets addedwhat doesnt? percent everything is polled. You can vote in game at the poll booths by banks or you can vote on the oldschool website.Are minigames active?I cant really comment on this one maybe some other people can help you out on that one. The only minigame I can for sure say is active is Pest Control. Check out iEmz PC post about pest control here You can also just join the clan chat iEmz PC and the world will be posted in the Talking inIs there anything else you can say to either encourage me or discourage me?This game is fun and there is new content that has been pumped into it.

I still wouldnt have the stats if it werent for NMZ in fact Id have quit long ago.If it werent for afk NMZ youd see a lot of people who had good accounts in RS quit gradually...

3232947,0,t1_cox30lh,A lot of off topic to consider here.The J mods talked about how the idea to OSRS started and IIRC mod reach said he posted the idea as a semi joke on their internal forums a year before it got released. Not very important my point is that this is a game they love and want to make the best of.They added bonds with FP because thats the only way for them to offer FP as well as keeping their income stable the coming years. Introducing fp  less members over time. Bonds  increased income. Also a lot of people wanted bonds to pay safely for their membership through their in game wealth. It was a fair poll. It was either fp with bonds or no fp and no bonds. They couldnt offer it separately. Also bonds are not pay to win. Theyre RWT. People will always RWT. Its an option with bonds a legal one and you dont have to take part of it. I wont. I agree that splashing and AFK NMZ is a huge problem and it bothers me a lot that it exist. I think that the OSRS team is divided in their opinion about it. I hope they get rid of it. But its not like theyre not aware of it and they must have their reason for keeping it the way it is. Theyre very vocal about OSBuddy. Theyre not officially supporting it but aside from that they work closely with the people who make OSBuddy and they approve every single update thats made to it. More than one OSRS J mod uses OSBuddy.Swapping was something Runescape and OSRS supported from the start as long as everyone is aware that it involves trust trading. ,2007scape,cox3mxa,1,t5_2wbww

There is no cap on what your wealth can be ... there is a cap on what your XP can be and on top of that very few people actually care about XP after reaching the max level.As I said before you could literally do this on as many accounts as you wanted and trade it to your main without breaking any in game rules there is no way you could do this with xp ...

3306352,0,t1_cp54mg7,I disagree.Youre supposed to give FPers a little demo of the content they could receive if they were members just like what we do with Quests.We give FPers about  quests which hugely rewarded them free AlKharid gate unlocking Rune Platebody unlocking the Runecrafting skill k XP in Smithing etc. Once FPers realise how much Quests can positively benefit their gameplay theyd want to do more  hence itll convince them to become a member.The same should be done for Achievement Diaries. The journey of training and skilling in order to meet the requirements for a diary task is satisfying in the end. And upon completing all the tasks getting the rewards is amazing. For FPers to go through a similar journey and get rewarded with the best FP item in the Ring Slot  the Explorers Ring it will definitely make them want to do more Diaries.If you dont give FPers a demo on what theyre missing out on theyre never going to care for it.When I first started playing RuneScape as a kid I stayed as an FP for about  years. Even though half the skills were unlocked for me I didnt care about them since I never knew what they did or how theyd benefit me in any way. I never felt the need to subscribe for extra skills because I wasnt aware I was even missing out on much.It wasnt until the FP Achievement Diary that I got my first membership subscription.,2007scape,cp55f83,30,t5_2wbww

I previously thought it was  damage but I do not know which bonuses determines the accuracy of this hit  if any.Discharging the shield of course decreases its defense. Edit The recommended way to charge a DFS is by taking long range hits from metal dragons. You then get one charge per attack you receive. ,2007scape,cpgflcy,1,t5_2wbww

3429762,0,t3_2zgrm0,I had the exact same issue when I was in high school and had absolutely no clue how to get around it. I didnt feel safe using a free VPN nor did I want to pay for one which also doesnt necessarily mean its secure.One thing that worked for a while at my school was that I could go into the IP settings of my network adapter and change my DNS to Google DNS or something else because my schools method of blocking things was via OpenDNS and their blocking services. After a while this stopped working because I guess the administration caught on to this and told the IT department to make it so it wasnt possible they had decided not to force DNSes to make it easier for them to allow teachers to bypass it by deploying images to faculty systems which defaulted to Google DNS. Because of this they had to now force OpenDNS for all traffic.Before I continue with a method to bypass this have you actually gone to talk to the IT peopleSysadmins at their office? Most IT departmentsSysadmins at schools are pretty chill and only really do things because the school tells them to. It may be worth your while to just go in and ask if they would be willing to unban itwhitelist your MAC address to RuneScaperelated blocks. Just tell them that youd rather be doing something enjoyable that allows you to relax instead of sitting around and looking at the wall with nothing to do. Its worth a try.If you dont want to try that or you already have there is another way if you have a router at home. If you dont have a router at home there is always the publicpaid private VPN option but I still would advise against it. Some companies are really good about security but I just dont feel comfortable transmitting all of my data through an entity where anyone could easily grabwatchlog passwords or personal information.If you do have a router at home an option would be to look into setting up your own VPN on your home router.I did some research and found that I could install custom firmware on my era router called DDWRT and it included the ability to set up whats called OpenVPN. It allowed me to make my connection SCHOOL gt HOME ROUTER gt RUNESCAPE instead of SCHOOL gt RUNESCAPE so unless the IT department decided to ban outbound traffic to my home router it would just appear that I was transmitting stuff to my house and all resolving went through my house and the DNSes I selected there instead of through the school and their DNSes so keyworddomainIP filters would be bypassed.It sounds a bit complicated but I was able to do it without any previous experience in networking by following guides found through Google.Try logging in to your routers configuration page at home and see if it has the ability of setting up a VPN. Its much safer than using a publicprivate VPN service since your traffic cant be easily intercepted by possiblyshady VPN hosts and also its free. Not only that but you would also be much closer and as long as it was a good connection the ping would be much better than a VPN hosted in a datacenter many many miles away. If your routers stock firmware cant support that you could look into installing custom firmware like I did this is a bit dangerous and can brick your router so be very careful and follow all guides very thoroughly that has the ability to set up OpenVPN or something similar.Once you have determined that you can set up a VPN or installed custom firmware that can follow instructions by searching for something on Google like OpenVPN ltRouter modelfirmware namegt setup. With no former experience in networking I was able to easily install custom firmware set everything up in OpenVPN and connect to it from school by just Googling for things like OpenVPN how to connect OpenVPN setup OpenVPN config etc.I would offer to help with setting that stuff up but a lot of it is different depending on the router and the chips they use so I wouldnt really know the best things to do with routers Im unfamiliar with.Good luck!,2007scape,cpj7vow,0,t5_2wbww

3431248,0,t1_cpj9ipe,Late last year Mod Balance and Mod Infinity made comments about Auto Hot Keys and mousekeys specifically whether or not they were agianst the rules. A few RuneScapers werent satisfied with their response to the situation and so we escalated the issue to our anticheating specialists who have confirmed that their statements were correct.They have confirmed thatMousekeys i.e. the windows accessibility tool is allowed it always has been anything else is third party software and is not. If the team see evidence that a player is using AHKs supermousekeys or any other versions of this macroing software then they will take action against them. If a player is using normal mousekeys they wont. The team are perfectly capable of detecting both and telling the different between them.When it comes to skilling mousekeys can potentially give an advantage when it comes to emptying the inventory quickly however this requires a certain level of skill though the following section of macroing rule is quite clear in regards to this behaviourSoftware that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses.Now mousekeys do not generate input as that is done by the user it doesnt automatically move the mouse pointer to a specified coordinate it moves it at a steady pace in the direction specified by the key pressed  or  and stops doing so when the key is released. It doesnt generate mouse clicks as that is done by the user pressing  and it doesnt generate key presses. Without augmentation or modification adjusting the inbuilt settings is not augmentation or modification and is fine mousekeys are not capable of violating the rules against third party software.

3654703,1,t1_cq8ue3j,I think the mods are doing a fantastic job. The game is the most popular it has ever been weve seen some of the biggest updates the game has had just these past few months in regards to FP the Grand Exchange and Achievement Diaries. These all took massive efforts from the JMods yes even your arch rivals Ronan and Chris.   Yet we still find ways to criticize this game. I understand Nightmare Zone and Splashing but the team has replied to this matter time and time again. If something is going to change they will let us know. There is no reason to post every  hours on this subreddit about the matter.   In regards to Ronan. Are you serious? His job is COMMUNITY MANAGER. He is supposed to be on everything social media related for the oldschool team. Twitch streams this subreddit twitter the forums thats where he is supposed to be! You seem to think he only tries to troll around and only replies to positive threads. Have you taken a look at his reddit account? Everyday he responds to dozens of question about the game. These threads do not make it to the front page but because everyone here seems to think whatever is on the front is the only thing that matters. He is supposed to constantly interact and help the community that is his job.   If you really think you know how to make this game better send in your application to Jagex im sure youll be a wonderful candidate. Dont feel like doing that? Post a problem here on the subreddit and post a possible solution to it as well. If you REALLY affected that much by what the JMods are doing then I do not know what game you are playing. The constant harassment of them on here is unbelievable seeing a thead every day saying somewhere on the team is not worth having is so fucking naive.   Give it a rest please. ,2007scape,cq8v1n9,7,t5_2wbww

3707527,1,t1_cqeun10,Why exactly would RS not work without skill levels? If you want to hold your prestige in your ability to grind skills I suggest you stick to the main game.The idea of training skills or completing quests in a survival style game simply doesnt work. It requires far too much of an investment for the new player to place themselves on an equal level as other players. If players are required to relevel their skills every time they die it will just reach a point where these players are preyed on before they are able to put up a fighting chance and once theyre killed of course its back to square one. This time investment just fundamental doesnt work for survival games. Can you imagine if in HZ you had to spend a week grinding learning to build a gun? The game would be dead nobodys willing to put that amount of time to make their character viable especially when theres no telling how long this character is going to last. Deadman needs players to have access to all content as soon as they spawnrespawn. This makes fishing food mining essence and crafting runes all short term goals to gather materials which allow the player to once again enter the contest for survival. Now consider that same process but with skill requirements. Are players going to be willing to invest that amount of time levelling up skills into their character every time they die? Im going to assume not. It might seem like fun at first but for the longevity of this game mode it could be detrimental.Finally please remember that this is at its core a PvP survival game mode. Do we really want to put more barriers between players and balanced PvP?,2007scape,cqevt9u,0,t5_2wbww

3741108,0,t3_339768,You clearly have absolutely no clue whats going on or how economics works. First of all deflation makes a large cash stack more impressive. Deflation means that you need less money to buy what you previously did the value of gp is growing stronger so prices are lower which means that its harder to make large amounts of money. Adding money to the game causes inflation it does not combat it. The amount of money has an inverse relationship to its value the more money in the game the less value it has this is what inflation is and why its bad.Next this economy is completely separate from the golden days. Phats were only in the millions the week they were released and quickly fell to the k range because there was a near unlimited supply due to holiday events.Third and I dont mean to be rude but have you ever played runescape? How do you not know the mechanism for gold in the game? How could there possibly be a fixed amount of gold in the game. If you chop a yew log fletch it mine  rune ess craft a nature rune and  fires and alch the bow youve added  gp into the game. This didnt come from anywhere else there is an unlimited supply of resources so there is an untapped endless amount of gold that could be brought into the game. This is why jagex created things like the construction skill which requires players to pay large sums of money to NPCs. This is called a money sink the money that is paid disappears out of the game this DOES combat inflation.,2007scape,cqiploe,1,t5_2wbww

It would give moderate raw fish based on your level make it competitive so the better you do in the game the more points  fish you receive. Points could be utilized for an outfit that either boosts catch rate or exp rate maybe coupled with a net harpoon or what have you that could increase rate on its own. My thinking here is you do it for the free fish  exp from playing then you save up for the outfit and the tool having people hoping to get both would also keep the game with a good player base. Fish fingers from rs kept me fishing for so long on that note distractions and diversions were just great in general ,2007scape,cqjwf7x,0,t5_2wbww

While looting stuff was fun it was rare to happen and I dont see that returning to OSRS really. Aside from that it was just a matter of travel speed to reclaim items and survive while grabbing.Personally Id like to see a system where we can purchase upgrades to our death timer over gravestones based on prayer level it would be like gravestones without blessing I suppose. Maybe you could even get other perks for a very high cost m even like protecting th item outside of wilderness maybe just toggles protect item on when you die if you had prayer points? or moving your items outside of boss rooms e.g. outside gwd doors outside kq room at top of dks ladder etc. Maybe not those perk exactly but something like that would be more unique that just adding gravestone.,2007scape,cqw4dbb,1,t5_2wbww

If you dont want to be at the end of the circlejerk because you cant take it leave the clan or tell your friends to grow up and mature a little.  But since we know the latter wont happen I guess its up to you.Its one thing killing PvMers its another trash talking while you kill them.  The reason you didnt say anything here was because you obviously one banged that dude and didnt have time to type out your vulgarities.As for looking for pkers thats bullshit and you know it dont hide behind your lies.  You claim to be killing PKers you come across and kill PvMers on the side.  In reality you are looking for PvMers and killing PKers on the side.  Does lying to yourself make you feel better?

Not everyone was aware of everything that occurred clans tend to have separated units when dealing with things other members are not meant to know about. I was unaware of most things that occurred along with others and it was only until videos were posted the issue was addressed. We dont control people just because the DDoSer has not DDoSed us it does not make us guilty. I have been DDoSed by SV before I never called their whole  or so man ML guilty. I called the people who done it to me guilty. Guilty by association has never worked.PttBYou are in no position to declare the number of people there were DDoSing. If he has told you that there were only twothree people DDoSing then it is his word with experience of it over yours. No teams profit if anything they degrade with a bad reputation.

4022655,0,t1_cresvog,I understand perfectly that staff costs money and adding these operating expenses removes money from net income.  What I dont understand is how they seem to think that os is going nowhere. If you dont give it the staff it needs then sure it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy but adding more staff would definitely help with player retention and reaching new players.  Additionally will removing staff from rs to add to os mean a decrease in revenues from rs?  I would imagine that rs is less focused on number of players and more focused on money per player while os assumes a constant money per player and focuses on number of players.  I would argue that because os focuses more on number of players than rs that it would make sense to have more staff per amount of revenue.  ,2007scape,creta20,2,t5_2wbww

4109399,0,t3_37phf7,This might quite possibly sound insanely dumb but I swear that my intentions are good. Would it be possible that the Abyssal Sire drops the abyssal maul and that it can be made out from the spine? Initially Im thinking that the spine of the Sire can be somewhat special and it can be made into a maul using smithing. Maybe hammer together the spine to a solid maul head making the handleshaft out of rune bars perhaps. I dont know.I just think it would be nice for the spine to be used for the maul instead of having it drop whips in addition to maul and dagger  it would devalue whips and regular abyssal demons.With the spines going to the maul instead the amount of whips entering the game will decrease instead of increase and it wont make it a straight forward decision when a player decides which monster to kill on a task.I very much approve of the suggested boss slayer changes.,2007scape,crop3cy,1,t5_2wbww

This majority wins system might not have been such a good idea because the majority is not always right. What the JMods really need to do is listen to reasoning and understand why a certain  of people want an update and not just leave it to whether its over or under  that alone doesnt make the update good for the game.,2007scape,crq1vpw,-3,t5_2wbww

4247841,0,t1_cs3dy6d,Its exaggerated because the full game is provided to a normal account. Selecting ironman and ultimate ironman modes restricts your account from parts of the game. Some people enjoy this others dont.You dont gain access to new content by deciding to be an ironman. You add a gamelevel restriction on your account. You can play as an ironman on a normal account if you want look at batys account PeckishWhale. Hell he even has a slightly different ruleset for himself where he can pick up items that hes PKed and he enjoys that so he plays that way.You could try to argue ultis lose all their items on death while normal accounts dont but Id reapond with the fact that you can drop the items you kept if you really care about enforcing the rules you put on yourself. Deadman mode if released would be the first thing that is new content that actually requires a specific account. You cant lose  levels on your skills when you die on a normal account guards arent super strong and hostile to skulls on normal accounts and you dont drop or recieve bank keys when you die or kill an opponent on a normal account.

4255277,0,t3_39pdup,I see what youre saying and agree to an extent. But having a master that assigns only bosses seems like it will be a tad OP. This would essentially make it so bosses would never be killed off task whereas having them as a random task from the current masters is like being rewarded for completing a few tasks in a row.

Back then Jagex actually had a backbone and realized that it was completely overpowered and devalued combat so they nerfed it back to fair exp rates. There was a  page thread of complaints but they stood their ground. End result people did quit but in the longterm their game surpassed the amount of members they had pre pest control nerf. I never got to use it much as I had quit slightly before it came out but I didnt give a shit when I came back because I knew it wasnt right for the longterm health of the game. Stop being selfish and realize the damage it has on the game.The sad part is NMZ is fucking afk even worse than pest control and they have yet to remove it.,2007scape,csef59c,2,t5_2wbww

4453937,0,t1_css2pw4,It was all done with this setup maxed combat stats after the update that added two new rotations and made the green phase weak to mage. I probably did get a little better over time but the average is roughly the same as the average after the first  kills.I was at about  kc at the time of that update. I took around  kills to get used to the new phases and assemble this gear then recorded these  times from  kc or so.I threw out one kill where I went in with an uncharged trident but otherwise I recorded every single time. The  happened when I was watching a stream and the streamer got a pet drop so I stopped paying attention a bit pAlso urandompersonas comment is accurate. Kill times vary by rotation and naturally by how well you hit. Also some times are much less frequent than others because Zulrah is underwater moreless often at that time. Even within  standard deviation there is a lot of variation in frequencyMost common times     Least common times          ,2007scape,css3oze,3,t5_2wbww

A player with defence would rarely be able to three hit a pure as they lacked the combat stats to do so. On the other hand the pure had three chances to hit big and usually did especially since all weapons had the same attack speed making rh the weapon of choice in fp.Since then pures became a part of Runescape combat and have thus outgrown its original purpose of beating the defence guys with their rune loots to just pking each other for fun.,2007scape,ct4c4r4,2,t5_2wbww

4591816,0,t1_ct9bt91,thats how spears already work. if youre hp and they deal  damage before your prayer hit s you keep your ags. What happens is they spear people when they have low prayer and they have piety protect from melee and protect item activated. They dont deal him any damage and wait for his prayer to go down naturally. if is aid is on people will stat spy him  heal other him. If its not the team has to literally guess when to kill him or his x log will occur. he even says himself its a lure but still keeps his offensive prayers on instead of being safe and lets his prayer go super low.Imo they should bring something else that can smite people out like a weapon that takes off someones protect item and they have to manually put it back on.

4641215,0,t1_ctdm105,So you can buy an unsung crystal seed in the G.E. for k. You can also buy usable crystal equipment bows and shields in the G.E. as well. You can take the unsung crystal seed to an NPC and have her sing it into a bow or a shield for a certain amount of money which will have a lower cost the more you sing the crystal into new equipment.My genius idea was to buy these crystal seeds have the NPC sing them into bows the bows sell for about k the first fee from the NPC is k the second fee is k third k fourth k fifth k. My thought process was hey I do this enough times Ill very clearly make a profit.The reality though is that when you have the NPC sing the crystal it creates a Crystal Bow FULL which is untradable. In order to sell crystal bows you have to get a Crystal Bow NEW which is purchased individually from a different NPC for k each. So after doing the process of buying  bows which costed over m I was stuck with  Crystal Bow Full which I cannot trade or sell.  Ill be using them for Dagannoth Kings and possibly Jad. Its a decent weapon because it doesnt use ammo and has very long range  tiles compared to shortbows  longbows  and crossbows  although truth be told Id have been much happier being stuck with  crystal shields but lesson learned.,2007scape,ctflbb4,1,t5_2wbww

Come up with undeniable truth  right now it is completely unprofitable to go there when evaluating time spent to kill boss  minutes  go and back  minutes and supplies you need for one kill spend around k. In one hour you can make up to  kills and in average get around Kh loot from it. By excluding costs it would be around k gp profit per hour. Also need to take into consideration that there are quite a lot of pkers starting from  GMT till late night which hugely impact your ability to kill boss.Furthermore taking pkers into consideration it is worth to emphasize that with a recent changes in world switching it is incredibly easy for  man team to scout all worlds in more or less  minutes. Knowing that the time needed to kill boss is  minutes you have possibility of finishing boss approximately  out of  if there is one team. What if there are more teams? Hope Jagex will make changes which will result Vetion to be more attractive place to go.

If the market continues to value items for their utility at prices above the price floor the price floor might as well not even exist. Suppose the market decides blowpipes cost m and scales cost ea. It doesnt follow that visages and magic fangs have to cost m if this update passes. The minimum they can cost is m the price of  scales but they can cost literally whatever the market decides above m. If its exactly m thats fine. Visages at m Magic Fangs at m Blowpipes at m and scales at ea is a totally viable equilibrium. I cant buy  magic fangs and convert them to a blowpipe so theres no arbitrage.,2007scape,ctmi1v6,0,t5_2wbww

What I used to play day in and day out was a game called Flyff I thought it was super fun. It had its flaws it was super grindy cash shop with a few pay  win things glitches etc. But the game was still able to hold a very large player base which is what had me coming back all those years. However the game has now died because according to a friend who continued to play after I stopped the economy turned to complete shit. The server I played on probably has less than  people online now it used to have a few thousand. So I think we should strongly consider the impact of a bad economy on a game.

Also a crown or something on the leaders name.       A small image in the corner showing which team is wearing which Serp helm Also make it a rule to wear red or blue as determined before the match begins no switching    Fix the bug where players who are viewing from the orbs are visible standing in the orb during the match as its confusing    I really enjoy watching these matches.

4864880,0,t1_cu7qp7p,I apologize that you have real life things to do during the summer but since Im going to college and only working part time I dont have those responsibilities. Its completely normal for a video game to focus on decent updates during the summer to bring in players that are bored and decide to give the game a shot and hopefully keep those players. Theres a difference between having to test an update and waiting until the last minute to develop it. Ash just finished developing it today when its been in the works for over  months. Im sorry but no theres a massive difference between that and a quest being delayed because it needs more testing. Its not like the quest was in development for  months and they delayed it by  weeks because they never actually started it.Ive understood that Jagex still needs to test the update which means they cant force rush it out but its still upsetting that they didnt get it out earlier. Take that how you will I dont care either way. God bless.,2007scape,cu7r7dq,-6,t5_2wbww

So mathematically speaking the berserker ring data is very very slightly more accurate than the warrior ring data which proves that at least against black demons the warrior ring is better than the berserker ring.I will have to test this out against weaker enemies such as lesser demons or basilisks as well as more defensive enemies like metal dragons. It probably is the case where tankier enemies like black demons will benefit more from the warrior ring than the berserker ring but I wanted to actually test it out.,2007scape,cu92jq9,1,t5_2wbww

This allows the anti pk detection to become better and faster. Each time you start the script it will remove your username from the blacklist if you are added and load all other pkers that have been flagged for pking. Now instead of waiting for the player to attack you itll instantly add them to blacklist teleport world hop and then resume botting. This allows pkers nearly impossible to PK you and makes the script stable. The longer you run the script the better the script runs.,2007scape,cuecrod,1,t5_2wbww

4947580,0,t3_3io4ji,The terms extortion and blackmail are often used interchangeably although there are differences. Extortion is the illegal and intentional use of threats to ones person or property coercion or fraudulent claims of right of public duty such as impersonating a police officer for the purpose of taking money goods property services or some other thing of value from a victim against hisher will. These threats can be those of violence physical harm criminal prosecution or public exposure of harmful or secret information that would damage a persons reputation andor standing in the community. When the threat is to reveal embarrassing harmful andor shameful information about the victim to hisher friends coworkers associates family members or to the public in general this is generally defined as blackmail and is usually considered a type of extortion. What is Extortion Law? The act of extortion is considered a felony in most U.S. States punishable by fine incarceration probation or parole and restitution payable to the victims. When a public official extorts someone by misusing hisher official position to obtain some advantage profit or benefit it is called extortion under color of official right. The legal definition of the crime of extortion varies from state to state. In some states only acts of extortion performed by public officials is charged under the crime of extortion while these acts when committed by a private individual are charged as blackmail. When interstate commerce is involved in an act of extortion either physically or by use of computers internet phone or mail it may be charged as a federal crime. Whether or not the threat is carried out does not determine whether the crime of extortion has been committed. As long as a verbal written or printed threat is made there is intention to purposefully or willfully carry out the threat and the victim reasonably believes that the threat is real this is sufficient. Additionally the threat can be directed toward someone other than the intended victim such as hisher family member or loved one. Extortion is closely related to bribery and robbery since they are all forms of theftlarceny. However with robbery the money or property is taken by force or intimidation against the victims will and without hisher consent. Although rare in some states the crime of extortion can also result in a civil lawsuit for damages under tort law. In these cases it is necessary to show proof of the threat or violence proof that the extortion resulted in damageinjury and that the person being sued caused the damage. To consult State Legislation regarding extortion laws and regulations please see the Criminal Code by State page Copyright HG.org Extortion Law  US USC    Penalty for ExtortionEvery officer of the customs who demands or receives any other or greater fee compensation or reward than is allowed by law for performing any duty or service required from him by law shall be liable to a penalty of  for each offense recoverable to the use of the party aggrieved.ABA  Criminal Justice SectionMembership in the ABA Criminal Justice Section brings with it many benefits and privileges.

The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense.The Hobbs ActThe U.S. Federal Law prohibiting actual or attempted robbery or extortion affecting interstate or foreign commerce.The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations RICO ActU.S. Federal law that established additonal criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for racketeering activity.

4962209,0,t1_cujw00d,I disagree entirely I think this is exactly what the skillcape buffs should be if theyre ever implemented.They need to be useful enough to have a reason to wear one over something else in the relevant skill unless theres a specific item in that slot which overrates it. For example the Hunter buff You see an impling you want to catch so you run to the bank and search Hunter instead of searching for both impling jar and butterfly net. This frees you of the need to actually get impling jars and is also a little quicker.Is it OP? No. Is it necessary? No. Is it useful? Probably not. Is it something that you might use a few times? Sure. Thats what the target should be. Specific instances where this cape would be better than something else or very small buffs  la the Woodcutting cape.The worst case scenario from these buffs would be they see as much use as they do right now. The best case scenario is that theyre used in cases where other things are relevant but worse you need an easy quest and ? range for Avas Accumulator but you need  for range cape which is a bigger achievement.Id much prefer the prospects to be that the buffs barely do anything than the buffs make other content redundant  worse. The Prayer cape is really toeing the line but the rest are fine in my opinion. Underpowered is much better than overpowered in cases like this.,2007scape,cuk0x5t,73,t5_2wbww

5024269,0,t3_3jrah4,I know a lot about pking so Im gonna try to answer everythingYes pking is active.  has active edge pking although its not my favourite. World  is active for pure zerker mid level and main bridding  nhing join zerk birds cc and world  he has active risk fighting which can be easy money if youre a good pker.As for pvm you can literally any boss in the game as a zerker if you have  range and  attack helps because you can use ags or sgs. You can solo most bosses but you would probably need to duo Arma with a  def friend as well as man Corp with max mains youd be ranging with ruby bolts. Obviously you cant tank bandos p but you could go with acb Arma book full void and rake in kills my friend has  bandos  kc on his pure and  zammy. Also he has  Sara at  defence so a zerker is even better because of void.,2007scape,curm6fq,2,t5_2wbww

I could definitely believe the image was true provided substantial evidence that which would link the OSBuddy Dev to that particular Runescape account and Im sure its out there its just no one has provided it yetHowever even with that out of the way I still wouldnt find that substantial enough reason to completely stop using OSB. Mistakes are made and to stop using osbuddy because of this one off incident is akin to quitting runescape because MMK says Well legal botting brings us money.gtIf youre willing to take the risk of trusting your information with a seedy client with an even worse history thats your call.I wouldnt so much say seedy... the OSB devs are making an extremely comfortable amount of money off of OSB Pro and to risk that by hurting their own users through hacking them? Its far to ridiculous to be true although it it certainly a possibility. Not to mention the OSB devs hadhave direct contact with Moderators at Jagex and used to? run plugins by Jagex before submitting them apologies dont have a source for that statement!. Ill have to take it with a grain of salt that such a thing is true.Lastly before you bring up the ol OSBuddy makes the game to easyI agree.If anything I would love to see Jagex put a ban to osbuddy along with all the other easyscape sorry things like NMZ splashing a Zulrahwyvern nerf.

5034433,0,t1_cusu0p9,The LeafBladed Sword is effective a Dragon Shortsword stat wise I think the estimated Dragon Sword stats were lower attack and higher strength so it is very comparable. Because of this it is one of the best stab weapons in the game especially for its level.The Brackish Blade was the same as a Dragon Scimitar but for Stab which is pretty much a LeafBladed Sword with  more Strength so it kinda just outclasses it as the better stab weapon. I believe the Brackish Blade was also easier to use since it didnt have the Slayer requirement. It would also hurt the Zammy Hasta value a bit in OSRS but if it degraded I think it could work well along side both weapons.,2007scape,cusu9oz,1,t5_2wbww

5076930,0,t3_3kjriu,Honestly I understand but I think it would of been cool to have a new skill in the game plus you wouldnt of even needed to train it to access most of the islands since someone else could take you I really dont want to see it released as a minigame because mini games are a repetitive task for rewards in a shop and sailing doesnt fit that role.,2007scape,cuxymlp,1,t5_2wbww

If you start running barrows and like it consider trying to complete Morytania hard diaries as theyll give you a great tele to the barrows area.Other than that Id recommend green drags just because the trips will be faster with your agility level.

This is Runescape in the end theres only so much they can do. I think puzzles are fine for minigames and quests but not for skills. Skill take so long that youd  know the puzzle by heart  of the way there like in dungeoneering. Without puzzles the skill would just click and wait to do combat or woodcutting or cooking. We have  skills that already do that. I could give many more reasons but I dont think anyone takes the opinion of a redditor seriously anyway.

How does that make the game better?And more importantly how does changing anything affect you or anyone? I promise you no one will miss  def experience. No one will be upset that pures will be able to accessorize. People like you make me embarrassed to be a part of a community. People that dont look at the intention and purpose of the game and just look at the ability or whatever. You seem to forget that this game is played by people. But what disgusts me most is the intentional dismissal of other peoples values and refusal to change things based on your own views. And for heavens sake its cosmetic. Different colored chaps having a decoration in your house that no one will see anyways or access to game content such as Ape Atoll. Is this seriously something you need to take away from someone else? Does it affect you? Does it detract from anything?All your opinion does is divide the community and create negativity and animosity. And honestly I fully understand because like I said I am embarrassed to be in this community. ,2007scape,cv6doxc,3,t5_2wbww

These types of scripts can technically be considered  depending on how you define . Also you have to remember that AHK is a macro program plain and simple. Even a simple script to mimic mousekeys doesnt do exactly the same thing mousekeys do. You press a key and most AHK scripts used here will instantly jump from position x to position y. If you physically move your mouse OR using mousekeys you are moving albeit very fast from x to xxxx... to y. AHK scripts even ones that are widely considered legal like inventory droppers cut out dozens of steps in the process of moving the mouse.,2007scape,cvekny0,2,t5_2wbww

5232957,0,t3_3mmraw,My two cents  I still havent read all of the deadman infoFightingBank Raiding should be replaced for dropping everything we are currently holding. No safe items. This is a mode where we pave our way we make our choices. If I want to keep my things safe in the bank so be it. They shouldnt be up for grabs. I should only lose whatever Im risking in the nosafe zones. If I dont take anything of course I wont have a lot of sucess when getting attack. What will I do to fix it? I will probably go to my BANK and get better gear so I can at least have a chance.If I dont well I guess I will have to deal with it and keep dieing and dieing.SkulledDeadman mode give us more freedom to do our choices and to deal with the consequences  a free open world. So we dont turn this into a deathmatch festival in my opinion there should be an more severe system to keep things in check.Everyone should attack everyone. The catch is the skull timer. The skull time would increase with the gap of the attacker and the attacked. Im not talking about minutes or hours. For all I know if a level  killed a lvl  he should be skulled for a week. Skulls wouldnt give acess to any bank any cities nothing. If someone traded with the person skulled he would be skulled for the same time he was. To a certain extend this should be a fix to mules since they could be killed as well. It would be fun knowing we had to survive for a week with the things on us. This duration of skulled time would be ingame time btw.TeleportIf skulled we cant teleport to cities.Also keep them but give them a shared cooldown. If I teleport to Varrock I can only teleport to somewhere else after  mins   hour.Adding to that we should increase the cost of teleports. A special mat or more runes. P.S.I dont know how banks are but they should be local. This in junction with the increase of cooldown and price of teleports will counter the mule aspect.Sorry for my english. I wrote this in a rush and it isnt as well my native language.I can discuss and expand these ideas by pms.,2007scape,cvgrfqy,7,t5_2wbww

5236798,0,t1_cvh7pt6,Not really. Shortbows dont work in the same way as the Dark Bow and I dont think the two specials should be compared. Shortbows are fast with low damage but usually pretty good DPS. The Dark Bow is just a very slow but high damage ko spec and a worthless weapon.The purpose of my Seercull buff is to make it a worthwhile weapon in general and give it a better but still niche special attack. The higher damage with magic draining could make it useful in some situations but overall it probably wouldnt be the most useful special. Not all special attacks need to be amazing or on par damage wise and I think this would fit what the Seercull is without making it the new Dark Bow.Also does anyone really use back to back specials?

Depending on how the firs phase goes how many minions  damage taken if it was quick and good I just shadow blitz one extra time and safe spot whatever minions are there. Then finish the last vent and get ready. Also if you are stuck on the healing phase with the green beam going up before explosion I feel the pain. Sometimes I have trips that I just hit  and he heals  hp every . Fucking a pain. Ive had to go from hp at start. And then he was . Like FUCK. But I try blood blitzing him because its helpful to heal and he is generally weak to Mage. Finally the best way Ive figured to deal with this is to DDS him right away. I save my spec for the first two hits to him. Fully potted and piety. Bandos or which I like better and dont know why is dh plate v skirt. Its better somehow. At least for me.

5319310,0,t1_cvrjw87,Yeah Ive met some really interesting people so far.  Its funny to watch all of the shittalking when it takes  people to kill me.  Ive experimented with different escape routes and found that running to the altar and closing the door behind me usually gives me enough time to log out before they get the chance to catch up and open the door.  The only times this hasnt worked is when they come from the west but its almost always from the north.  I keep myself positioned slightly southwest of the bosss spawn and take a few extra seconds to lure him more towards me.  It seems that it gives me just enough time to make it to the altar so I can log.  Again I love the simplicity of this guide.  Despite it being a rather straightforward boss without a guide everything that needs to be explained is straightforward and you dont waste any time discussing anything that is unnecessary.  I just watched your Venenatis guide and it is just as good as this one.  It would be awesome to see more guides done like this and I look forward to seeing more of your videos in the future!,2007scape,cvrlra8,1,t5_2wbww

5328708,0,t1_cvsslxc,Or maybe... some people just like gambling? I dont even understand that argument if something is profitable then people are going to do that to get an advantage in the game. That has nothing to do with RWT. It just happens to be so that you need GP to do RWT therefore the most profitable methods are always going to be the most efficient RWT methods. If we continue this line of thought we arrive at the conclusion that the only way to eliminate RWT is to eliminate profit. Jagex has already tried that before but this gamemode is supposed to be the opposite of that thing they tried back then. ,2007scape,cvssxyg,0,t5_2wbww

Im glad to see that Adam is going to carry on with his forfeits and that streamers effected by it arent turning nasty. As easy it would be to turn nasty and try and stop him doing it its a lot better to take the higher road and let him get on with it.

5370998,0,t3_3ol6te,Currently there are  types of rare prestige items boss pets mutagens and champion scrolls with skilling pets being added soon. All are very similar in obtaining and purpose even if they differ in appearance. I wouldnt mind seeing more rare trim kit style drops like Mutagens more rare pets or even more champion scrolls are still  champions of champions left.However the important thing to remember is that these are prestige items and as  such they are just for looks and showing off and not something with useful stats or bonuses. Untradeables with increased stats is something totally different and I really wouldnt want to see them as uber rare drops from bosses since it puts players who dont kill that boss at a big disadvantage.I would like to see more untradeable items with minor benefits like if there was a rare chance of getting an untradeable barrows item from barrows and all it did was degrade twice as low or not at all. Or if there was new high level skilling armor with a tradeable version that degraded to dust but an untradable version that degraded more slowly and could be repaired. Although I suppose you could just have a tradeable armor from high level skilling that degrades to dust but if you had the level you could repair it for a lower cost than making it to still give an advantage to having the level without making a separate item...So yah more prestige items like mutagens and pets would be nice. But Id rather not see untradeables with better stats than tradable versions. Instead Id rather see some that have minor effects that didnt make them more powerful but more useful like less degrading.,2007scape,cvy7eki,0,t5_2wbww

There is no such thing as specific rules to what you can and cannot do. If they did that wed see loopholes. Thats why NO GAME COMPANY goes into depth on PURPOSE.None of you seem to understand I could write an ENTIRE BOT in runescape using AHK. I could also write something that says hello world! in ahk. If you start writing you cant do x y and z then people will start doing a b and c instead. The rules are vague for a reason so retards dont get around it and claim the high ground. AHK can be useful or it can be a legit bot.I use AHK to RC withdraw extremely fast. AKA within under . of a second. If I get banned I wont complain. Stop complaining.,2007scape,cw7vu9e,9,t5_2wbww

5598211,0,t1_cwqyv5u,Theres plenty to do as a nonmember! Id still recommend questing but killing cows in Lumbridge or Falador is a great way to grind out some quick cash and levels. I personally always start with training range but theres no wrong way to go. The benefit to range is that there are lots of places to hide and safely kill monsters without having to take damage and waste money on food. In FP hill giants are the best place to train once you have  range. If you head west from the GE youll see a little shack that requires a brass key to open. Down the ladder are hill giants and a little dungeon. ,2007scape,cwr0f8q,1,t5_2wbww

5603150,1,t1_cwrk5hq,have to agree. played it for an hour and it was likeoh i should get up no wait ill just lose all the progress... train... no cause all the stuff i get will get pked...I love the concept of being able to take people shit from the bank but maybe its a bit too much? and the loss of xp on death means that you never have anything to fall back on.If it takes you  hours to get your levels up it can take you  seconds to lose all that progress? how is that fun for anybody but the pkers? and what happens when the pkers start dying? Like just swap top  items to  items of the top  most valuable in bank so you have a slim chance to keep your money but lose your whip or your stack or runes but not all of it.Another thing is that skills take sooooooo fucking long to level up why not make it that all of your skills xp gets dropped down as far as possible without losing a level and then some of your skills lose a small amount of xp i dont know how much xp you lose now but it looks like a fucking lot so its easy to just die  times in one day and lose weeks of hard work.,2007scape,cwrmhz2,2,t5_2wbww

I was gunning for a top  spot on the frontpages but I came down with the worst stomachinfection Ive ever had in my life. I decided to soldier it out though I used my laptop while laying in bed shaking from my fever and the constant change between sweating and freezing barraging me some fucking rock lobsters to get my charms. Gains HAD to be had Note I had just turned  back then. Well with full ballin mage gear master wand ahrims infinity boots seers the fucking works back then and about K ice barrage casts in my inventory I blacked out  midway through luring the rocklobsters.I came to about  minutes later but gravestones only lasted  minutes max back then if memory serves me right atleast so by the time I got back to the spot essentially all the way to dagannoth kings my items were long gone.

5705479,0,t1_cx4b319,Im not suggesting a few guards patrolling Im talking nerfed versions of the guards we got now where  spawn next to you when youre skulled.  Just maybe reduce the damage level and the amount of times they will freeze you.  Make it so they do damage but not untankable damage.  And a player can attack you while the guards are and all  of them can attack you at once even in single.And furthermore if they can pull a clan with  skulled players well theres probably over  players on a server much of the time.  Once their location is known where are they going to run and where are they going to hide?   beats .  People are just soooo afraid of clans but they dont think about the natural advantage that unskulled players have over skulled thats only getting bigger with recent updates. With the  XP update and likely the  XP update that is proposed there is a big incentive to stay unskulled while pking and to hunt skulled players for a living.  And theres a natural tendency to do that skull hunting in very large teams that can handle a clan of pretty much any size.  When no one in the team has a skull its pretty easy to trust casual groupings of people.  The first player or subgroup to try to backstab will stick out like a sore thumb in a large team.  What you think is going to happen to them . sec after they get that skull?   loss of XP in locked stats thats what.  Coming soon to DMM near you.,2007scape,cx4bjbg,1,t5_2wbww

This would limit the potential for misclicks team capes and also stop the issue of suiciding. However this change could be made so that players outside of guarded zones are still able to attack players who are inside thus making guarded banks such as camelot and seers a similar level of risk.,2007scape,cx5l7s7,-1,t5_2wbww

5726692,0,t1_cx6x6qy,The scales were intended to be something unique to Zulrah to give it a steady profit. If we were to make fishing the best way to gain scales it goes against that. It doesnt matter what your thoughts on Zulrah are they are going to be balancing its drops in due time regardless of this update.Also if fishing does have a big impact on the scales and crash their prices then wed end up with alch price BiS items with a low cost to use which is worse than our current situation. The point of adding another source of scales was to make it so getting more scales doesnt mean bringing in more unique items not to replace Zulrah as the primary source of scales.As for the exp and profit I said for it to be roughly the same as Monkfish not worse. The exp rates I gave were estimates not the exact amounts. I was also talking more from the base level and not at  fishing which would likely be higher exp. If Scale Fishing is comparable to Monkfishing players will do it for the same reason they fish Monkfish. If we make it better than Monkfish than that gives more incentive for players to do it which means a higher supply of scales. It is a tricky balance to get right since there are a lot of factors to consider and all can have big impacts on the scale market but hopefully Mod Ash doesnt listen to the players here who want it to be k exp and k profit per hour...,2007scape,cx6ya2k,1,t5_2wbww

We all know that the vast majority of players vote based on their gut reaction to the two sentences of context in the poll question.Its upsetting to watch the future of the game get determined by circlejerk and then what does get released is buggy and unpolished because its more important that you buy membership to experience the hype than for you to stick around afterwards.Its an unsustainable model of luring the playerbase along with shiny new pieces of candy. ,2007scape,cxbw8nl,6,t5_2wbww

5798385,0,t1_cxfu7my,I know what youre saying but if an item doesnt alch for more then the cost of the nat you can still make that GP by selling it to the store where you would be LOSING gp by alching it and deflating the economy. And since the store gives slightly higher then alch price you make less by alching the items then using the store. and like i said to him the rune would be destoryed for that money meaning natures are leaving the game and balancing out that extra ish gp gained but since no natures are being used the money AND rune are still in the game and its generating money WITHOUT using a rune which inflates the amount of GP in the game without increasing the usage of the runes and then the bot makes MORE money because they dont need to buy runes.So its the same for the overall economy but a lot of extra gp for the bot who is then going to sell that gold and while it may not seem like extra in the entire economy indivually it makes a big difference since they have no investment cost.you can also buy natures from a shop,2007scape,cxfuf86,1,t5_2wbww

5800143,0,t3_3umksw,I like it. I think they should make a bit of a rework for the scoring and rewards system first though.As it is each resource put into the hopper things gives you  piece of eight up to a maximum of . Ontop of that each rum collected by your team gives you  pieces of eight. Things like water can be mass collected for  score in a few minutes then you can just afk the rest of the game and get  points every single game with next to no effort while the max that is pretty much possible is around  if you have a highly coordinated team to get as much rum as possible. A rum scored by the team should give  points points being the pieces of eight awarded at the end of the game and if youre the one to collect it you should get . Water shouldnt give any points. Sweetgrubs coloured water and bark should give . points each. Bitternuts should give  points. Make winning award bonus points Nerf or simply remove sabotage. Its completely overpowered to the point where you pretty much have to play no sabo games in order to score any points so it just leads to trolls sabotaging in no sabo games which is a pain in the ass. Possibly add reinforcements to pipes and pumps to make them immune for a while or simply unburnable. XP rewards should be quadrupled. Easy medium and hard clues should be added to the rewards shop at   and  pieces of eight each. White naval should be added to the rewards shop at the same cost as other naval sets. The option to upgrade the three weapons from Smith to level  instead of  for  pieces of eight each. A very rare chance of a monkey pet after completing a game maybe  in  pieces of eight awarded for example.I love trouble brewing for the gameplay and the current rewards. Its my favourite minigame but its almost completely dead and it has massive flaws to its scoring system.,2007scape,cxg29t0,5,t5_2wbww

It might be a good idea purely for rare monsterboss spawns. Where during blank hours of a daynight theres some odd  chance these creatures will spawn deformedstrongerweakerenchantedsimply different visuals which would serve as a way to make for high drop rate chance items but with low spawn rate creatures similar to wow roaming npcs that drop mounts. Say during pm and pm on a server there was a  chance green dragons spawned a version alike kbd but kgd which would wreck havok on the people around until it was killed which would drop a hefty x hidesbones noted and a  chance at a unique item special versions of green dhide that appear more spiky with scales and provide only slight bonus range attack as compared to normal green dhide  obviously nowhere near blue sets but maybe a halfway mark  ,2007scape,cxh2o4t,1,t5_2wbww

5913483,1,t1_cxus578,I dont really see where Ive contradicted myself but ok.If you would like some proof maybe check out the school sub my username is based on. Its in my flair on that board I just graduated with my degree in feb.Regardless this idea that depression can be blamed for a plethora of issues with life has not helped anyone. Creating helpless victims is not solving our obesity or mental health crisis. Obesity is calories in calories out. Depression can cause a multitude of biochemical changes in your body but it will not make you fat. You still have to overeatunderexercise to become obese. Im not sure what youre trying to say about depression. It certainly can and often does cause lifestyle changes because you often lose the desire to do anything. But thats not an excuse for overeating the same way as its not an excuse for drug abuse or criminal action or other ways people act out. What you seem to be proposing worked for you im sure but its a dangerous precedent. Blaming the ways your life is not perfect on your depression is an excellent way to  ensure things never get better. Depression doesnt just go away but you can get your life back in order regardless. Taking personal responsibility for your actions is key to this and thats impossible if you keep blaming your actions on your disorder.,2007scape,cxusgdv,1,t5_2wbww

DMM is artificially difficult through punishing on death mechanics rather then true difficulty that makes it super tedious to get built back up. runescape is a casual as fuck game dont kid yourself it isnt hardcore.

Replying to threads saying Dmm isnt for the faint of heart beware hardcore uber leet sauce game mode is hilarious when youre just taking the piss on someone else for getting ragged but would expect sympathy all the same if youre being dumpstered on because you took a risk and didnt hump a safe zone.,2007scape,cxvlp8s,3,t5_2wbww

5956533,1,t3_3x0c68,Sorry about all the people who are saying you deserved it. I dont really know how that logic holds up. It was ridiculous then and its ridiculous now. Example Last week everyone who skipped my Biology class was expelled from the school. This week I skipped my Biology class and I was expelled from the school. Does that make it okay that the University expels people for this? No. Does this mean that I deserved to be expelled because I knew the consequences to my actions? No. If you were to call any person in runescape fat or stupid or ugly you would NOT get permmuted. I think the community agrees that the punishment is too harsh. I dont think we should sit around and watch Jagex unfairly apply the rules of the game. Edit OP how could you do this to me I cant believe I defended you.

6068890,0,t1_cyf3v7m,Range was void  rune cbow  broad bolts  absorbs  overloads.  Very cheap for the XP rates you get.  Like khr depending on your range level and other gear.  And cost well under gpxp I have a spreadsheet at home but Im not there.Mage was slowest.  Mostly doing fire strike  smoke staff  void  occult  absorbs overloads are a waste with fire strike.  You can get khr but obviously super cheap.  Basically splashing with damage.  And you could use tankier armor and probably get nearly same xp rates.  I did try out black salamander but it was not much better XP and it cost a lot more and you need overloads to get best bang for buck which is less afk.  You could go for fire bolt with gauntlets for a little bit more money but I didnt want to finish that quest while I was self boosting.FYI   I would certainly not recommend mage in NMZ.  If you get diaries done you can do stuff like tan leather for much better XP rates and pretty cheap cost.  I mainly did it because I could self boost and it was really AFK and I didnt have diary done.  I would only recommend it if you would otherwise be splashing for mage XP.,2007scape,cyf4d9z,3,t5_2wbww

6069359,0,t1_cyf657q,gt but not as good as the exp you get per hour for actually Sailing.Im talking XP per hour spent actually doing the skill.  If you look at say a bush run for farming you get about k XP for running  patches of poison ivy.  And you can do them every  hours.  But it only takes  minutes to do the run with teleports.So you could say thats k XP per hour  hours spent waiting for k XP  which would agree with what you said  not very good xp per hour.  Or you could say thats k XP per hour  minutes spent working for k XP which would be pretty great as xp per hour goes for leveling a runescape skill.If sailing is like that I think that the shipbuilding will be necessary IN ADDITION to exploration for most efficient skill leveling.  And yes it will be yet another daily task I need to do so I would not support it.I would only support getting XP from shipbuilding if the XP given PER HOUR OF IN GAME TIME WORKING is less than or at least equivalent to what you get what you get from exploring.  Or else like I said if ship building is not artificially timeconstrained like farming so you can spend all day building ships without a break like you could spend all day making addy plates in smithing.,2007scape,cyf6kl4,1,t5_2wbww

She didnt know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics she couldnt figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.She got pregnant at  because she thought you couldnt get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the  year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is  now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these  years Ive followed this complete moron she has never written your when she meant youre.

Is it to do with hiscores and competition with other players? I only play the game very very sparsely these days but I dont like the microtransactions either. But I dont buy them and I dont pay any attention to the leaderboards either so I cant really say they affect me in any discernible way. This isnt just aimed at you Swankie btw more of a general question.And again Im not defending PW or anything just trying to see how far removed my own mentality is from the general population haha.,2007scape,cylkq22,0,t5_2wbww

6156227,0,t1_cypduc3,First off I would like to point out that the line between appealing and pandering is extremely blurry. Second I get that the memes are overblown and cringeworthy. My point is that if you take a look at this subreddit every other post is about how Zeah is ruined strictly for the meme dialogue. If someone who has never been to this subreddit before saw this they would immediately assume the worst aspect of this game are memes when it really isnt. I have never seen a singular thing get this much attention as the memes in Zeah. There are so many other legitimate issues with this game and it frustrates me that the tipping point of the community is fucking memes. Where was this furor for PID in PvP? Where was this furor for DDOSing? Hell where is the furor for the content in Zeah thats already DOA? I just feel like the memes are the least of this games issues yet this is all anyone want to give attention too. Imagine if we could give this much attention to an issue like the D spear spec. Im in no way defending the memes. I feel shit like this is best done in very minute doses and they completely ODed on Memes when it came to Zeah but the backlash over something so small is like none Ive ever seen on this sub.,2007scape,cypecuu,1,t5_2wbww

6164106,0,t1_cyq8zkr,My point isnt that they shouldnt nerf it down to the intended k exphr rate. Jagex has said they will do so if they find it necessary and I agree that they should. My only point is that people are claiming souls are khr but the measurement techniques in use are overestimating the exp by khr. The nerf needed for soul runes is something in the range of  of current exp but the measuring artifacts of a single hour of OSBuddys exp tracker could indicate a nerf as large as  of current exp which would make the max xp lower than the polled value. The same thing holds true for blood runes with slightly different numbers.Jagexs response about a possible nerf focused solely on the xp rate so I didnt want to go too indepth on the AFK issue in the main post. For what its worth I agree that the mining portion of bloodssouls is unexpectedly AFK though the running aroundchiseling is roughly analogous to the runningpouch handling of other rc methods. It is by far the most AFK of major runecrafting methods the closest thing to it is double nats with tai bwo teles. Bizarrely the Jagex employees seem surprised when people bring this up with them on Twitter they point to the dark essence chiseling and altar running as evidence that these runes arent AFK though the mining part is a huge percentage of the time and very AFK.So I think Jagex meant really did mean for these runes to be high effort crafting  but then they plopped down the normal rune essence mining mechanics and ruined it. But this is more of a grey area than the exp rate where we can quantify the difference between proposed and actual exp rates and come up with the right nerf number.

Only because you pay doesnt mean you get to decide everything and it certainly doesnt give you the right to break the games balance. You claim its not overpowered yet it was proven to have the highest average spec damage in the game. That one weapon made pnecks a  absolute necessity as they dealt so much damage so often in such a short amount of time.Furthermore D claws was a level  weapon that rivaled the damage output of much more expensive level  weapons. There is a reason that people used d claws for anti crashing at bosses and rushing  instead of AGS..claws were more reliable at dealing damage.Does that not say enough for you? You claim you want to revitalize pking yet you suggest a melee weapon. You are aware that melees variety is much better than the options mages and rangers have right? Hell..mages dont even have any options at all. We can use ahrims and sotd..or we can die. So tell me how does giving melee even moar when they already have so much more compared to magerange revitalize anything?

Shitty black armor that helps you deal more damage against a specific creature that is in one area isnt broad enough to be useful. Ive made post after post suggesting alternative ideas but youll notice none of them are that specific as it keeps the items DOA content. No one is going to use shity black armor that does slightly more damage against a specific monster. No one is going to be killing a mob with a seercul so much they need a seercul. Those are too specific. If you want the armor to be used then apply something more broad. If you want seerculs to be useful fix the spec and up the stats a bit too the msb I. At this point your being oblivious calling Barrows armor useless. You can even push the items harder to make them better idfk but hyper specific uses dont make DOA content magically useful. ,2007scape,cyr3n19,1,t5_2wbww

Low risk has guards medium risk doesnt have guards but you can only attack people in your level range and high risk is how the currently unguarded areas are now. Also use guards the way Darkscape does so they patrol the area and its possible but very difficult to escape them. Darkscape all in all was a much better implementation than OSRS and if they introduced things like bank keys and losing stats on death it would likely be the best possible combination.,2007scape,cysadkf,-1,t5_2wbww

As an example a  GP margin on  of an item is M profit easily doable for a seasoned mercher. If you know what youre doing you could easily make M to even M per  hour flip. Ideally youd be able to do flips like this  times in a  hour period per character. Lets be generous and say you make say M profit a day flipping per character. X characters thats M profit only logging in a few times a day. Even on a bad day with half the profits thats M. Not bad imo.Source I started flipping with a small M bank and Im up to M within a month of flipping.,2007scape,cywibri,1,t5_2wbww

6251213,0,t1_cz06jzm,gt Heres the thing the time investment required for fight caves makes it so much more exciting when you beat it.Understandable but it can be argued that beating a difficult encounter that required a significant amount of skill which in itself doesnt equal time investment offers similar satisfaction when conquered. Said skill could be developed by the player over the course of fighting the encounter many times.gt  If I could get to Jad in  minutes itd be like we if I fail Ill try again. When I get to Jad after like  or  minutes and Im waiting for him to spawn in dead silence my heart beat goes nuts. Its calmed down a bit now that Ive done it like  times on slayer tasks but even after having done it several times it still had that effect.Makes sense but at the same time making the encounter itself more difficult in some way could elicit a similar effect. Encounter design has made some strides in OSRS so its quite possible to develop something that will destroy you a ton of times not talking about number tweaking  the ultrahigh damage telegraphed attacks are fair if perhaps a bit brutal spending a lot of time learning the encounter itself instead of on fighting a bunch of trash mobs and creating feeling of great tension as youre on the verge of winning the fight or reaching the next phase.gt The whole point is that its a test of mental endurance and skill.So is creating a difficult encounter one is gradually eased into and progresses on as mentioned above but spends loads of time trying to practice the encounter. Seriously I got to Jad on my first ever try in the Fight Caves  the first  waves might trip up inexperienced players but they arent difficult so much as timewasting busy work.gt Plus people spend s upon s of hours doing long boring tasks like training agility or smithing or whatever I just dont understand why so many people are complaining about spending an hour or  for a single attempt at getting this item. Go beg them to buff xp rates by like x and use the time you save to spend on these fight caves because the time spent on a single attempt is already so insignificant compared to training a skill.How in the world is this even comparable? While skilling in itself could use some improvement to the gameplay or the like outside of Deadman Mode theres generally not too many failure states in skilling that will erase some progress youve made or cause an extremely significant delayspeed bump in the progression which again comes down to iteration time. If anything the progression curve is usually a smooth upward one meaning every second invested equals progression that players can easily see and understand. Perhaps this is a large part of why Runescape is enjoyable to some players.gt Think of it this way anyone can go solo dagannoth kings even at a low level and get at least a few kills. On the other hand staying there for an entire slayer task requires a whole new level of skill focus and endurance to do. Same for the people who go to bandos solo and get like  kills only a few people do it that well though. Its just a whole new level of skill. Again these arent comparable. The iteration time is a lot shorter for both and its more a matter of dealing with the encounters  multiple times. The trips there are nearly inconsequential by comparison and this is coming from someone who hates Waterbirth Island with a passion. TLDR Not all time sinks are created equal. Some are sensible by design and others not so much. Also greater amounts of time spent doesnt automatically equate to difficulty.,2007scape,cz071ux,3,t5_2wbww

Lets say an ultimate iron man dies with stacks of herbs ores logs etc. A dedicated troll can drop items with a moderate value magic logs for example that would still clear out a good part of his inventory.

6298462,0,t1_cz5jsl8,Thats what niche items exist for  BiS can exist to simply push up what the best is seen as especially when locked behind what is clearly intended as highly challenging content like The Inferno. Then releasing Best in One Stat items that go over the BiS items stats is a simple way to create interesting rewards that have very specific uses. The BiS line needs to be improved over time plain and simple. It just means they have even more room to push specific stats up via more niche items.,2007scape,cz5kbgr,1,t5_2wbww

Id recommend making a FP PK account personally especially if nostalgia is a main reason for your playing it. The grind can get very AFK if you want to multitask with your ironman its a huge wave of the retrofeelies because youre stuck with rune and green dhides and the builds youd be losing for the first dozens or so fights are much MUCH cheaper to replace that almost any other PK setup. The rune hand ticktoggling mechanics and all that shit are also the main mechanic in FP PK so youll be able to work on some vital tactics for when you upgrade your account to members or make a new account.,2007scape,cz6ur19,1,t5_2wbww

6318087,0,t1_cz7rip3,Hard to say it depends on prices. Before the exp was buffed Dragon Heads were slower exp per hour than Gilded but still were a lot cheaper. I think my old math was it saved m but took an hour or two longer  if I manually used the bones which Id say is worth the time saved. The lower level heads may be slower exp and take longer but the money saved may be worth it. It depends on your magic level and means of money making really if you make a lot of money per hour it is more justified to go with the quicker but more costly route.,2007scape,cz7so2f,1,t5_2wbww

If one item is cheaper players will chisel their supply away and it will rise. If all items are the same scale rate it would likely give them all to the same price. The blowpipe may still be worth more though since it is more useful. But saying Blowpipe should give more scales because of its GE price is like saying the AGS and SGS should have x the alch value than the other godswords because their prices are higher the game doesnt base its values on players values.,2007scape,cz7yqop,1,t5_2wbww

Even if we kept the hour timer but removed barrows not degrading imbues being kept and untradeables not going on the floor it would be an improvement.It is just ridiculous how you can die and keep enough that you dont even have a reason to return. I could understand if DCs were still common but it is more that players are careless or such and die at Zulrah and not having to pay the Ahrims repair cost is removing an important gold sink and making Zulrah a lot more profitable than it should be. Same goes for other things as well.,2007scape,cz95qzc,1,t5_2wbww

Rune gauntlets   strength and  defense stats. Rune Spikes  Added onto rune boots for additional defense bonuses. Rune cannonballs  Increased accuracy from regular cannonballs and additional  damage. Lovakengj FavorAbility to sharpen hastas and spears making them untradable but providing enough of a buff for this process to be worth doing. True pvmers dont sell their gear anyways! Lovakengj FavorAbility to modify a dragon square shield into a dragon square shield R  It becomes resistant to dragonfire similar to dragonfire shield except its a lower level shield with lower bonuses and lack of strength bonus.Anyways these are just some ideas obviously more aggressive item sinks can be implements such as a minigame shop that accepts junk at a higher price than Grand Exchange. Mobilising armies was a great way of removing junk items from the economy using a reward point system to access ring imbues and other rewards.,2007scape,cz990j5,-3,t5_2wbww

The max hits only go down by  or  points for upgrading to tassys primordial etc.   to put that into perspective godswords can max at  or so and gmaul can max at . meaning in nearly  risk armor any godsword can hit  and gmaul can hit .  giving a devistating  combo while risking absolutely nothing but untradeables or ltk armor.   ,2007scape,czh6ddm,-3,t5_2wbww

6402559,0,t3_43cgv7,Fletching is fine alching is trash.What I dont understand is why you bring alching into the equation. If you want to talk about being selfsufficient then why not also consider chopping the logs picking the flax spinning the bowstring and crafting the nats too? Its  profit.Usually a better way to think is to break each task up individually. In this case fletching is a good money maker the problem is alching. Youre better off finding an item to alch that doesnt make you lose as much cash but I would suggest you do something else to train mage. There are a lot of methods that are twice as fast as alching and some of them even profit generously.,2007scape,czhemsv,1,t5_2wbww

Like I said its nothing to do with ge trading collector trading is heavily based on large stacks which is what this guy has and a rich collector could buy his stock for much more. I bought m shrimp for around gp each max in ge not always that much and a shrimp stat came out. A friend of mine owned m shrimp and bought my m and now owns  of all shrimp ingame.

I would vote no to this because range really needs some special attacks that dont suck balls.  Dark bow is our ONLY option for specials since they nerfed blowpipe justifiably i may add it was super OP with void at its dart speed  Karils is another example u need to also use ammy of the damned the normal karils effect is useless.  I would love to see hand cannon h crossbows that give some range damage increases perhaps the ability to disasemble the arma crossbow into a h crossbow would be a better alternative morigans throwing axesjavalins would be an amazing boss drop since the amunition is consumeable some sort of h javalin launcher perhaps h crossbows could instead launch rune javs instead of bolts?,2007scape,czmizyv,3,t5_2wbww

6527281,0,t1_cztjsin,The problem though is if the shard market is open it is much easier to manipulate a smallvalue items than a full significantly more expensive item. Say Elys are m. if they get split into  shards the shards themselves will be worth roughly m. The amount of people which can manipulate an m item is much higher than those which can manipulate an m item. Same thing with less expensive items such as bandos chestplate. They run for what m? each shard is then roughly k. A lot of people can manipulate k items but much less can manipulate m items. You get what Im saying? Disallowing shards to be bought closes off this opportunity for market manipulation in this sense.,2007scape,czuh1cc,1,t5_2wbww

Im unsure as to what the poland IP is we were in private messages with the OP and since asking for the polish IP he was talking about he hasnt responded.As for alternatives to using a socket loopback I attempted a design using memory mapped files and as per the documentation we experienced some unreliability between operating systems with how promptly the signal was transmitted between processes. I decided on using the socket loopback technique as it is an ageold widely supported method and we experienced no issues with it during testing.The issue with simply checking processes is that the existing process must get the chance to display deiconify and request focus of the launchers window. This would be enough if we only needed to identify that another launcher was running and exit. Gideon,2007scape,czv4ake,2,t5_2wbww

Make sure they cant be picked from the ground if they happen to find themselves there. Instead it either . stays in inv. . goes to bank. . claimable from npc as stated. This is actually very doable using the same system you have for a pin and untradbles such as god books. However itd take coding each item and wouldnt protect items such as coins or stacks really. So a ely would be protected but possibly not two elys. However the code could be changed to take up to x amount but would require different IDs for each item or a stored value of how many the player had and return those.

6545615,0,t3_44ug6y,Ive got something for you posted by Mod Kelvin head of customer support on the forums recentlygtHeygtWere currently reviewing how this went. From our side it was great to identify a small number of accounts who were hijacked and banned and we also used the data gathered to refine our hijack detection systems.gtHowever its a massively time consuming undertaking and were looking at how we can make this work better in terms of CS Specialist time versus accounts reviewed.gtIt doesnt help that the vast majority of accounts submitted were time wasters trying it on and this is part of what were trying to refine.gtI want to come up with something before Easter and yes we will advertise in advance.gtAs for hijack detection itself we have dedicated Jmods who work with our data scientists to constantly improve hijack detection and on a daily basis we review accounts hijacked and remove any offences from them  as this is all behind the scenes you wont see it.gtThe ICU team are also refining their bot heuristics to detect hijacked accounts as the  systems are entirely separate we have to take this  pronged approach.gtThe best advice is have  factor authentication on your email address get the RS authenticator and have a bank PIN dont click on any emails claiming theyre from RS unless they use your display name dont visit any cheat or gold selling sites and perform regular security scans on your computer.gtThat way youll not get hijacked in the first place and avoid the need for any account review gtKeep your eyes on the forums for more info.gtCheers!,2007scape,czwdbkh,1,t5_2wbww

6613153,0,t1_d0321hz, total level would probably demotivate people from running with membership since they would have to grind for a while to actually run the game. There would be a lot more things that would be needed to reset other than quests like diaries zeah progress miniquests. I think it would be a bit more work to implement a reset account function.Setting stats kinda seems a bit like cheating as well. We want to play the game as it was meant to be played. Setting stats would be like using action replay on a speedrun which is almost always not allowed.,2007scape,d03ctu3,1,t5_2wbww

6614689,0,t3_46aae6,I would love the old death mechanics but I feel  min is too little it will be a very difficult transition. I also dont trust that the DDoSIng will ever stop  so Im quite reluctant for the old mechanics. Also now that weve gotten new monsters that require more attention amp fast reaction time I.e. Sire Cerberus Zulrah I find that as an Australian I do die sometimes at these places just purely due to high ping. If Jagex were able to introduce Australian servers with the reversal of the death mechanics I would be less worried by the thought. Thats my two cents anyway. ,2007scape,d03ijzv,2,t5_2wbww

Thats all thanks to sticking to herb runs and doing them consistently. The biggest hassle was timing the farming ticks but got used to it eventually.

For example the Ranged Skill Cape is better than Avas in some situation and the base Max Cape is that plus additional effects so it is BiS.If the Max Fire Cape had the skillcape perks it would go from BiS to stronger BiS and replace the Fire Cape which is not what players want.

Maybe its because you dont know much about AHK?The mods have stated AHK is not a legal software but they acknowledge that some users dont have mousekeys which are legal and use AHK to mimic mousekeys capabilities. Theyve stated that they will look the other way if this is the case.AHK scripts in order to mimic mousekeys capabilities have to be  input output relative to mousekeys inputoutput. AHK has so many other capabilities that mousekeys doesnt while still being categorized as .For example a script where  is right click  moves down  pixels and  left clicks is a simple item dropping script that people can use who dont have mousekeys. That script has been around for nearly a decade and its fine to use.You can also write a script that does the same thing but using a loop. Giving each keystroke of the  button a variable so that the first time you press  it right clicks the second time it moves down the third time it left clicks and resets the keystroke variable. Everything youre doing is  input output but now youve surpassed mousekeys capabilities and that script may land you a ban.On the other hand you can write a script where you press the  button and it performs all three actions making  key drop an inventory slot. Thats not  isnt mimicking mousekeys at all and will definitely get you banned.,2007scape,d0awxry,1,t5_2wbww

As for obsidian weapons etc theres really not enough of them comming into the game to be a concern Theyre all like  drops from the tzhaar mobs and sells for K tokkul per. Assuming you could farm  mobs per hour youd still need over  hours worth of combat at minimum to get enough tokkul for ONE onyx and that is with every drop being a shield selling for K or so tokkul.

6696720,0,t3_47csb3,I would rather a decent high level shortbow. Magic shortbow Seercull darkbow rd age and crystal are all of the high level bows we have. MBS is awesome until you get to  especially in PVP. Cbows hit so high it makes  sense to use. Seercull is useless out of PVP as is DB. Even in PVP the darkbow is only okay. Its only popular because it has an okay spec which disappoints all the time btw. A is one of the most expensive items AND the highest level bow that takes arrows and it doesnt even take the highest level arrows. Not even the BIS bow either. Cry bow is great but degrades way too fast. Barrows gear degrades after  hours. Cry bows degrade entirely in under  and decrease in power every  shots until that point. Moreover the most useful piece of range gear Avas doesnt have any impact on cry bow. I could go for a level  requirement that has near the bonus of the cry bow has a spec worth using and has decent dps. Doesnt need to be BIS anything speed spec or dps but I think were missing a wellrounded weapon. IMO we have enough XBows for now. Rune Karils and Arma are all great XBows. I would much rather see them implement a Shortbow thats actually worth using for training or PVP. Right now there isnt one.,2007scape,d0bzyrj,3,t5_2wbww

Take a look at this guy This guy is my Lynx Titan my Zezima the guy I look up to when I play as being the golden build. Hes in the top  in total levels and in terms of total exp Im sure hes in the top . Im sure youll agree that its an end game account.I chose to limit myself by being  defence youre absolutely right and people voting no to the poll wont kill me. The question here is does it really matter? Is it important to deny me the opportunity simply because I chose to place some limits on myself? End game content like Venenatis just picking a random example here is available to all but only a few people are actually able to beat her and even fewer can do it efficiently and make money. To me that has always been the beauty of Runescape. Endless freedom. Youre not locked in classes or roles you do whatever suits you best. If herblores your thing then you are free to train herblore to your hearts content! If you like ranged combat but not magic then youre free to range without having a high magic level but if you change your mind thats fine too magics still there!With that in mind Im absolutely for making Monkey Madness II a feat of strength for main accounts.

6727843,0,t1_d0f783p,Untradeables are good but not for all slots. I am more against items like weapons or such being untradeable. It depends how much value a slot has. If it is something like a cape or gloves they dont have much value so adding a new one for free after a challenge is acceptable.But for weapons and armor there needs to be more of a cost. If you hand out BiS armor to rival Bandos the same as Fire Capes that would not be good. To balance it out you need to give a long grind which isnt always enjoyable. It is probably best to avoid untradeable weapons since there are a lot weapons that could be devalued and they are more impactful than other content.Now untradeable upgrades for existing weapons could work better. Then it isnt an entire new weapon but a smaller stat buff. For example something like the Kraken Tentacle but untradeable and if you died with it it separated from the item so it had risk in PvP... That works a lot better than just a brand new weapon as an untradeable.,2007scape,d0f7ujt,1,t5_2wbww

6741985,0,t1_d0gnzil,The grand exchange isnt like a store. You can only buy the item if someone else is selling it for that price. If youre trying to buy something and it wont buy immediately then keep cancelling the request and raising your offer until you get it OR you can leave whatever price it is set at and let it sit for a while and eventually it will buy. Obviously if you try and buy something for GP it most likely will not go through but if you raise the price for a cheap item to way above its market price it will most likely buy immediately.Keep in mind that depending on whats happening ingame market prices can be completely off from what an item is actually selling for but for something like a mithril axe itll almost always be consistent. The grand exchange works purely on supply and demand. That is why extremely abundant items are so cheap and items that are brand new andor rare andor useful are usually more expensive. Examples being feathers which are roughly gp each and dragon warammers which are about m.Hope this explains everything.

So a tree can grown anywhere between  and  for example. The reason that your trees will not grow during this time is because you login or logout when you trees are about to grow to there next stage. Its okay to logout if it takes like min or more before your next growth stage but just make it atleast min just to be sure to not miss any growth cycle. If you loginout there is a min timer where your trees cannot grow. So if you login or logout alot you miss alot of growth cycles.

6780630,1,t3_48ma27,Generally Im all for variety in slayer  skill but I really dont think that this is needed. Right now theres very little incentive to kill lizard shamans except for the DWH but in my opinion thats actually an extremely good thing.Its in fairly high demand seeing as its extremely useful at quite a few bosses but the supply is rather low. Keeping the price high means that you will see less random people running around with BiS all the time if you actually decide to try your luck at killing the shamans for a hammer and get one youre well rewarded its currently m and rising. Also if everyone had one then wed see more people corping and getting much higher killshr which could potentially make sigils drop slightly.So yeah seeing as lots of PvM items are currently dropping in price I think that its great to have an expensive useful item  theres no reason to crash the prices...Edit  I doubt that lizard shamans would be good slayer xph so we all know that if you want lizard shaman tasks its so that you can give yourself an excuse to go DWH hunting.,2007scape,d0kvadk,1,t5_2wbww

6780844,0,t1_d0kvl6i,Maybe not so harshly..  year is a bit stupid if you ask me.. Should be a month st then  months nd then perm rd if you continue being a twat. Im looking at it like a business though.  year is too harsh as it will reap less profits than  month  month etc. Plus you also have to consider that Runescape has always been word of mouth and if your primary form of advertisement is showing the player base as an undesirable one then its only logical to nullify that problem. The rules are loose because it gives Mods more power to act upon scenarios similar to this one. Is it an abuse? Yes but only because of the duration not because of the action. But that is my own personal opinion.Also Im not a fan of Emily but I think that people should just leave her alone. Intentionally being a dickhead to her or anyone is not nice.

6790376,1,t3_48rzpi,To quote Mod Mat Kgt The answer to AHK is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned. Although in the past you have heard people quote an  rule this is not nor has ever been true. It is a myth that many people including Jmods believed and as such was propagated as fact. It is not a fact.gt The only answer we will give is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned.gt Our approach to AHK has not changed so if you have been using it for a long time and have not been banned you are probably safe to assume what you are doing is okay. The reason we wont be more specific is those that want to cheat will push any guidelines we set out to the max and when they get banned they will complain that they thought what they were doing were in the guidelines.,2007scape,d0lz7a2,1,t5_2wbww

They seem very welldesigned to me and feel much like other old school bosses. Nieves cave removes the sense of scope from the game and keeps everything in one little convenient space which is something Im not fond of. The game has a lot of places with a lot of cool things in them its more exciting to go to a new place rather than just walk  feet in front of you and be where you need to go.All the hardened slayer masters were previously located deep in dungeons or in other mysterious out of the way or dangerous places except for the early ones. I think this fits the concept of a person who has spent an extraordinary amount of their time killing large and dangerous monsters.

There is no possible way to eat back up to  faster then they can kill me unless i shark brew karam every single hit.I agree that you should be able to die when you get hit while eating but i dont think increasing the max hit beyond hp is a good idea in the slightest and anyone with the least bit of experience would agree with thatEdit i need to stop commenting about pvp.

6895808,0,t3_4a6fbf,Ive basically been botting runescape since I started playing it. I botten back in  up until the EOC dropped.  And I have also done my fair share of botting on OSRS too.  Let me be perfectly honest and clear.  It is so much harder to bot on OSRS than it was back in the day.  Want proof?  Head over to any number of top teir botting websites and take a look at the premium script section.  Just take a quick look at the recent posts and find people who have gotten they entire farms banned after barely a day or two of botting.  The OSRS mods have cracked down on botting more than any other dev team in runescape history period.  Also Ive had every one of my OSRS account banned with probably less than a week or two of botting done on them.  Not mad about it its just not profitable to bot OSRS anymore.  ,2007scape,d0xyiec,39,t5_2wbww

6922174,0,t3_4ajj6x,I always saw it as a poor slayer themed ripoff of Castle Wars that players just afked for Exp. The Exp Rewards made it more about Exp than fun like other minigames and brought a lot of leeches. Its gameplay was never that fun for me either it just felt like a chaotic mess than anything involving tactics like Castle Wars. It also seemed to only have games of  players with lobbies of  players so it was easy to miss the queue I dont recall many worlds or games being reasonable players counts to where it was actually bearable.Now if it had the same combat requirement as Pest Control and offered same exp per hour in the same skills it wouldnt be as useful for exp or impact certain account builds as much. But at the same time I dont think it would be nearly as popular without the exp rewards since that is why most players played it. Design wise it was a mediocre minigame at best it was the rewards that made it popular.Now that being said I think OSRS could take the good elements from it mix it with some from Stealing Creation and make a really fun minigame. The map and area control elements of Soul Wars could work well with the resource gathering and random nodes of Stealing Creation and make something more enjoyable than just a slaughterfest. If it was a new minigame it wouldnt be tied to old rewards either and could even see some new useful items similar to what PC and BA offer.,2007scape,d10yaoh,2,t5_2wbww

A chinese company namely Tencent has recently acquire a majority stake of Riot Games and then bought out the remaining equity of the developer. However nothing has changed to our gameplay or transaction yet. Most likely is the company will buy out the stocks so they own the company but allow the companyJagex to continue operating as it is. From what I remember reading on the league subreddit Chinese companies have trouble operating in the western market so instead of directly doing so they simply buy a western company. In this case even if the acquisition goes through it may have no effect on our gameplay since they will allow Jagex to continue to run RS as they see fit.,2007scape,d11dbuo,3,t5_2wbww

I was offering to host for free WITH MAX QUEST POINTS which meant that anyone who had chosen to use me as a host would have only paid K total k discount from max quest points k  k  k as opposed to K via bots an k discount. I tested this with one of my friends prior to this little experiment to make sure that this was indeed the case.EDIT Although to add to what youre saying.... it is ridiculous that the update is still more expensive to use than a bot.

Its not overpowered by current standards and it filled a niche that was needed for Magic.

But they need to think about this stuff and get it right next time.  Maybe even run a Beta server where volunteers can help them find stuff thats broken.  Theres really no value to keeping the mechanics of the endgame secret.

However he was DBowing the varrock bank and that has some inevitable risk with it.Ian you complain so so deeply about clanmanmode yet you advertise a gold swapping CC you and ALL of your friends swap as much as you can and take donations then walk around like the rot equivelant just piling people and you think its okay because youre in AOAA so youre The good guy.  There was absolutely no need for the condescending tweet after a clearly massive kill.Id say the only DMM streamer I respect is Baty even more so after the late start this season.  He refuses donations he plays solo he raises the issue of clanmanmode but he has integrity and doesnt fall to their level he started late amp hes already starting to climb rapidly.Im dissapointed in Tims knee jerk reaction honestly its sorta weak that despite all of his experience he chooses to DBow people in safezones for hours but in all fairness Ian was quite condescending and massively hyopcritial.,2007scape,d1sc1id,7,t5_2wbww

7249087,0,t3_4epdlc,Youre going to want to get your magic up early on.  Id do witchs house to get some health run through the stronghold of security for k and then do Waterfall quest gives a ton of attackstrength but you mainly want the fire giants.  Mage the fire giants until  magic so that you can get around more easily and so that you can kill harder monsters when needed.  They drop rune scimitars which would be nice but is not our primary goal at the moment but if you get one before  you should probably find something else to mage.  For when you run out of runes you can either do some runecrafting not recommended or farm gold.  Good early ways of farming ironman gold are HAM storerooms need thieving levels.  You should steal some cakes in ardougne sooner or later anyway or pick up steel platebodiesearth staves in the lava maze in the wilderness.  I actually got decent drops and was able to get  magic with only one trip to the lava maze.Do some quests both for exp and for teleports.  Do the grand treetree gnome village for almost ish attack and for spirit tree teleports.  Witchs House will give you a ton of HP and merlins crystalholy grail will give you a solid defenseprayer level.  I would also prioritize doing fairy tales part I for fairy rings.  You actually unlock them from fairy tales part II but you get them at the beginning of the quest and dont need any of the skill requirements.As for skills you should start out grinding the best first is  agility IMO.  Theres just no reason not to do it first.  You can also just grind til you get full graceful and then put it on hold coming back when you need a certain higher level for a shortcut or when you just feel like it.Another skill youll probably be wanting unless you just really love crafting is  hunter.  It will take forever but the item it unlocks dragon implings drop a few cool items such as DDSD long but youre mainly it it for the glory amulet will be best in slot for you for a loooong time.  Maybe not though considering MMs amulet might be easily obtainable.  That requires  HP anyway though.  Unfortunately I dont think youll be able to use the resources for a while as you dont want to use your chins until  ranged.After that youll want to focus on grabbing some decent gear via quests andor gold grinding and then just do some slayer grinding.  Thats all Ive got.  Im on the hunter step myself at the moment but Ive watched a fair amount of ironman playthroughs so hit me up if you have questions.,2007scape,d2264fb,1,t5_2wbww

7252979,0,t3_4er5gx,On task Slayer helmet i with barrow gloves  d hide is better in most situations. It depends on what other range gear boosts you can use with void. Let me explain.. Slayer helm i  dragon hide  barrow gloves is better than Void range IF other gear  snakeskin boots normal or no archer i ring. Void Range is better if other gear  pegasian boots  archer i ringPlease note the above comparison is done based off your average slayer task monsters that have LOW rangedefense stats.

7258312,0,t1_d237bwf,Yes exactly. Thats literally the bug. It doesnt matter what HP Im at after if you used a slow weapon to deal a killing blow I can be invincible for that killing blow and then heal up for free afterwards.You seem to be confusing someone being unkillable for  minute straight with someone just defied death because they timed their eating.You dont need to be  consistently invincible for this to be a problem. So long as youre abusing it at the correct times and being invincible when its most important its a problem.Theres no counter play to it. What the hell is the point of getting  strength if my max hit against someone is still going to be  if they eat at the same time?You do not need to be abusing this  of the time. As long as someone is smart enough to abuse it when they actually have the threat of death its problematic. No it doesnt require skill either just extremely basic thought processam I probably going to die from the next hit? gt no keep dealing damagegt Yes I should abuse the invincibility bug then heal up and continue dealing damage.There is no downside to it at all.The max hit in FP is .

Theres plenty of players who would be interested in doing intermediate level quests in Zeah for example that expand the lore and provide entertainment and rewards that fit into the kind of rewards offered in quests back in  period.As far as adding better and better combat items requiring better armor to defend from them coming from higher level monsters with more hitpoints that hit so hard that  hitpoints doesnt seem like a high enough maximum anymore meaning more food needs to be added to the game that allows your max hitpoints to be higher than  and then the cycle repeats again and again until this game is basically just an alternate path to rs and we all get the feeling that everyone was talking about when the servers came out in  that with all the accumulative updates and crap added to the game something was lost and it wasnt lost at one point in time it was lost gradually.  Fuck does NO ONE know how to learn from the mistakes of the past?     Youre not even playing oldschool runescape anymore at this point.  Youre playing some kind of runescape themed abomination designed to delight ADHD  year olds with the attention span of a gnat who need constant updates and the ability to see bigger and bigger numbers as time goes on.  Its never enough for these people theres no logical conclusion power creep must continue forever.  Its like the person who no matter how wealthy they get theyre never satisfied they always want more.  You cant try to indulge them with new BIS it will never be enough.  Its even worse in the live game now because so many s have been devalued they have a new effective cap of  for levels.  At the moment this is cosmetic but I can see the way the wind is blowing... Jagex wait until were comfortable with a new change before they start relaxing its scope and making it more powerful just like they did with pets they started with a small number and then kept adding to the list as people got used to them.

Teleports ports with charter ships fairy rings and gnome gliders are great!Also a great addition to a new design would be to add Great Kourend Achievement diary.

I never talked about people being scammed. The death timers have not been forgotten about and the mods do talk about it on occasion one example  there are probably others that are more recent and others that are older. They were temporary solution to a problem that was expected to be based on the past temporary. They cannot remove the solution until the problem is fixed they are looking for when they can revert the mechanic and even if they do it looks like something RSish will be polled anyway and based on community like for the longer timers probably pass. Im sorry dude but the game you grew up with is gone mechanics change peoples play styles change it happens.

7454770,0,t3_4hc6yx,I still have yet to find the actual stream where this happened but from what I can gather there were a bunch of people dressed up in Klan outfits spamming racial slurs or otherwise making racist jokes. As far as Im concerned if that isnt racist then nothing is. However I think its worth it to spend a little bit of time discussing what exactly the term racist means.Most people would probably define racism as a hierarchy of races especially one that is enforced by means of violence and especially the hierarchy that emerged in the wake of the European colonization of most of the inhabited world. Particularly memorable in the global history of racism is the centurieslong enslavement of black people in North America and other parts of the world. With this definition it is extraordinarily difficult to argue that what these people did was not racist. The action was obviously intended to recall one of the more violent moments in the history of racism and is therefore racist in that sense of the word. However I think OP is using the word racist to mean something more along the lines of harboring hatred toward a particular ethnic group. As far as I can tell if he and many others believe the people were simply kidding theres no reason to call them racist in this sense of the word.While there are surely plenty of black people who do not take offense at jokes about the KKK I think its fairly safe to assume that the wide majority do and with good reason. Most people do not particularly like being reminded how their ancestors were lynched by racist mobs. Sometimes it can be therapeutic or comforting or otherwise enjoyable to make jokes about horrible things. Some people just have a dark and fatalistic sense of humor and they like that kind of thing. Other times when you know the other person shares your struggles or at least acknowledges and understands them a joke can be a way of dealing with the absurdities of life and creating a social bond. Hey yeah things are shit but we can still laugh at how ridiculous life is. But I think for most people who have some notion that things can get better and that racism can ultimately become a thing of the past it isnt funny when a random group of trolls on the internet decides to make an extraordinarily immature joke about an ugly horrible thing. They dont care about anyones suffering they just want to piss people off. Racism is just a joke to them nothing more.I suppose the best thing anyone can do is not feed them. Understandably people have emotional reactions to this sort of thing but at the end of the day theyre just a bunch of losers on the internet. Theyre not worth anyones insults or hatred or anger nor will that help anything. I hope one day the people who do this kind of thing can find the love and the selfesteem and the happiness that they are most surely missing in life.TLDR Dressing up in Klan outfits and using racial slurs is definitely racist if thats what happened but I think OP is trying to say that these people dont have racial hatred because its just a joke to them. I think its safe to say most people take offense to this and with good reason. Just because its a joke doesnt mean its not racist. At the end of the day people should try not to get too worked up about it because thats what the trolls want. I hope one day the trolls can find meaning in life because I think its safe to say they are pretty damned unhappy or at least very numb to the world.,2007scape,d2pk67a,0,t5_2wbww

You could go in an easy game with relatively weak hitting bosses and use splitbark with an occult and smokestaff and just use fires strike for like k xph or so. I train mage this way on my alt but with fire bolt with chaos gauntlets and that gets me k xph. Fire wave is a pricier option but gives decent xp its about kh.

Even though Reach designed the robes years ago his design looked drastically different and more old school than the model Ghost created. I like variety to scenery but this variety has to fit into the current OSRS graphics. Look at the Hell Hound Boss room. It looks amazing and its all new content was created by Alfie in an OSRS style. Then look at the room for the Abyssal Sire it still looks ok but its starting to look more RS like. Completely different to Alfies and OSRSs style.,2007scape,d2uln4p,0,t5_2wbww

Its simply for fun and trying to make it efficient isnt going to happen.In fact I love seeing people complain about not being able to obtain these. It just shows that you have no patience and are more concerned with xp rates and time over being laid back and having fun.Castle Wars always had people fixing games sometimes Id lose  straight and get no tickets. Sometimes Id win  straight.The point is now you can win at least  ticket per game.  tickets in an hour at minimum.If you put the time in and just have fun youll get a halo no problem.

They probably bring in . of the money that alching in total does.The Karamja general store brought in probably less than  of the money that alching did.

7580521,0,t1_d33s427,If the target has decent defence thats all accuracy affects  Your ability to not his s.Ranged Strength allows you to generally hit higher. So if you were to train on ogres a creature with a very low defence level you would prioritise ranged Strength over accuracy. Where as if you were to attack a creature with high defence for example a dragon you would want to prioritise accurate attacks Hence why people use Crossbows on Dragons instead of throwing knives. So yes lowering accuracy lowers DPS by some amount but by how much depends on the level and ranged defence of your opponent.,2007scape,d33v9rr,4,t5_2wbww

7582157,0,t1_d341jox,Let me address your last point first. I think the MTX transactions are virtually irrelevant because do you really think the players who are lining Jagexs pockets with Rs micros give a fuck about lore? I would confidently gamble the vast majority do not. OSRS has half or more than half of the playerbase more people that care about lore probably. Anyway to your other points...I dont think that the lore is even relevant if that is your argument. What is the spinoff game going to be? Like a MOBAtype game such as LoLDotaSmite etc? Thats what I would gamble on. Also Blizzard isnt dead I dont think...they merged with Activision years ago and they control Hearthstone I believe which is popular. I could be wrong but Im pretty sure about this. I just dont think any RSJagex spinoff is going to rely on lore at all and could easily just create their on cannon lore. If its goal is to attract other players who dont care about RS lore anyway then why is this even relevant?  ,2007scape,d341yia,1,t5_2wbww

For example people being able to double name change and scammers getting away because of this.The only fair argument Ive seen is that since there will be a new option for OSRS bonds the demand will be higher making the price of OSRS bonds increase but in my opinion this argument fails also.

7600017,0,t3_4jex9a,A great suggestion a few months back that got a lot of support was an ability to make items untradeable for a cashprice. To elaborateSay youve got a M dragon warhammer. You dont want to lose it if you get hacked so you insure it for  of the GE price so .M. The item is now untradeable cant br brought to the wildy staked etc like the old lend item functionality essentially  useable everywhere except places where it could be lost and not yours to tradegive away cant be dropped. Making the item tradeable again would require a day wait period just like removing a bank pin. This would have multiple benefitsA huge gold sink. A player with all expensive pieces of equipment would need another  to insure hisher bank because of the fee half of that being the elysian though. Peace of mind for people that get hacked  especially IronMen who cant easily get items back by buying them. Help stakers avoid staking their banks away if they want to try and keep items  if you cant chug your slayer gear because its insured you arent likely to wait  days to go chug it. Itd also have obvious downsidesYour wealth is tied up for much longer so you need to decide if you can afford to insure an item.Cant lend stuff to your friend. Idiots will see it as a replacement for bank pins instead of an addition and only use one of the two.,2007scape,d3630xm,5,t5_2wbww

Facts do not require proof they only need to be true.Edit Fact a thing that is known or proved to be true. I have no issues with the English language you have gaps in your logic.

The important things you did was announce that most bans were  days bans labeled as bug abuse to fit the necessary time frame and that they were involved in an organized group of harassment. Releasing the chat log was a necessary thing to do because the only way to stop an angered community is to give them something they cant argue against. It may have been a little late but today I think this issue has been handled well and we should all learn a little lesson about not listening to people who live on Reddit just to start drama and get up votes you got my respect back Mat K. ,2007scape,d3a5d2f,1,t5_2wbww

7682677,0,t1_d3faqrs,I agree that risk vs reward has always been a fundamental aspect of RuneScape. Deadman and DarkScape injected an extreme amount of this riskreward gameplay into the game. Where they failed was that by adding too much of this uncertainty hardcore pvp gamemodes broke the linear and certain progression that is also a fundamental aspect of the game. You train a skill you gain exp you level up. You kill a monster you get a drop you gain wealth. Runescape players dont like it when their progression is hindered or set back by something out of their control. It is something which conflicts with a core concept of the game. This is why adding skilling plots to the wilderness is so problematic in the grand scheme of the game. They have to be risky enough to attract pkers but they have to be rewarding enough to entice skillers. The only way to get this balance is to force skillers into the wilderness by adding higher level resources that are exclusive to those wilderness skilling spots. If these skilling spots were not way better than current methods they would be dead content on release. Your suggestion would not work in the game because it would be too difficult to balance. Power creep is a whole other issue. Players dont like unchecked power creep.Another wilderness quest would be good I like this part of your suggestion but another new area full of new stuff that would ruindevalue other pieces of content is not necessary. The wilderness is full of fortresses abandoned encampments and ruined cities why not add some more story to existing landmarks.  ,2007scape,d3fh1xn,1,t5_2wbww

7688827,0,t1_d3febaz,Ill try to explain it in a simpler way. Lets just assume you have b cash but because you are still a cheapskate you bet m. You lose double up to m lose again double to m etc etc and lets say you have the cash to do this up to  stakes doubling up  times so in the final stake you win m after losing m total thus making a m profit. The chances of you losing this many stakes just so conveniently happens to be    .This means there is a  chance of you winning m and a  chance of you losing . Now lets assume we live in a mathematically perfect universe then in every  stakingstreaks youd break even exactly. So OP is correct in infinite attempts the average profitloss should be . All profitloss in a  scenario is decided by luck,2007scape,d3g65r9,1,t5_2wbww

However they should not be allowed to have his YOUTUBE account banned for whatever actions he does on a different platform unless all other RS content creators are doing similar? So whether hes scamming cheating or doing literally ANYTHING RuneScape related isnt the point.

7747882,0,t3_4lfi70,From my experience its important to maximise your prayer bonus so consider paying a bit extra for gear like a fury over glory. Other than that the greatest determining factor to whether you will get your cape or not is your mechanics once you get into the fight caves making mistakes and taking damage you shouldnt on the waves and eventually correct pray switching against Jad.Other than watching some guides and maybe mimicking the pray switching to prepare the best way to learn is to get into the fight caves and try it!!I remember on my nd attempt on osrs I brought mage pots instead of range and realised around wave  but decided to just go through with it because at the end of the day your gear doesnt matter so much as your mechanics and minimising the mistakes you make especially on Jad when your heart is racing.

7755638,0,t1_d3nqmnr,gt Absolutely not the goal of the original. By having stats be the same the only random element is item loots. The idea is that someone more skillful can overcome a gear difference. Its much more difficult for someone to overcome both gear and stat difference.There is also skill in picking your level builds. And bud. Did you read what I said?I said this was NOT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL BUT A CUSTOM GAME MODE THAT WOULD BE A NEW PART. I NEVER FUCKING SAID IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL. Jesus christ read what I said before you respond.gtThere is no skill in picking a build and hoping you get those items. If you pick a build and get nothing usable you are completely fucked because you are already locked into those stats.There is skill. You get to decide and plan for what builds you think will be the most useful versus what builds you are likely to encounter and what would be useful around that. Just because you cant see how something would require skill to be good at doesnt mean it doesnt require skill. I am the one designing this suggestion and I can safely say it definitely requires skill.gtNot at all. When everyone has the same stats there is much less of a gap between people.Yes and I am not suggesting we do away with this. What I suggested was a custom additional gamemode to the new gamemode as a side suggestion for those interested in more planning required play. gtWhich means you have to pick a specific build to go for. This is the exact reason of why yolo strats would be so powerful and frankly necessary.Yolo strats are necessary for every version of this gamemode. Stop acting like they would only be needed in custom. Yes you need to pick a specific build to go for that is the fucking point of the custom game mode. gtSo this is the important thing to understand. There needs to be a balance it cant go super far either way. If you add in gear RNG and stat RNG ontop of that thats so far down the RNG path that it will be incredibly difficult for a more skillful player to succeed. There is no reason to make RNG this powerful.What the hell is stat RNG? There is no stat RNG. The only thing that is RNG is your gear. Everything else you have to plan for. You place your levels where you want them and then you go for it making do with the stats you have. gtIt also antisynergizes with the base concept of looting random items. With everyone at maxed offensive stats all items are usable so you can actually demonstrate skill in all forms and styles of combat. If you are locked into a specific build then you dont need to adapt or change your strategy at all because you have no choice and only have one playstyle.But that is so two dimensional you clearly have no idea what Im actually suggesting. The way to win this game would require bridding. People with only one skill trained high will be limited. A mage can freeze them and boom they will die. Therefore you need to have multiple playstyles to adapt and multiple strategies to take into account enemy playstyles. You arent locked into ANY specific build. You CHOOSE what build to make each round. You test different playstyles versus people testing different playstyles and you are all on an even ground for that. The only difference being how you distribute your stats. ,2007scape,d3nrah8,1,t5_2wbww

Do all the quests you can to prevent yourself from training at a low level.  If you need a requirement for a quest theres likely another quest you can do to get the exp for the first quest. Notable quests Waterfall quest knights sword grand treetree gnome village Talk to all achievement diary people as soon as you enter that area if possible. Throughout the course of your play youll be doing tasks inadvertently so this will save time in the future.

Dont get stuck doing low level money making or resource gathering thinking youre saving a lot of money.  Were efficiencyscape. If youre spending more time to save some money rather than just spending and making it all back using a good money making technique then youre wasting your time.  Do the varrock museum basement miniquest to get k slayerhunter right away boosting you to level  in both skills. If you can start farming right away to be able to farm ranarrs for nearly effortless money.  A quick cheap way to get early farming exp is to do supercompost via watermelons buy off ge.

Agility is a very worthwhile skill to level up early on as it will help you in every single thing you do. It helps speed up replenishing run energy On another note the items and armour you wear do affect how fast your run energy go down.

It takes skill to actually click the spell without misclicking and fast enough before your target runs away. SoTD can autocast because of the high cost associated with it. VKM can autocast because it takes a while to get it but it also has a defence requirement which lowers the amount of pures that use it.TLDR Give higher stats for all staves but add a high cost or min  def requirement for autocast ability.,2007scape,d3pmb2l,-1,t5_2wbww

People Currently Use heal other tactic  stat spy to ensure people have  prayer before letting them die.This is the tactic that is used commonly right now and the ability to drink potions wont really effect it is what i am trying to say.  All adding the ability to drink potions will change is the time it takes to smite the person. As its not in the game right now i cannot test it exactly but i dont need to test it to know how it will happen.  As for the snowy knights I dont need to test using them in this method either because i know how they work already and can just apply that to the method. ,2007scape,d3uk4vg,1,t5_2wbww

7817853,1,t1_d3uqm4l,Perhaps but then why did they release it with those rates? Jagex always does this. I remember in RS darklight upgrade was the best reward from a new quest. People loved it a few were mad it was OP and arguably it was OP. But people loved it and only a few were complaining. They said they werent going to change it without gathering feedback from players. But they changed it secretly i.e. they nerfed it to the point it was dead content. People got raged because it was secretly nerfed and they said they werent going to change it without player feedback. Now I know the redwood is a little different story but they said they werent going to change it based on Autums tears. Yet they seem to change stuff without asking all the players either via survey or poll. My point is if it was OP from the beginning why release it OP. Release it how they wanted they could have easily tested the rates it isnt that hard to get somebody to woodcut for one hour. See if it is a creep or leap.,2007scape,d3usi36,2,t5_2wbww

If you frequently changed IPs or used VPNs when you were playing they wont be able to say for sure that you were hijacked and you will stay banned. If you gave awaysold your account and the person who next had it played legitimately for a while and then botted you wont get the account back this seems likely to me as they changed the display name.Regardless there is nothing you can do.

If you want more kills per hour use ranged unless your magic level is  higher than your ranged level assuming your gear for both methods is similar. To be efficient use ranged since they have less ranged defense and its significantly cheaper.However If you want profitable magic exp I suggest you complete the quest Family Crest to get chaos gauntlets and autocast fire boltwill be similar max hit to fire blast with a mystic smoke staff occult.,2007scape,d3zygkx,1,t5_2wbww

This is a tidy profit for only a few seconds worth of work per day and the elite diary reward  staves will entirely pay for a bond if you collect every day.

If they went onto iOS even with the  approval time hrs that means they have to push a bad update or hold it back for a week since they will not want to release on the weekend.

7946050,0,t1_d48yrlf,Heres a small summary of the most clearcut arguments. I.e. YesNo. Im not British so it doesnt impact me much how you vote so Ive tried to make an as unbiased questionnaire as possible While the EU has formed an immigration policy more so if within Schengen Area which the UK is not. The level and scope of enforcement is still up to individual countries. The UK has historically accepted a significantly higher immigration ratio and asylum seekers approved than what it legally has to. On the other hand EU workers in UK are for the most part net contributors as the UK attracts a higher rate of highly skilled EU labor than other EU countries. Here in Finland we have had a very minor immigrationratio in general versus what the UK does. So you can still regulate immigration while still being in EU. This would point to the real problem actually stemming from UK politics. So the questions is Will Brexit actually make a difference to types of immigration that has proven problematic?Yes Brexit. NoNot sure Remain. Financial markets are predicting harsher times if the UK were to Brexit. Most evident the GBP is down from . to . against the Euro since December already. Its safe to assume it will further down if you vote leave. A persisting lower valued  mights spur investment but for the regular Nigel it means more expensive foreign products. This is more or less a fact already that will happen of some magnitude. Is your reason to Brexit worth more than this?Yes Brexit. NoNot Sure Remain. EU has a lot of good things. Do you trust your government with consumer rights for example? The EU is leader in consumer rights in the world e.g.  year warranty on all electronics throughout EU versus  year for the same product in the US. The EU also has given us an additional step to appeal to if we believe something is rules unjustly against us.Yes Brexit. NoNot sure Remain. The EU is the biggest economical block in the world. Theres no way a .Tn economy can negotiate as good terms as one that is Tn. That doesnt mean the UK couldnt negotiate good terms but it will be a step down. Do you believe the UK will be a relevant enough economy to negotiate on its own Today? In the future? If Scotland leaves?Yes all  Brexit. NoNot sure Remain. The EU budget. The UK has to contribute to the EU budget. In return you have access to the single market. Roughly  of UK exports is EU exports. This makes the EU the biggest trading partner. If UK chooses to Brexit UK will not remain in the single market. This means it would have to renegotiate terms it loses which will obviously cost money as well. Is bn too much to pay for roughly .Tn in exports yearly? Are you sure a cut in exports short term still makes it worth it to Brexit?Yes twice Brexit. NoNot sure Remain.  The regular Nigel will probably lose the easiness of moving abroad if he so wished since a Brexit now also means a definitive exit from EEA. Moving abroad would happen only if you can prove funds you are in a skilled profession or you manage to get into Uni abroad. Is Brexit worth surrendering this right?Yes Brexit. NoNot sure Remain.I may not care directly how you end up voting but I hope you realize this is one of the most important election of your life so definitely vote.,2007scape,d497l62,6,t5_2wbww

7965758,0,t3_4oc9vc,gt You need teleblock to solo pk. If you dont have it you cant pk JAGEX WHAT??? The reason DMM fails is because of clanman mode.. And you increase the need for a clan.. Really?!You dont you just need to be able to keep the other player in combat the introduction of the PJ timer will make this even easier.Again there is nothing stopping you from starting a clan it a way more fun way of playing deadman even if its only  of you in a voice chat.gt Seasons are only  months long. People dont want to play for just  months that is why everyone quits after  week.  month season  times a year is PERFECT.?? What? The game mode dies not because it is only three months but because the gap between casual players and the hardcore NEETs increases everyday. Its amplified by the five times experience.Say you log  hours a day and another player manages  hours that is a gap of  hours. Amplify this by  times and you get an effective gap of  hours every day. By only day  you have a  difference in time invested. Given that one of the two players has barrage and the other is only  range this is leads to one player quitting.gt quests nobody wants to do that Just give everybody  quest points. Then everyone will play.Ive seen this argued before here quests are not that time consuming and place rewards behind a useful wall. Ice burst would be in the game by hour four.  I imagine it would be interesting for a week but not for a few months. It also decimates any quest related escape making the only real way to escape a pker is the use of a safe zone.I think the real is the what Ive highlighted above which is the gap between casual and hardcore players. A balance has to be struck where the game can be played for one hour or ten hours and not reward the ten hour player significantly more.The proposed changes do nothing to combat this and I expect player numbers to drop exponentially again.Sorry for being pessimistic but I dont think Jagex is taking and implementing feedback from DMM to make it a viable game mode.The second LMS has been suggested all interest has been kicked out of DMM. Having five minutes in total at the summer livestream says it all.,2007scape,d4bfdha,1,t5_2wbww

I want multiplayer fun like stealing creation and soul wars. Not this bullshit no xp waste grind fest that everyone does now.Stop fucking calling everything OP you pieces of shit and actually add content to the game. I dont want to sit in the same fucking bandos and godswords for the next  years only getting niche weapons like an arclight because players are too fucking lame to add content.Im  I deserve to have curses dragon claws korasi etc.Youll see max players are going to get bored without max content and osrs is going to slowly die.So stop being bitches and add high level content.Fucking assholes.,2007scape,d4ec7re,-10,t5_2wbww

8030726,0,t3_4p7sp3,Well this was already announced a while back but kinda forgetting since. Personally I am interested to see how it will go. It will make deaths in the higher levels a lot more frustrating I am sure but I do think it is an improvement. Perhaps another idea they can explore in future seasons is making it hard to get the level the first time but quicker to get it back that way it can slow down how quick players reach the higher levels and endgame content while making it easier to get back to that point. Like if it was x around  magic and you lost  levels but had even x to get it back that would be a bit more motivating.,2007scape,d4iq9eg,2,t5_2wbww

8085154,0,t3_4pyrjs,Not bad in concept but I dont see it working out. Deadman already has a bit of a longevity problems so trying to split solo players and clans would likely not help with that and would just make each a worse experience than the combined. Clans and solo players are both a part of PvP so there shouldnt be a reason to split the two for Deadman. As for future tournaments there are changes they can make to improve it for both clans and solo players. Given the new mechanics of Season  like the PJ Timer I have a feeling that it may end in single combat next time but perhaps with a players remaining counter so clans know how many are left.,2007scape,d4oufsd,1,t5_2wbww

The  items lost on death is a great start and should stay that way but I feel as if losing even  of my unprotected xp is still way too much but possibly losing  for wanting to play the game for what its supposed to be a pk mode is just absurd and should be significantly reduced even with the combat level formula.TLDR Lock high level content by by ever couple weekweek reduce xp lost on death.,2007scape,d4x233q,1,t5_2wbww

I dont believe there should be level caps it would be a bit rediculous and defeats the grind to be the bestLevel caps would be a bad idea in my opinion.Content caps would not be a bad idea unlocking certain content as the game progresses might help quite a bit considering if you didnt have ancients by day  you were simply outclassed and also had no chance of doing the quest now because its camped with pkersDmm is a great time and a lot of fun hopefully we can all figure out a few ways to make it a better time for everyone considering a lot of people drop out after a few days maybe shorter seasons would also help considering the first week is usually the funnest.

Use a max hit calculator to figure out what your max hit will be based on the gear and consumables potsprayer you will be using to train.If memory serves me right you get a  to your max hit at either  or  then not again until  or  levels after that.

Mining and smithing are two that I would wait until members unless you powermine iron. Runecraftingget  in FP then wait for PP to continue with cosmic runes.All of this will save you a lot of time as PP as you can focus on questing without training FP skills. That is if you dont use PP quests to get xp. Its been a while since Ive done all the quests so I couldnt tell you the best level to start questing if you decide to take that route.

8261949,0,t1_d59yruv,gtno edge bridyes lets just completely ignore any other type of brid location or brid type. People use this all the time at west drags dmm chins and kinda graves just not as often. It creates a significant skill gap in DMM thats for sure. Most experienced players know how to avoid it but there are some really complex setups to get people into them. Just teleport into varrock center theres usually some guy using this technique with the tent since theres  setups in that area nd there relatively easy to trap people with. Its actually pretty satisfying to do.The reason people dont use it in edgeville is because it defeats the purpose of edgeville. Youre right next to the safety you can tele anytime you want and the most obvious reason is if you get your opponent caught like this theyre just going to eat to hp. Though most people eat to  anyway when both frozen apart.And like you said people in edge will just unhug which works around the bug fine.

8265078,0,t3_4sgd73, It was mentioned a while ago that allowing the Trident to be used for PvP can be repolled but was never mentioned again. with a reduced casting speed Can this be done? It would be important for it to be limited to the regular trident. Swamp tridents dps would be too similar to SoTD. If that presents technical issues perhaps a separate upgrade component could be made which converts the trident into a PvP version. This would completely solve the magic skills  issue of no PvP weapon variety. We  could then choose between Tridentvenge for lower dps higher KO potential or SoTD for higher dps and higher accuracy. EDIT The Elder Wand will be utterly useless at addressing this issue so yep  something is certainly still needed. ,2007scape,d5aoxmu,2,t5_2wbww

And as I answered in the other reply you can AFK Stealing Creation the same as willow trees. Players set up FC for skill only worlds to boost it where games last  minutes and you rack up a ton of points by afk skilling some things. And that is why it is bad you shouldnt have laid back and semiafk way to effectively train skills like construction because the skills themselves are not afk... That along with halving the cost and hurting the demand of the resources is what makes it bad.

I guess when it comes to almost any video I really only watch if theres a clean cut goal of that video. For instance if you would have started bossing immediately after buying your serpentine I probably would have continued watching.tldrYour video jumps around too much in such a short little of time that its confusing and I ask myself Why am I watching this?Hope this helps.p.s.

I would recommend watching this video to see the blowpipe method in actionTheres also the fight with the demonictortured gorillas just before you fight Glouph. Your stats are plenty high to take those out just focus on one at a time and try to stay calm when focusing prayers. You can leave the area after you kill the gorillas and they wont respawn so dont worry about trying to save supplies.Then there is Kruk who you can easily flinch on a corner of his cave. Youll be able to kill him rather quickly.Good luck on the quest if you have any questions let me know ,2007scape,d5krib0,3,t5_2wbww

They could make prayers that improve skilling benefits but thatd mean rates would go up and people already dislike that  not to mention itd just become a formality of wearing max prayer boosting gear have a tele to where youre training and a desert ammy and just keep recharging. The only other thing I can think of that could maybe be useful in a combat environment that wouldnt be OP against bossesPvP would be a cleaving prayer that can only be used with no other prayer active  for example cleave all mobs in a x square around target for  of dmg done but no piety or protect from melee allowed so hits are generally smaller and you will be taking dmg from multiple mobs. Could work fairly decently with the catacombs providing multicombat environments for a ton of mobs for slightly better exp rates that still probably wouldnt rival using a cannon.,2007scape,d5o7mu8,1,t5_2wbww

I buy the bonds on my main and just trade them over to my bot accounts and every day trade the saltpetre to another account. Ive got  accounts one has been running  hours a day for the past month and the other two rotate every  hours.

I dont sell the gold and goldfarm to supply my pures and main which is wIts only been in the past  weeks that the amount of people botting saltpetre has grown. Because of it the price has the high s to sub . The amount of saltpetre per hour at level  is about  since the popular scripts like to world hop if the saltpetre isnt in one of the three closest locations.

Things like that would be great to get.They decided against the  tier weapons and armour from raids and it was subsequently never polled. Its exactly because it would become new BiS in almost every way.

8442312,0,t3_4v0l4m,I feel like you should be rewarded for how well you performed in a game. For example  kill is  points and you can spend the points in a nmz type shop. If you win you get an extra  points perhaps. If time runs out you receive  points to encourage people to attack others at the end of the game. I think you get k if time runs out not sure.,2007scape,d5wttaq,1,t5_2wbww

8449323,0,t1_d5xp424,Yes but that would be a horrible system. There is often times routers lag packets to preserve QoS and your timing may look even  causing a false ban. And even then doing Sleepmath.random is possible and will bypass static timings. Yes it is easy for yourself to see someome clicking at the same interval But when you scale the operation up to  players at once it will be a little more errorprone if you do that. I am not saying AHK is detectable Im fully aware I can be banned.

8471540,0,t3_4vptl5,With  Mage you could start learning Zulrah since you can use a trident. You could kill Callisto since most of the damage he does is through his unblock able special attack and you basically only hit when the veracs set effect goes off. All of the Wildy Demi bosses are possible though I would get  Mage to use a trident to kill Scorpia. KBD would be easy with your range level but Brutal Black dragons are realistically better gphr without the risk.With  def you could solo Sara fairly effectively. You could try now but you wouldnt get many killstrip. A range level or two wouldnt hurt either. You could kill KQ but it would be one kill a trip most of the time even on task. I would wait until you have  in all melee and range to farm it though. With  Mage you could easily solo Rex. You could now but trident makes it way more cost effective.Barrows is definitely doable but if you guessed that  Mage and a trident would make it easier youd be correct. You can easily kill the mole but do the falador hard diary first so that the drops are noted and you have a mole locater. That makes it more profitable and less anger inducing. To really get into the high tiers of solo bossing aim for flat s in melee  range and  magic. The last one is mostly for Zulrah but every level increases you magic defense and trident dps slightly. Eventually you want  Mage though venge isnt necessary just useful. On to things to aim for all soloIm not including the stats for prayer flicking methodsFor Venenatis Venge really speeds up solo kills but you dont need it for duos. You could do vetion with a lure at  attstr or maybe lower since you safe spot it but it can be frustrating at times.For ZammyBandos GWD I would aim for flat s melee and  magic to solo. Its possible at flat s but you wont get more than one kill without a lot of luck. For Armdyl GWD I would get at least  def and  range though preferably  def. if youre not aware of the Chinning method Google Armadyl GWD Chinning method when you decide to do solo arma. I use a c bow in my first trip in case I accidentally died though.For Sara GWD  def range is fine though higher range always helps. Check out the Sara GWD Chinning method though I learned with a c bow in case I accidentally died. For DKs flat s all around rangeMage included is okay for tribridding all three but you will want to use the guthans method andor kill Rex twice per rotation.I may have left some bosses out but thats all Ive got for solo off the top of my head. The options open up if you duotrio bosses. ,2007scape,d60hedc,9,t5_2wbww

8494673,0,t3_4voxv0,Gems are my favorite part of runescape... I swear you are my long lost friend ltIn all seriousness this seems like a fun idea! Although it may be a slight pain for ironmen to gather that many dragonstones. Perhaps you can add charges to the staff based on the cut gems alchemy price rather than a set number of stones to charge it. For example a cut opal would give  charges gp alch price and a cut dragonstone would give it  charges gp alch price.I really like most of the spell though. I think having a minimum damage cap for an offensive spell would be very unique for PvM!,2007scape,d63duk1,1,t5_2wbww

Quite possibly you didnt even read through my comment.This is MY original idea as of now and not a suggested change to your badly thought idea.A new spellbook only for gettng around. Has every important teleport including minigame and some jewlerey teleports.NO sort of rune stuffing into one item isnt overly overpowered as you are giving up a spellbook this means you do not have any offensive spells teleport blocks or freezes. Its not an item that you can turn into FIVE THOUSAND LAW RUNES Did you even think that bit through properly. Unlocking a new spellbook through raids makes no sense. Unlocking it through a quest does and were talking about an untradeable account feature or we u wanna call it so even a miniquest is fine.Miniquest short idea You bring together the wisest of wizards from The Wizards Tower Arceuus Tower Lunar Isle amp Im not too familiar with the lore behind Ancient Magicks but...

In fact up until about  years ago it was socially desirable in the western world for girls in their developing teen years to secure established successful men in their communities. In fact its still commonplace in the nonwest today. Its kind of incredible how backwards america is when it comes to sex. The only countries in the world with higher consent ages are Islamic republics. Were so obsessed with defining whether or not a person is ready to have sex by a magical number. Ive met girls well into their twenties who werent ready and in contrast Ive been pressured by girls under  to have sex when I was in high school. We have a society so morally confused that people randomly throw accusations of paedophilia toward anything that doesnt fit their narrative yet we turn around  and watch the sitcom where the married couple spices up their failing sex life by dressing the wife up as a little school girl. ,2007scape,d6jvrk7,-8,t5_2wbww

Youd find a damaged looking wizard and upon asking him what happened he tells the story of an accident he  had while researching teleportation in which he accidentally created a dangerous cloud that backfired. Youd ask if it has any combat potential. If the player has a certain mage lvl the wizard would say something along the lines of you look like an experienced mage perhaps you could find a way to make use out of my mistake and teach it to you. ,2007scape,d6nilbq,2,t5_2wbww

I wont deny that. But to be fair Rune to Nezzy isnt exactly that far apart. What i mean is Nezzy is a free item you get from completing a quest that really isnt all that difficult. This new armor will pretty much never be used for PVP because of the fact a single piece will cost most players entire bank. And thats not even factoring in that repair cost. But hey in the end its clear the two of us share different views on where the game should go moving forward.

8793211,1,t3_50i54b,A lot of people are bringing up the fact that the shop brings extra gold into the game but are failing to address the actual problem with it. Mod Kierens refutation to this incomplete argument is that something like battle staves bring far more gold into the game than the stores  extra gold perk what hes saying is true but it does not address the actual problem associated with the shop. The fundamental problem with the shop isnt that it allows too much gold to enter the game but more so that it allows gold to enter the game too fast. Take alching rune plate bodies for example when alching regardless of how many rune plates you have k will be injected into the economy every  seconds. In this hypothetical case .m will come into the game per hour. The problem with the Karmaja store is that you are able to sell for example  d hide bodies  rune plates  battle staves etc in the span of  seconds  seconds is a GENEROUS figure considering AHK. Where simply alching these alchables will result in X number of gp selling them will result in the same amount of gp in a MUCH shorter span of time leading to inflation and the such. It is important to remember that if it were not for this shop these alchables would sit in someones bank for a while before actually having a palpable impact on the economy and no they would not drop below alch value because they would act as potential gp. This shop would be a problem regardless of any bonus  percentage of gp attained by selling because the real impact derives from how fast they are being sold. The General Store buying items at lowalch value is a prime example of taking the precautions necessary to ensure this quick gold generation doesnt happen. I seriously hope this shop is just done away with at some point. TLDR  The problem with the shop is that it generates gold too fast not that it generates gold in sheer principle. ,2007scape,d74tpgi,0,t5_2wbww

8806593,0,t3_50rj2h,Use the best melee damage setup you have maybe something like dragon scimitar and dragon defender. Then just use some basic armor like rune or dragon armor. Theres no need for barrows armor unless you have dharoks or guthans set. Have you ever used NMZ before? Overloads are pretty key and keeping hp with absorption potions is extremely useful for prolonging your time in NMZ. Here is a great tutorial if you havent done NMZ before.You want to always use the hp overload  absorption setup because it is super cheap compared to using prayer pots. Just try a few endurance challenges with some food until you get something like k points. Then use those to buy potions  overload  absorption. Once you have a good stockpile of potions you can  do trips to NMZ for k points at a time.Also a small tip. If you have a slayer helm try to get a task for a monster you will fight in NMZ Black demons hellhounds etc. This can help you get a little more damage per second.I think I averaged something like k points per hour with a dragon scimitar and a dragon defender with  melee stats. ,2007scape,d76flm3,5,t5_2wbww

It was always planned to be more than just Great Kourend and Mod Mat K even talked of doing a fourth batch possibly depending on how they want to expand it.They have added a good amount of fishing spots and such to Kourend and well likely see more with the Kourend rework as well as new areas in later batches. Even if some things arent done by the final batch that doesnt mean they cant be done later either. Zeah is part of the world and just like any other kingdom or area it can still expand and grow after it is finished. Since it was made partly as a canvas to get away from crowding the mainland and lore conflicts with RS I am sure well see more in Zeah for years to come.,2007scape,d7al3h0,24,t5_2wbww

8860715,0,t1_d7coske,Read the original comment.gtur actually allowed to have fungtsome people just pk for funNothing you say changes that. I have been PKed more times than i can count especially at wildy bosses but not limited to them. Also agility runite rocks runecrafting doing hardelite clues chinchompas green dragons and what else can you name?Are you really saying that all those people in the wildy doing all those things are entitled and shouldnt be killed? They should just have free reign over the wilderness and anyone who attempts to kill them is automatically scum and a shithead pker and should kill themselves etc?Are you seriously going to rage over what literally k worth of black dhide? One glory worth k that you can craft back in literally  minute? The difference comes when you become a fucking idiot. Why are do you have  black chins without banking? Why are you holding all your nats on you at once instead of banking each trip? Why are you killing green dragons in max str bonus? Why do you have more than  items at chaos ele? Why are you an ultimate iron man whos AFKing in the wildy? True story btwAlso there are plenty of viable training methods outside of the wilderness. You dont have to kill bosses there. You dont have to skill there. Why would you skill there then get mad that you died? Like really? If you want boss tasks but dont want to go to the wildy turn off boss tasks and you can still kill DKS Dags KQ Kalphite Arma Aviansie Zammy demon the list goes on. Stop feeling entitled and getting pissed in an area where anyone can attack you.There are ways to escape there are ways to keep your items you can also do this thing called watching your mini map and if youre killing something in multi just assume that youre going to die no matter what. Before you even enter the wildy say your goodbyes to whatever gear and supplies you have. It is part of the game and you should play as if it were not as if you were god and nobody is allowed to attack you.And finally just try it. When youre bored bank standing in the GE grab k worth of shit and go and kill some kids for fun because it is fun and you dont get any loot and if anything youre losing your k but its fun. If you cant kill pvmers kill green dragon bots youll run into other pkers there and you can have real fights inbetween with other nonmeta pkers.Anyway good luck,2007scape,d7cxlho,1,t5_2wbww

People who light fires in a straight line before running to the back are only going to get like k XPhour.K XPhr is way too close to previously available firemaking methods. Well theyre still available but no way in hell anybody will be doing them anymore. People will only burn redwoods for post XP or after theyve already obtained the pyromancers set.ampnbspAn update should not introduce competitive XP rates excellent GP income AND remove click insensitivity from a skill all at the same time. That is not balanced.I love the idea of group skilling and minigames with usefulness but could they have made this less OP? Profitable firemaking should be at a crappy XP rate not be competitive with methods that are highereffort and costly.ampnbspend mini rant I know my opinion wont change jagexs balancing skills oh well.

I assume its a bit harder for bots to do quests than just grind strength levels which would at least deter some botters albeit mostly small fry ones. I dont know much about botting but I would be incredibly suprised if it increased botting so at worst it will stay even and I dont really think it will harm low level players as much as others have speculated.,2007scape,d7kilg0,1,t5_2wbww

Throughout the previous seasons there were endless DMM posts  stream clips screenshots of big kills rare drops etc  and yet unless ive somehow missed it all theres been practically none this time around.At no point have I suggested DMM to be a waste. I fully appreciate that DMM seasons amp were hugely beneficial to the game with streams drawing massive amounts of interest and thus new players to the game with a strong retention rate of paying members to the game but it felt like this season just didnt take off at all.,2007scape,d7tz7yd,3,t5_2wbww

9057243,0,t1_d80imhc,gt Your no is worth quite a bit when  of the community is needed for questions to pass.Its not worth my time anymore. The community has shifted from what it used to be when OSRS came out. People vote yes to any new content even if its bad content. I used to get myself worked up by some of the updates that were coming into the game such as NMZ and Zulrah but idc too much anymore. Theres nothing I could do to stop it. It took long enough for  hour afking to be patched and that was almost a year of complaining until they fixed it. I dont even worry about new updates anymore most of the time I dont even know what new content is coming out. I try to ignore it because it just makes me angry in the end and it led me to quit for a year at one point. Its not even worth putting my opinion out there because you just get downvoted and called a salty hexis elitist if you go against unbalanced content. Funny thing is Im against a lot of updates that are unbalanced and Im no where close to a hexis elitist. Im  RC and I was against Zeah RC when it came out because of how afk it is.

The only reason that was cited for woox not winning was that he did not participate in the PvP however Mod Ash said that it would be okay to stand at a bank and eat food for the tournament so that would mean that JaGex mislead players at to what the rules are and it would be unfair for them to DQ someone for that.,2007scape,d8d5xv6,2,t5_2wbww

And I dont know how you could possibly read anything Ive written see me mentioning the facts of the game and consider that blind group mentality. I guess Ill have to assume youre just stupid because youre parroting the same shit everyone else says. Its always either Woox abused a bug or Woox broke the rules by not being in the final area or Woox broke the rules by not participating in PvP. Looks like youre going with a combination of the nd and rd pieces of misinformation.gt Now someone explain to me how woox is somehow owed money?Clearly you havent read enough. Let me copy and paste from one of my previous comments some of the nonexistent rules of DMM that people like you keep spouting out. That way you can read them again since you didnt do such a good job the first time. There was no rule requiring you to go to the final area. There was no rule requiring you to fight other players. There was no rule against healing in the fog. There was no rule against using Phials to unnote items. Phials unnoting items is intended game behavior not a bugNow that thats out of the way let me explain what happens to the person who follows all those rules and is the last person alive. They win. I know right how amazingly simple. But wait a minute Woox followed all those rules and he was the last person alive. What does that mean? Well lets connect the dots Woox followed the rules...he was the last person alive...the last person alive that followed the rules is the winner of DMM...the winner of DMM wins money.I hope its clear to you at this point that Woox the winner is owed money. But of course it wont and never will be. Yet you say I have blind faith.,2007scape,d8dvgi8,1,t5_2wbww

9176332,0,t3_55z9ye,Earlier this year Jagex Games Studio was acquired by Shandong Hongda Mining Co Ltd a Chinese mining company. While being great news for Jagex this was not so great news for the UK Government a considerably large backer of the OSRS Documentary. In its conception the documentary was a great way to praise one of the last truly independent games studiopublisher in the UK. Of course the acquisition by a Chinese company changed their independent status and thus prompted the withholding of funds from one of the projects key backers.I hope this makes sense!But I wouldnt worry I think the project has just been pushed back. A lot of it has already been completed by the time of the acquisition.

If youre willing to exchange imps for their loot plus the chance of a Ely thats up to you the only thing youre missing out onnot getting in return for opening them yourself is the clue. if he was keeping the loot from the imps Id have a problem with it cause it would be buying tickets basically but since the only thing he keeps for himself is the clue plus the fact he loses money buying the other clues and gives the clue loot to whom ever got him that clue. I see no problem in it Ive personally donated imps cause a few hundred thousand coins is worth the excitement of watching him open clues even if I never get the ely.

But that has more to do with Jagex focusing actual PvP updates in several different game modes mainly DMM which causes the other content to have less players which results in them feeling dead.So instead of focusing on fixing the problem having less players in the Wilderness they should focus fixing the cause drawing PKers from the Wilderness into other content.Putting defenceless people is not the long term solution.,2007scape,d90boix,0,t5_2wbww

Also the whole affinityweakness system doesnt seem to matter much since like every boss has no weakness and most monsters that do are so weak that you already have enough accuracy anyways.

9383599,0,t3_592gyg,You need to start living for the now rather than constantly having things to look forward to or dwelling on the past. I assume you are somewhat young.. Most people prior to the age of  dont start the career they are truly passionate about until then.. Your s is all about finding out about these things. You are actually a lot more fortunate than others you have not wasted your life away for a job you will not enjoy doing for reasons out of your control and you can now spend the next few years trying new things! Whats the rush!?Having just come out of  years of severe depression PTSD and Anxiety with panic attacks occurring the moment I woke up no therapist piece of advise or resource out there has helped me as much as meditation and buddhismtantra. The whole idea is about living in the now and not living for the future or dwelling on the past. In the  months practicing Mindful Meditation  minute youtube video each day I stopped having severe panic attacks after  days and they have improved daily since to somewhat nothing at all currently. With this freedom I was able to make time to start reading the tantra experience evolution through love Im  chapters in and so far I have noticed massive positive effects in all aspects of my life. I can seriously chat all day about this and am more than happy to give a mountain of advise at anytime. If you can implement what you learn from the book I mentioned above you will never have a reason to seek psychiatric help. Start making some to do lists and heres your first   Youtube Mindful Meditation and follow one of those videos  Get the audio book the tantra experience evolution through love and go for a walk. I would suggest  hourdaily as there is a lot to take in and reflect on.   drop me an inbox in a couple of days and let me know what you think  RSN is Dank Dave im on most evenings  almost maxxed zerk so Ill be starting to PK soon if you want to join me. ,2007scape,d95fqva,1,t5_2wbww

The game is simple enough that at a speedrun level theres barely anything that needs to be communicated once you get your strategies to start giving times under  or so.That said people dont usually speedrun with ironmen because of trading  inventory space.

9430142,1,t1_d9b4xo2,I would definitely say its something that they signed up for when they continued playing that version of the game. A lot of people quit because that was pretty obviously the direction the game was headed with the EOC. It was turning into any other MMO on the planet we all know they follow the exact same framework based around MTX. Those of us that jumped ship and demanded a version of the game worth playing shouldnt be forced into MTX because RS is salty. OSRS is definitely not paid for by RS. While it may not generate near the income that RS does if it was a drain on their profits they wouldnt keep it going. ,2007scape,d9bc2n9,-3,t5_2wbww

Wearing the same melee gear and having a better account in the form of a higher magic level lets say  will increase that modifier to lets say . That is an additional  damage and accuracy that you literally cant counter just because you actually took the time to train a skill.It may not be OP in a sense but it is definitely intuitive and completely against the spirit of the game. ,2007scape,d9cnl05,1,t5_2wbww

But lets do a little comparison to the current ahrim robes. So for the sake of this argument I will talk about the PvM aspect and the PvP aspect of the kodai robes compared to ahrims using the entire set to not confuse anyone even though you would use a different helmet in PvP and PvM in mostly all cases if not all of themThe repair costs of Kodai for a full  hours of usage added up all together would be k per hour for the hood k k per hour for the top k k per hour for the robes k adding up to a grand total of .m for  hours of usage or k with  smithing on an armour stand assuming it will be repairable in that way. Now lets compare that to ahrim without including the weapon which comes to be a grand total of k for the entire set for  hours of usage or k with  smithing on an armour stand. So assuming a player is  smithing the difference of using ahrims compared to kodai robes over a  hour period would be k and without  smithing so repairing with bob it would be a .m difference. In a PvM situation such as zulrah or slayer tasks for example kodai would cost a significant amount more to use than ahrim for no extra damage bonus but only a notable stat of  prayer more overall. Now unless the  extra prayer will cover the prayer potion cost of k.m over a  hour period of use IT WILL NEVER BE WORTH USING KODAI OVER AHRIMS. The other stats are completely negligible as mage accuracy is not as important once you have enough of it and the defensive stats do not matter as much. In a PvP situation it might have an extra kick compared to ahrims but however the risk of the pker would be SIGNIFICANTLY larger for slightly better accuracy and defenses so I doubt it would be used much in the wilderness either. TLDR Kodai will never be worth using over ahrims nevermind ancestral. ,2007scape,d9grido,7,t5_2wbww

Or is it more viable than Ranging and Magic is just that horrible at DPS compared to Range?It would be interesting to see a boss like Graardor where youd mage with range protect and freeze and run to avoid a powerful melee attack...

If youd have read a single word I said youd know that I never said its hard to get but you seem to need to put words into your opponents mouths to have an argument. Its not hard to get it just takes a long time and requires one to maintain focus that whole time as to not die something that is not necessary on any other account. If youve ever afked slayer youd know how easy it is to forget about your hp and die on accident especially if you play a second account.

9493567,0,t3_5atts0,gt Log on to a small cash stack  items in the collect box.Heres how that could happen.  There is a buy limit for each item in the GE.  So what could happen is this You are buying k steel plates for gp each.  No one is selling right now and you go to sleep. While you sleep someone dumps k steel plates for gp each there is no sell limit.   When they do this you immediately buy  steel plates for gp each.  But thats your limit for  hours so its like your offer is out of the GE now.  That guy instantly sells plates to you and other people for prices between  and gp each.  And if there are not enough different buyers to buy all k then he cant sell them all right away. Say theres still like k left for sale when your  hours is up.  Now your order to buy for gp comes back in the GE.  But the other guy is selling for gp each so you get another  but this time for gp.  And youd continue to instantly get  more every  hours assuming someone is selling less than gp and youd get leftover GP for the difference.  But if no one happens to be selling less than  when your order goes in then you pay the full gp assuming you actually get some.gt Additionally how is the guide price calculated? I looked at steel trimmed set lg and guide price was m while the actual price was something like k.The new treasure trail items are still adjusting their prices from initial release since the initial price was Jagexs best guess and the price change is limited to  per day.  And yes that is dumb.You can get a more up to date idea of prices here,2007scape,d9jaa7p,1,t5_2wbww

Ardy cloak is best for cape then use dragon boots and ice gloves important for fareed!. Getting a blessing might be worth it as well. Also take a granite maul and ancient mace. A rock cake go back to the pass under white wolf mountain and get another is also necessary. You can take a barrows gloves switch if you want.Do a customized hard rumble with every boss you can except elvarg dagannoth mother and the RFD bosses. You can also remove Chronozon the tanglefoot and the slaglith.Go into the dream with about  overloads and some  works absorptions. Drink a dose of overload then guzzle on your rock cake down to hp after you have lost  health. Then drink a bunch of absorption potions. Go to town on the monsters when they spawn. When your overload runs out drink another dose. When your health regens guzzle on the rock cake.

9571950,0,t1_d9sttz6,It may play a role. However I still think there are other stronger reasons. For example japan has a conservativeright government. They are not as nationalistic as Trump but overall they are comparable to the usamerican republicans. Immigration is seen critically there.Yet the population absolutely dislikes Trump. Why? Because in their culture values like calmness respect obedience and cautiousness are wanted. Someone who shouts insults and boasts all the time is seen as an embarassment.Or take us germans. We have very little support for Trump as we have learned from history nope I dont mean ww. Building walls and locking a country into its borders wont do any good for a modern country. We are globalized and economicallysocially open for countries that respect humanity. Alone our geographic position doesnt allow protectionism  our approach is to bond with as many countries as possible. Of course this can be seen as good or bad as there are pros and contras.My point is that governments and the people in the rest of the world are different to usamericans. Media may form and strengthen their views but the roots lie deeper. ,2007scape,d9sxs3y,1,t5_2wbww

9626387,0,t1_d9zi2qb,But there IS always a  chance that the effect activates. Every potion has a  chance. That is what I based my calculations on and assuming you wear the amulet for every potion you make that is what the rate is. Pretty easy to come into a thread and state that all the calculations are wrong without actually showing the way you they ought to be done according to you. I hope you understand that if I was not considering the  chance of the effect triggering the effect would be so huge that it would make herblore one of the most profitable skills in the game.. ujamalsbatman has already accurately explained the way I calculated the rates below but in case that still doesnt satisfy Ill try to explain it with a simple example for you.We have  unfinished ranarr potions and  snape grass. I hope you can agree with me that a  proc rate would mean that it takes  potions to use up one whole amulet on average. This costs a total of gp. Making these all into  dose prayer potions would previously have left us with  potions worth a total of gp. A loss of . In the new scenario the total cost is   gp. The new yield would be gp  the value of  prayer potion doses gp  . Resulting in a new loss of . The amount saved is substantially more than .

9628064,0,t3_5cw5lp,Ive been thinking about the original iteration of BH craters for a long time. I would get back into the scene if this was introduced how it was back when they made it semisingle based. I think the only reason bh craters had a bad rep was because it was associated with the removal of trade and wilderness as a whole. I think the original BH craters was a fantastic system that balanced risk and reward. Penalty tanking with item prevention when penalized the whole nine yards. The only thing would be how would you incentivize people to go there as opposed to somewhere else and also maybe even considering adding a minimum risk required. Perhaps some kind of point system based on targetshunters killed that you could spend for pvp armors?,2007scape,d9zuuoz,0,t5_2wbww

9663949,0,t1_da49a31,It may not be  but this is still Old School and things are done as they were back in the day. While Kourend was one big update Zeah was not. Zeah is very much our desert we only have part of the larger are still even if it is a large part.So I wouldnt say that the way it was added was unacceptable. The favor and layout of the area were lacking but for the first project of the size without community feedback it is somewhat understandable. The same is true for Quests OSRS new had any quests and we knew they wouldnt be added on launch and the same has been true for other areas.As for content like Shamans Catacombs Guilds Minecarts Wintertodt and such this is the kinda stuff Id expect to be added over time instead of on release. You may not prefer it but that is how the game has always worked areas arent completely fleshed out on launch and have room to expand and grow over time. In fact the was one of the main reasons they made a new continent in the first place a place to put future content without crowding the older areas and conflicting with lore.,2007scape,da4a8a8,-1,t5_2wbww

Its main selling point was its accuracy which made sense since its damage wasnt nearly as good as an AGS or claws. It was fairly low risk but had fairly high quest requirements. The OSRS team could easily offset this by making it a rare drop from something. Korasi was good at killing people who let their HP fall to pretty low levels. It wasnt a rushing weapon at least without spec restore which we dont have either. The VLS made Korasi look like a twig my character just pulled off a tree too.,2007scape,dabnzup,1,t5_2wbww

9727126,0,t3_5efkkc,Hi there! Welcome to the game.I assume youre a free to play player so Im going to go ahead and suggest you buy the following Steel Mithril and Adamant ScimitarsSteel Mithril and Adamant armour setsAmulet of powerNow if youre still under  attack I strongly suggest you go to the building north of the Eastern Varrock bank and attack the dummies there. They will get you to level  attack extremely quickly.What i suggest you train on is Chickens Cows  Dark Wizards south of VarrockBy now you will have a decent amount of runes to train magic and enough money for a rune scimitar and a few pieces of rune armour. You can now proceed to killing hillmoss giants under EdgevilleVarrock. You want to bury every bone you get until you reach level  prayer. Here comes the fun part.In level ish Wilderness theres this place called Demonic Ruins. Here you can find greater demons. It is also the only place in runescape where your prayer points will passively regenerate. What you want to do is get some monk robes from the GE your rune scimitar and any meleeoriented amulet and use your protect from Melee prayer. This will ensure that the demons will never hit you and also you will never run out of prayer points since you regenerate them faster than they drain. These demons drop rune full helms which I think go for around  coins right now plus they are decent experience to kill. And of course you want to do every FP quest especially Dragon Slayer.,2007scape,dac2y1m,49,t5_2wbww

If you have this mindset then you understand that doing something you enjoy is the only important thing in life because that timer is just gonna keep counting down. If you see playing this game as a waste of time then dont do it... change your time waste into something else go work a few more hours or spend a couple more hours with your parents or get together with your friends and go do something for a couple hours in the end it doesnt matter your just changing your time wasting to something else but hey maybe if you make some ridiculous amount of money or have  billion friends youll be happy? As for some day this all being insignificant... it probably will be. But who cares by then youll be dead and no matter what you think happens next the problems of when you were alive wont matter at all.

9965446,0,t1_db6hbjy,Thanks for your clarification.Could you investigate how much development time it would take to prioritize the Player Moderator crown over the Ironman symbol in the chat but keep the Ironman icon next to the players name?Also if players cant see the Player Moderator crown then they cant ask what that crown means. So essentially it means that they should never have to say I am a Player Moderator by answering that question. A good Player Moderator should also not threaten people by saying I canwill mute you they would instead just report the player and mute if necessary.I now understand its a policy but by doing so Jagex kinda neglects  for a lack of a better word that part of the community and I sincerely hope that there will be a solution soon.On another note say an Ironman is eligible for Player Mod but is then declined for being an ironman. Would it be possible to offer it on another of his or her alts if he regularly plays them? I assume that Jagex checks all related accounts and thus knows our alts or they can simply ask us to choose one which then gets checked again. I dont know its just a random thought.Edit Another question what if a RS Player Moderator decides to play OSRS instead and creates an ironman. What happens to their PMod status? I assume that their crown wont be visible either...,2007scape,db6iuyr,5,t5_2wbww

9966287,0,t1_db6kwhm,it should have a different PVP special attack based off range level similar to Morigans Javalins.  Depending on how the harpoons tip is designed the bleed effect speical attack from Morigans Javs could even be used and make sense. The harpoon can break in PVP combat providing a sink for harpoons.  Having them come from raids would mean they would consistently be of decent value and could also be semicommon drops due to the sink. Or perhaps the harpoon will be stronger than a normal harpoon giving you the ability to pierce tougher fish skin.  Making it so you will be able to harpoon a new type of fish on top of tuna and swordfish?  Would also be interesting since it definitely wouldnt provide the best EXP rates due to catching alot of tuna and swordfish so you could make it a new highest level fish to catch.   ,2007scape,db6mt5l,1,t5_2wbww

10000104,0,t1_dbay2xw,I read through your comments and am interested into how clinical she was initially in her handjobs if I for whatever reason had to masturbate a male friend or family member of mine I would try to make my technique as uniform and devoid of personality as possible. It sounds like your mother initially framed her offer as just fulfilling a basic physical need and things escalated gradually over time. Did she vary speed and pressure focus on different parts of the penis switch to just stroking your head or testicles etc.? Are you circumcised? Was it purely a pumping closed hand thing or would she ever just stroke one finger up and down the shaft and whatnot?I guess I mostly want to know how much personality and sensuality she initially put into your handjobs versus a purely clinical robotic approach and how much of her technique involved communication between the both of you beyond the pure physical aspects. Beyond the pure physical sensation of being masturbated was there anything she did initially that was a particular turnon for you? I guess since you were too incapacitated to masturbate yourself this wouldnt have initially been the case but did she ever encourage you to grope her? Was she ever topless or nude during the handjob stage? Did any handjobs ever take place in the shower or bathtub?Would she increase the speed and instensity to get you to cum? How hard would you say you came compared to when you normally masturbated? Any vocal encouragement to cum after saying just relax and let go the first time? After cumming would she continue to masturbate you for a few seconds? Did she ever comment on your ejaculations in a way meant to turn you on? Did her handjobs start off clinically and gradually get more sensual after a period of weeks before progressing to oral? You said there was no dirty talk but she was clinical in her descriptions of what she was doing in a way that got you off could you give any examples? How turned on were you by the communication. Did either of you ever laugh just cause of the absurdity of the situation?Did you look at each other at all during this? If you did did she try to turn you on with her facial expressions? A warm maternal smile meant to get you to relax and release or a dirtier sultry eyebrow raised expressions. I can only imagine how your face looked initially the first few times do you think she was turned on by this? If you did look at each other would she maintain eye contact as you ejaculated and would she smile when you finally came?This is kind of dumb but my own personal fantasy surrounding your situation is me wearing pajama pants or sweats getting a large and obvious erection and then walking to your mom reading on the couch and just kind of motioning at the situation and she puts her book down smiles and says ok. Did anything remotely similar to this ever happen?I think it is clear by how this progressed that your mother must have had some level of attraction to you could you initially tell this was the case?,2007scape,dbb1jac,9,t5_2wbww

10012950,0,t1_dbcp6k4,Ironmen cant use MTX IIRC they also dont need any of the ads so thats always an option.    For me personally I dont care too much about cosmetic MTXs. It doesnt bother me. I dont think the XP is a major issue either. It doesnt take away prestige from achievements because the prestige has been gone for a while. Back in the day when we were all much younger we admired players like Zezima and The Old Nite. Their levels and XP were mindboggling and incomprehensible. But now all the most efficient rates methods are common knowledge. What limits someones XP gains isnt knowhow or skill its solely a factor of time. For me at least its not impressive anymore.  What I do dislike about MTX however is the way it shifts Jagexs priorities. An understandably significant portion of resources are allocated to the MTX team because Jagex is ultimately a business. But for my playstle this isnt a recipe for more engaging gameplay.    The good news is that the game devs and mods still have the same priorities. Its clear how much they care about the content they make. They are devoted to improving the game because its something they are truly passionate about and I see that in every update and development diary.,2007scape,dbcpsn3,7,t5_2wbww

Between those particular books are Transportation Incantations and I believe Souls Journey. If you read the first one you gain access to a lvl  teleport that teleports you to the middle of Great Kourend while the latter starts a miniquest from which you can get an item that sends ensouled heads straight to your bank IIRC.These books change location every once in a while so people post its location here.,2007scape,dbfdezw,3,t5_2wbww

10080204,0,t1_dblfawb,In case you didnt read through the comments I was active in the FP pvp community from  until late . I know what the scene was like I know the evolution of the community with various gear updates and other things and I did a lot of solo pking and warring too. I dont PvP anymore because my interests have changed. But that doesnt mean I know nothing about the environment. FP UIM is just something to occupy my time the last few months. I dont want to do game design. I made this in paint in  minutes. The point is to create discussion and hear both sides of the argument. I think these simple updates to preexisting content as a whole would be a big benefit to the FP landscape. I know you dont care about how you or your clan is viewed but your clans attitude and antics will eventually and inevitably destroy the PvP scene entirely because of your vulgarity and your opposition to change. All that will remain will be your incest hate filled clan. But maybe thats for the best. I rescind my suggestions and hope that your clan implodes the PvP scene the possibility of ever reviving DMM into a functional tournament and maybe it can be like  all over again and Jagex can just remove the aids fest that is PvP just like the good ole days. It would be a good day when OSRS tries to stop becoming an e sport and just gets rid of the broken PvP system and the cancerous people that come with it.,2007scape,dblgyl4,1,t5_2wbww

You need to make sure that you deposit only  ores each time. If you deposit  then the dispenser will be full and not let you add more. But as long as you only have  bars waiting to be collected then you can add a full inventory of ore. If the dispenser reaches  bars then just start over by emptying it and repeating the cycle again with only  ores the first time. ,2007scape,dbor1di,2,t5_2wbww

Hell no he laughs it off or they get banned your emotional state wont change how people online treat you and that joke wasnt even that bad... its no joke that when you stop your stream because of heart palpitations which he has! So yeah hes killing himself and the joke was made in context of him abusing his body to try and be a successful streamer which I wouldnt support anyway so fuck him hes a cry baby who decided to go in front of hundreds of people and get butt hurt when someone makes a joke about him clearly killing himself.

It should be man if this is on the low side I cant imagine how many they ban. Theyve released info on this before. I mean if you guys dont want to believe it then thats fine but considering neither of us are behind the monitors to view these things its pointless putting on tinfoil hats about it. Jagex has proven time and time again that although they dont do everything perfect they at least have an honest integrity about everything to make the game the best it can be. I think thats enough.If even  of people who complain in this subreddit could do better at the level of intensity they criticize Jagex for then Id fucking love to see it.,2007scape,dbx4os3,33,t5_2wbww

10209253,0,t1_dc1829s,Any game in the smash bros series. Z cancel in  wavedashing in melee and other misc stuff in brawl are great just not as huge influence like dacus though not like pot boost is a big deal. Halo  weaponpowerup nading was intended but not to the extent of the devs. Like nading powerups on spawns from the bottom to top or top to bottom was definitely not Intended. They just thought it would befun to bounce shit around not developer competitive strats with it. Button glitches in halo  were awesome too but the primary gun was accidentally changed to be perfectly acurate in a patch which revolutionized the game. The weapon went from inaccurate at m to accurate at m which changed maps and starts entirelyfor the better. Speedrun starts in general make games tons of fun to speed run even if only to make the game not take  hours to complete. Disocvering new time saving strats because you can get an item earlier than intended or skip a room is so much fun. Notable examples are mario and leged of zelda series. Runescape classic and runescape appeal to a mass of people exactly because you can make a character how you want. The devs did not expect people to make pures and diverse account builds are incredibly good for rs pvp and adds tons of revenue to jagex because of multiple accounts. ,2007scape,dc19xqb,4,t5_2wbww

10210103,0,t1_dc0mo4l,gtI said people wouldnt play the game without rewards.There are rewards! To that you would say not everyone gets them well its a competition!Dont you understand what it means when you want to add item rewards? It means that you are not having fun playing the actual minigame so you want to get something out of it so you can go have fun elsewhere. The perfect example you gave earlier was when you said to add BIS pure gear. That mean you want people to just grind LMS so they can go pk. And thats why people would still play as boring minigame as spam clicking a button if they got rewards out of it so they can go have fun elsewhere. That is a stupid way of doing it though because players would be more likely to quit trying to even get the reward compared to pest control for example since it would be way more boring and annoying. LMS was made so players have fun THERE not somewhere else and thats why you want to prioritize improving the gameplay not to add items for other content.Majority of opponents that I fought in LMS didnt know how to pray flick and would always get frustrated about it. Its so obvious that casual players hate prayer flicking.,2007scape,dc1det0,1,t5_2wbww

OSBuddy gives an unfair advantage in game to its users over users of the official client through many timers and pieces of critical information fed to you without having to manually and in more time taken obtain it yourself thus not complying with Jagexs rules on third party programs.

10275404,0,t3_5n4acy,Correct me if Im wrong but the ruby bolt spec has a   chance with Hard Kandarin Diary of occuring which is  chance. With crossbow on rapid it takes on average  sec between every ruby bolt spec hit assuming you get a success hit every time. With blowpipe you can perform  attacks in  sec on rapid. To me that doesnt seem as a huge difference in DPS so nerfing it to hit  max is just bad for ruby bolts e since Raids literally are the perfect type of content for what these bolts are meant to be useful at.,2007scape,dc8rtoy,2,t5_2wbww

10320262,0,t3_5nrnap,There was an idea posted on here a while back that might help with this. If it is possible include an estimated dev time required to make the update happen something like very low low moderate heavy very heavy. I assume the majority of players arent simply trying to ruin the fun of other players by not allowing updates to their game modes. More likely they think that the dev time required to make these updates would limit updates to their own game mode. If someone saw an update that would have no direct effect on them but might take a lot of time and effort to produce thus prolonging the updates they want they might vote no just to be safe. If they instead knew that the update was going to be a quick change they might be more inclined to vote yes since doing so would have little to no effect on them. edit I suppose the downside here is that people voting yes might change their vote to no if they see that a project they thought would be short ends up taking a lot of time. However I think more people would probably change from no to yes than from yes to no.,2007scape,dcduwsw,1,t5_2wbww

10322008,0,t3_5nsql1,I think we should at least wait for Brimstone before adding a Diary but I hope we see it sometimes this year. Im not sure what is going on with the Southern region and how big that will be. If it is just that one kingdom then the diary should wait for it. If it is more than that like the whole Colosseum stuff still perhaps it could get a separate diary E.g. North Zeah and South Zeah or something like that. Either way the current area does seem big enough with enough content for a Diary it is just a matter of how much is left.Anyway I like the proposed tasks for the tiers and I think a blessing like item would be a nice reward. Perhaps it could instead be a Quiver and hold ammo so rangers arent at a disadvantage they said it was possible with the Insignias so it should work here. The suggested rewards also sound nice. Id also suggest more teleports to the Xerics Talisman andor teleport redirects. Perhaps Daily Saltpeter could be a reward similar to the daily resources from other diaries. Maybe something to buff grape farming too. I am sure there are a lot of other potential rewards too that I cant think of right now.,2007scape,dce21i2,1,t5_2wbww

10375315,0,t3_5okwfp,At the time I was really hoping sailing would pass. But looking back on it Im actually ok with it failing. I think the teams priorities shouldve been on already existing skills and fixing the issues with Zeah which have been addressed. I mean have you seen Wests redone Zeah? Its freaking awesome. Plus Raids have been incredible as well. I think if Jagex was to ask about creating a new skill provided theyre up for some new ideas besides Artisan and sailing the community will be more open to the idea. I mean Raids was a massive update that had no major issues on release likely thanks to the fact that they admitted it wasnt ready to go when they originally thought it would and they delayed it. Sure delays suck but the end result is so much better because of it. I have a lot of confidence that theyd be able to pull off a new skill given they didnt feel compelled to rush it because of their schedule. ,2007scape,dck3s3o,21,t5_2wbww

No sense of community whatsoever since every skilling spot in incredibly afk. I mean seriously Im all for afk stuff but I think there needs to be a limit.In reality though the worst type of people come forth when you want to do any sort of end game PvP. Its why I like the solo bosses so much more. Vorago is fucking packed with wand scammers and general elitist cunts that have to be carried but say dumb shit like no carry noob. Raids is fucking turbo aids with trying to find a learners team. RoTs is outclassed by the other bosses until you get to the absolute highest proficiency with it so hardly anyone plays it compared to the other bosses.   Theres ccs to help you but none of them really help you. Its more like the cc uses you since you literally get less of a split for some sort of learners fee bullshit though the RoTS cc was actually very nooblearner friendly and I cant think of a negative to it. I was even a teacher rank in it. So maybe Im bias.Rants aside RSs community is just as bad if not worse than OSRSs community simply for the holier than thou act they put forth whilst hiding their own demons. At least in osrs you just get fucking memed on or some dumb shit so you can simply ignore the twat doing it. RSs community goes for personal attacksdoxxingtwitter drama fucking  and every other form of bullshit that people do in osrs. TLDR Both communities can beare awful. ,2007scape,dcoeqwx,-1,t5_2wbww

10444413,0,t1_dcry9bp,gtHaving the noted bones from diary doesnt mean only those people belong there.Youre wasting your time killing DKS without access to the main source of money that they drop. gtBut they can still crash you when youre killing the dags it just becomes a dps race for kills.Which shouldnt be an issue if you have the stats for the boss. Some maxed player will crash you eventually but if youre getting consistently beaten by crashers you should just go RC instead so you can get noted bones and so you can buy the gear you need to do the boss effectively. ,2007scape,dcryhav,-2,t5_2wbww

10448216,0,t3_5pn0nx,If you are a beginner dont bother being a pure. Pures are for PvP. If you dont see yourself doing PvP avoid it. Pures have a hard time training without using watersports and have limited options to money make using combat. They are also very expensive to build. Unless of course you like a lil challenge and wish to stay limited to have fun. Then I understand.I agree. You should get the k first for the nice lil starting cash.Anyways.... If you are fp and need money you should train your crafting enough to start smithing gold bracelets. Kill some cows tan the cowhide and craft them into the highest possible item you can make. From there make a trip to the GE and buy as many gold bars as you can. And start crafting gold bracelets. Repeat till you can craft sapphire rings. From there craft sapphire ring for some easy starting cash. Possibly kk gp an hour. Last time I checked. It gets easier the more money you have.Use the money to buy yourself the best fp gear you can buy ranging from normal bow to maple bow. Bronze scimitar to rune scimitar. Iron armour to rune armour.etc.Go to security stronghold and train ur range on minotaurs they drop arrows which u can use for range. Camp it out till you are  cmb stats including range.That should keep you busy for a few days or so.,2007scape,dcseaig,4,t5_2wbww

10461904,0,t1_dctsv5u,EDIT Dont get me wrong I would love the idea.Alright think of it this way a possible glitch would be having someone stand next to a blocked off area because of a  tile thick wall here is an Example. Were going to assume that it is impossible to get into the red outlined area. If you can teleport someone next to you Jagex needs to have a way to check that the person will not be teleported into the red outlined area. Which yea not a big deal just mark those spots as you cant be placed here right? This isnt a big deal except that they would have to do this with a large portion of the game. Any area that is blocked by any content would require that jagex go and specifically mark it as impossible to be teleported into. This would include but is not limited to quest locked areas skill locked areas achieve diary locked areas all out of bounds any area that requires a key and more. If they miss just one area it could easily chain out of control.TlDr The safety checks they would have to make would be crazy and probably not worth the dev time  the chance at bringing future problems into the game.,2007scape,dctyott,1,t5_2wbww

So if someone dropped a shit ton of logs on your stuff the logs would go away before your firecape. What Im assuming happened is that because untradables were given high value some guy just dropped a shit ton of untradables which therefore despawned his firecape torso etc. Which would explain why no items showed up at all in the pile.

To me it seems like people want it banned because of the advantage as stated earlier in this post a meager  and most of the top players dont use it for efficiency because you dont need to for things like t wc lavas t mining etc it may give. Honestly I dont give a flying fuck about how others play this game or how much farther ahead of me someone may be because theyve AFK trained in NMZ splashed tick manipulated skills etc. Everything in this game except for PvP is casual theres no competition otherwise unless you make it yourself.So Ill keep using my  AHK scripts.,2007scape,dcvwzt1,2,t5_2wbww

10480726,0,t1_dcw2eat,Pre nerf scrolls ranged between m not counting the  as it was a  time panic thing also not counting the current ish as its due to panic.Rigour is the best purchase on  in terms of dps better than a twisted bow but people are reluctant because it cannot be resold. It has a very low supply due to being rare and from a boss that very few people do compared to on release thats completely normal the hype has died down.Fixing the drop rate doesnt nerf rigour though it just increases the demand. Right now the demand is very low because people are afraid that prices will drop for this reason the scroll is very cheap compared to previously.What will happen when the drop rate is changed? First of all people will flock to raids hoping to get scrolls. This wont last too long as it will still take a long time to actually obtain the scrolls people are impatient. Then over a few days or even weeks people will buy the scrolls knowing that they will never be more common so its either buy now or wait a long time for them to drop a tiny amount dont forget there is very high demand for these.So now we have another state of high demand for scrolls with even lower supply from raids than before seeing as less people will raid with all the items constantly crashing claws down m in a few days ancestral set down m in a couple of days maul down m bow down m since last week scrolls now down m there will be less supply  although as raids are fun there will always be some supply.In short as the supply will rise slightly the demand will rise equally  all the people currently saying that rigour is overpriced are saying that because they want rigour they want it to be cheaper but they still want it. Meanwhile it is currently cheap and people who want it are waiting for the update so they can flock to buy it.Scrolls are consumables as we know so most of them that are bought in the GE disappear from the game unless they are flipped which is commonly done so nobody will be able to dump scrolls and satisfy any rise in demand causing a price spike.Cant really think of anything else right now but Ill add to this if I feel like changing it.,2007scape,dcw3k4u,4,t5_2wbww

It does not operate by itself it does not selfsustain anything and its not capable of providing any advantage without your userinput. Im not saying AHK isnt an advantage I am however saying that your definition of automation is far from correct. A bot is automation. Macros that cycled after only  input or after a series of inputs were automation. What you saw people using AHK for in RCminingetc is just drop distances controlled by a human keypress.  A human presses key the mouse moves  pixels down. Identically through Windows Mouse Keys a human presses num the mouse moves  pixels down.Neither are automation and the only difference between the two in the above situation is the flexibility to bind to a different key than num.,2007scape,dcxptu0,2,t5_2wbww

10499016,0,t3_5qbq35,I think their reasoning makes sense. The problem is that Comp Cape would be BiS even if it ties with Max Cape that is still BiS. I am sure there are a lot of Maxed Players who would vote against a new skill and I have seen players oppose new Quests because theyd lose their cape too.But with a Comp Cape these problems would be worse because more content affects it. We dont see many new skills so it isnt as much of an issue for a Max Cape but we see a lot of new comp requirements. And there is basis for this since it already happened in RuneScape . Players dont get the Comp Cape just because they like completing things they get it because it is BiS and once they earn it they dont want to have to work to keep it. It is the same as how more players cared about Maxing in OSRS once it gave a BiS cape some may hate skilling but they do it because the cape is useful.The thing is Completionists dont need a cape. There should be some better recognition or some way to track but it doesnt have to be a cape or a BiS item. Completion shouldnt be an expectation for players it should be something you do because you want to and you enjoy it. Rewarding BiS items for it takes away from that and gives the wrong message.Edit it is also worth noting they didnt say no Comp Cape at all! but that they wont offer a Comp Cape that useful. If it is a cape it would likely end up as more than cosmetic originally the Max Cape was cosmetic and look at it now. A Comp Cape would at least inherent Max Cape effects but it is likely players would ask for it to gain Quest Cape Diary Cape and Music Capes perks too making it better than Max. And their concern is more the future than right now weve seen how the Max Cape has been buffed in a bit over a year imagine how much Powercreep a Comp Cape could have over five years...

I can do perfect switches consistently and my mouse doesnt even move in the exact same movement every time like this guy. I have s of hours nh experience and it is very obvious to me. who cares lol. He is shit compared to most nhers I play with. Like hed legit get bodied playing against people like me who are dedicated nhers and dont use auto switchers. When Im not at school gym studying or with friends I just practice nhing on private servers every chance I get some days  hours. Theres at least  dedicated nhers I can think of off the top of my head who i play against regularly every day on different servers that would blow a player like this out of the water. Hes slow as fuck no fakes no delays no  ticks he misses s constantly and his character movement is not on the level of a great nher. Doing simple  way switches against clueless players is really not hard.I am in the process of making a no honor montage ive been collecting clips for weeks just need to cut and compile them all and I will post it to this subreddit soon when I am finished. You will see the massive difference between someone like this who is slow and uses an autoswitcher and someone like me who can switch faster without an autoswitcher and fluidly change my playstyle because Im actually doing the clicks manually.The thing about using an autoswitcher is he has to use it because he is slow in the brain. He just bullies retards who have no clue how to pk on osrs. Legit wouldnt be able to keep up vs a real nher. Thats just factedit sorry for rant. nhing is just an art form I am passionate about and its sad seeing shit players like this even getting as much attention as they get. mark my words when I release my frag video I will be seen as one of the goat nhers second only to backbne for the time being,2007scape,dd3jigl,3,t5_2wbww

10553350,0,t1_dd48kd3,I think the point which he isnt articulating but is going for is a slippery slope argument. Which typically arent terrible convincing however for the moment well give his argument some clout in order to discuss it. He is wrong that the ragger was there for xp he was getting xp but it wasnt his primary source of xp. You must have at least partial completion of monkey madness to get to ape atoll which requires some knowledge of the game. Lets say enough to know killing cows on a low competition world is more xp and less dangerous than hunting birds on ape atoll. So that argument is totally dead it can not be said he was here for xp he should and does know better.However the point he was going for was if Jmods are banning this whats next? How soon before calling lynxtitan a dick anywhere in the world gets you a mute. If emily happened again would crying with a bald character get you autobanned?

Thishas deserted areas that were otherwise heavily populated with woodcutters Varrock palace Seers Church etc. In addition to this Firemaking logs above level  is simply not efficient due to wintertodt. What if firemaking experience is increased for a short timeafter cutting logs off of a tree?

10584908,0,t3_5rhciy,I played a RSPS a while back that had this feature down pretty nicely. They had it so that if you had lets say  black demon kills left on your solo task and someone comes in and crashes you you just ask how many they had left. If they had  left to kill you needed to bring your  down to  and then use the Enchanted Gem on the other player and boom youre cooping the task.  kills split however you want. Then you could leave or get a new task together. Not too different from OSRS but it had way more QOL aspects. I found it made slayer so much more fun and less toxic when trying to slay bosses or crowded monsters. You still get exp and you keep your own drops.,2007scape,dd7r2rz,1,t5_2wbww

If that the case you and the other guy being defensive yourself considering I didnt bash OSRS in my first comment just called your estimates out for being incorrect.gtJagex might call RS the main game but if not for MTX RS would pale in comparison in almost every aspect. Player count advertising profit exposure. If RS dropped MTX playercount and exposure would rise immensely due to how many people have quit RS or not started it due to the aggressive MTX that is ingame. To think that only profit would change with the removal of MTX shows ignorance.gtAlso I can confidently say MTX is the reason RS has as many jmods as it does Duh? RS is the main moneymaker for Jagex makes sense for them to put the majority of their employees on it.gt If RS suddenly stopped OSRS could easily be its own game and still hold great profit.

10701434,0,t1_ddjrk4r, Not really.Defense does absolutely nothing for your exp gains per hour. So the ideal fastest way is to level up attack and strength at a  ratio. Every attack level get strength up and repeat til  both stats. Then focus on  def as youll be reaching maximum exp per hour all the way up to level  for def. Also its been proven that you lose a fraction of exp when you do controlled. Due to the way the runescape engine is structured it cant do certain things with exp. when you hit on controlled it will divide the exp to all  stats accordingly and any remainder is scrapped. Edit the only time defense has any impact on exp per hour is when your either  defense and having to bank for food frequently or fighting higher level monsters. In that case its advisable to get   or  def. ,2007scape,ddjruqj,2,t5_2wbww

10703991,0,t3_5t4c3m,There are a few suggestions I have this is by no means an order to do them in just general suggestions on things you might want to get done. Level up your agility. OSRS has a series of agility courses called rooftop agility theres one in almost every major town in the game. Theyre like every other agility course except for the fact that they periodically reward you with an item called Mark of GraceWill appear as a yellow badge on the ground keep an eye out. Marks of Grace can be used to purchase the Graceful armour which reduces your overall weight. Having a decent agility level is also very convenient when you want to get around as OSRS has a faster run drain rate and doesnt have the rest feature of RS. Level up your slayer. Its a cliche around here at this point but its really the best way to level up. If you can tough it through the first  levels it gets much better. Its also much more enjoyable than spending hundreds of hours killing sandcrabs. Work towards quest requirements. This is a great way to set some lowmedium level goals for yourself. Start working on requirements for Heroes quest Recipe for Disaster Desert Treasure and other major quests. Find something to do while bankstanding. We all love just standing around doing nothing staring at our screens but if youre gonna do that be productive at the same time! I personally keep a few thousand logs in my bank so whenever I dont feel like doing anything I just fletch some bows.Runescape is a great game with a lot to do just pick what you enjoy and do it.,2007scape,ddk1cfo,3,t5_2wbww

10739677,0,t1_ddnpsx9,gt I dont think its against the rules as Jagex have openly said that private servers are okay as long as they stay out of public RuneScape and private servers use Jagexs models. Although using them for D printing may be a different topic as theres potential to make money from D printing someone elses models.gt I would argue that its safe and legal as long as you keep the models to yourself and not use them commercially though dont quote me on that.gt There are programs that rip your current rendered scene and save it as a single object you could do that and just cut out the demon though Im not sure if thatll work since its based on DirectX.gt Lastly look at how private servers implement custom models. They use the RuneScape cache installed on their PC but that requires using a Dat Viewer or something if I recall correctly. uskelebob,2007scape,ddnpt56,0,t5_2wbww

10775592,0,t1_ddg4w59,Well Im an actual software developer who sets up instances with AWS at work. It is very possible to deal with a DDoS attack. AWS allows us to scale our instances based on the number of calls. If our calls get high we will spin up more instances for the server for a short period of time to handle the DDoS attack. We would only end up with a minute of a slow service for the time it takes to spin up the extra instances. We also get to set the timer of when to spin back down to a normal number of servers or use the number of calls to determine when to spin back down. The answer for handling DDoS attacks is to have a timer. I dont know what Runescape uses but Im betting it isnt AWS since they could solve this problem with scaling during the attacks. ,2007scape,ddrfap4,0,t5_2wbww

10864157,0,t1_de0ja2w,But realistically theres nothing theyre not already doing that they can do to improve on the situation. Ask yourself would you really let your cash cow stay sick for any amount of time if you could avoid it? Theyre a business They dont WANT the game to be unplayable thats BAD for them. Likewise getting better servers is a meme that shows how little people understand what the underlying issue really is. better servers isnt a solution its just something that sounds like it might fix it to someone not well versed in this specific topic. Theres always been complaints about servers because OSRS is one of if not THE MOST brutal game in terms of risk vs reward  I cant think of many if any other games where your enemy has the chance to win all your items if they defeat you symbolising houndreds of real world dollars or alternatively houndreds of hours of work gathering the currency to pay for the items. This makes it a prime target for DDOS attacks while in a game like WoW theres just... No reason for it. Sure one of the top guilds had their HUGELY populated server lag out for a bit during the most recent race but that could just as easily have been because their server is MASSIVE and a new raid release had many more people than normal logging in.In essence what Im saying is  the community has grown up and become more focused on efficiency more focused on accumulating wealth and more cutthroat in their tactics. We rarely saw these tactics  years ago because the game was still relatively young and the playerbase in their early teens. Now that the majority of the playerbase is late teens or young adults things are a lot different. Add to this easier access to technology and its clear why it is so hard to protect against something that realistically isnt anyone who can protect against. I mean for crying out loud if Sony Mastercard and Reddit themselves can get overwhelmed what the fuck do you expect Jagex to do? Often the only way to stop these attacks are depending on either catching the guy doing it or hoping he gets bored and stop. Theres only so many safety measures that can be applied and theyre never  secure.,2007scape,de0k7f1,2,t5_2wbww

10914866,0,t1_de5phcv,Huh. Not to turn it into a dick measuring contest but thats just blatantly wrong. The UK has if I recall correctly the th largest economy in the world. You dont tell the th largest guy out of  that hes a pussy do you? Just because the British empire isnt a thing doesnt mean that you know what youre talking about. Depending where they are in the world it matters a lot. Asia? They probably get away. Anywhere in Europe? Theyd be arrested and tried in their own country. North America? They wouldnt be extradited theyd get a nasty call from the FBI. The reality is that most countries stand to gain from catching international criminals. Whilst its just ddosing its actually a pretty fucking big deal. America in particular has started calling stuff like that cyber terrorism. If you think that most countries wouldnt love the chance to catch a criminal like that then youre gonna have to show your workings.

10978993,0,t1_dece39y,I think its fair to say there used to be more people playing the game in general not just at castle wars. There are also a lot more people who enjoy playing efficiently and aiming for skilling goals than there were in  which results in less people playing minigames purely for fun which is okayAdding incentives like xp rewards will just lead to more people afking on the rd floor and potentially even castle wars bots. How about we just leave castle wars alone,2007scape,decfn6u,5,t5_2wbww

10985856,0,t3_5wtb7c,Currently using this right now on my Note . Have been for a few weeks. So far Ive done alching crafting and a shit ton of Range and Mage in NMZ with it with a lot of success. I get like  FPS though so I wouldnt recommend doing anything remotely dangerous or anything that scales with precision because you wont have it. NMZ is by far the most efficient thing Ive done using it because with auto retaliate and pray melee all I have to do is keep prayer points up and I get almost the same xp as if I were on my computer. I say almost because I dont bother getting the powerups unless they appear right on the screen. I dont know if its just me or my phone but the past few days Ive been having problems with it throwing an out of memoryheapspace error and locking up forcing me to restart everything to play again.

10988106,0,t3_5wwuv5,This could be interesting but as you mentioned this wouldnt work. With that said lets pretend that it could work. What i would propose instead of just a straight loan is put up collateral. For example SGS fury BCP etc. Think of it like a pawn shop. You go in they value the collateral give you a GP figure for the item. They set up the time frame of re payment interest payment amount etc. and the loan is intact and secure.Now this addresses several of your points. Obviously if the loan is not paid as indicated you lose your ability to retrieve your item that you put up for collateral. Now on a side note lets pretend that instead of requiring collateral lets do the loans as you stated straight up GP for whatever amount you want but you have to make payments on an agreed stand point. This is interesting as it brings up several issues predominantly relating to defaulting not paying back the loan and letting your account be closed and fraud taking the money moving it to another account etc. Something that you could set up with Runescape Bank is have their account available to still play but their assets are frozen. What I mean specifically is their bank account would not be accessible. The bank would have this freeze in place until the loan is paid in full. Now this brings up an interesting point in that if the bank has frozen the bank account for the particular user then the bank could repossess the items in the account to try and recoup their loan. With the ability to still play while the bank is frozen this would allow the user to repay the debt by working. Fishing sharks WC etc. They would then sell the items but the money would go directly to the bank. Now something you could set up in order to prevent fraud is place a time frame limit on how soon you could tradedropexchange the funds to another player. That hard part about this is how do you allow a player to get a loan trade a player for a BCP but not allow that same player to trade the money to an alt and run with the money. This brings up account status. My theory would be that depending on how established your account is will determine what abilities you would have with getting a loan. Meaning a level  would not have the same abilities to get a loan as a maxed account. This brings up the concept of risk assessment and strategic lending. Expanding on the points above a level  w base stats requesting a loan for b is extremely risky. Now a maxed account with items in the bank asking for b isnt nearly as risky as the ability to collect the debt if the loan defaults is much more likely. So what this means is that for a base level  the time limit in place to tradedropetc the funds to another account are greater than the maxed account. And this is to minimize the possibility of fraud. Well I pretty much wrote the project for you but this gives you some ideas on the implementation of lending in runescape as well as IRL. GL Bud. ,2007scape,dedgtom,2,t5_2wbww

Im not sure if it was the original owner or what. TheBaby got no warning of the name being taken either no message nothing. All he got was a prompt to name his character.

11110562,0,t1_dercoly,Thats false though.I play RS infact Im playing it right now on a HCIM. However we both know that blanket statement you just made is terribly false.Everything else is superior other than PvP? How about the incessent micro transactions that spam our screen even after paying Jagex  a month? How about all the quest bosses preeoc that are now laughable versions to what they used to beseriously make a new account and try to fight the jungle demon for MM it is quite clear how EoC completely destroyed it vs the OSRS version. Weapons are no longer unique anymore. What is the difference between a drygore rapier and a drygore longsword? From what I can tell they both have the same damage and accuracy. What is the point of making two different weapons if they are the same at everything? RS loses to OSRS in how unique certain items are. Right now RS is focused on whether you are using Mage Range or Melee. Which is why switchscape is such a big deal over on the RS subreddit. However OSRS focuses on which style you use like above but also whether you are using slash rapid accurate defense etc. While we have some of that with the EoC I find little difference between using bolts at an enemy weak to arrows right now.Moreover however the fact is that yes we have bosses through EoC but in that time EoC threw away  years of content for the last  years of content we have received. A lot of the older contentsuch as  PvP is a shadow of its former self. While Jagex have tried relentlessly to bring it backWarbands Bounty Hunter no matter what they do it doesnt seem to do anything.That is why IMO the best option to repairing RS PvP and a bunch of other features is to bring back Darkscape postcombat changes. Then we might have a game worth playing for anyone that wants to do more than slay a couple bosses that you practically REQUIRE a maxed account for.,2007scape,derdfgj,1,t5_2wbww

Why would enjoying grinding on RS be any better or worse than any other hobby you do purely for fun? How is it any different than wasting countless hours on any other video game? You treat it as if it is this terrible thing but you have yet to explain why other than apparently its masochistic? How?,2007scape,deufvfz,1,t5_2wbww

Either way if I said my dream item was a fury or twisted bow I wouldnt get either of them. Idiot. Heres a better condition based on what you say. I give m and say my dream item is a fury so I need another m. I WOULDNT resort to giving him another m when I couldve spent the first m in the GE to begin with. You are basically trusting a guy to buy an item for you when you can already do it. Except for this the guy wont buy the item. My point stands and yours doesnt. The player is being deceitful and he is tricking the victim into believing he can get an item that he never will get. If you honestly say something as stupid as they didnt give enough to reach the reward threshold they didnt get scammed then youre an idiot. Youre part of whats wrong with this game. This game used to have a great community willing to help each other out and now when someone gets scammed its you didnt get scammed you just didnt give him enough money to reach the threshold.

The reason OSRS has such a compelling vibrance and liveliness to it is because so many of the NPCs have their own goals relationships and personalities that are extrapolated upon in over one hundred quests. The quest system is OSRS is the world of OSRS. Without our quests the world would be lifeless like it is in Zeah. It is of the utmost importance to the feel of the game that many more quests are added than are being put out. Even smaller bitesized ones would help massively.Quests are what give towns their character and personality. Without them we get Zeah.,2007scape,dez6l1z,5,t5_2wbww

11185578,0,t3_5zna7a,the OSRS lore is already different it was the moment they added zeah. It was made certain when they added MM quest. It was done when new locations were added or new NPCs. Items monsters and everything between made OSRS different and I honestly dont care.I personally love some of the lore in Runescape proper its why I played it for as long as I did. However I must admit I thought the whole lets kill guthix thing was sort of really stupid but even then it isnt like there werent great new updates all the time with new lore related content.I think everything OSRS devs bring up the conflit its just an excuse to not make a quest because they dont want to live up to the standard of writing a good lore building story. That is what is the key a fun story with a witty or at times stupid but endearing adventurer.You can get bored of runescape pretty fast and just adding more items and areas and activities wont fix things for people long term. There is no connection to new content and we all know that patching it up with proper quests to explain what the place is and why it is there and why it is important.,2007scape,dezvevb,0,t5_2wbww

11233780,0,t1_df5b7t8,Merching is basically trial and error. No one discloses their good items that make the biggest gains.Im not a big fan of merching because Im generally not by the ge but when I did start Id watch flipping series instead of straight up guides the items they show still wont be the best but most guides simply say to use most traded items whereas those will diversify what they buy a little more and are generally higher returns. However top  most traded items can make money and are generally less risk. But my tip is just dont put your money all in one place if you invest in four items and one loses you money you can still make it up with the other three. Theres definitely more out there but I could make about k an hour with m which is the highest Id ever dedicated to merching.,2007scape,df5c0t5,1,t5_2wbww

11255991,0,t1_df7nyh5,Id love for there to be minigames to make people happy...but there ARE minigames. You are free to play them. Theyre not populated though because there arent enough people that feel the same way as you in regards to wanting to have some fun. I dont mean that in quotes as sarcasm I just mean that the people that grind in Runescape enjoy it and that leads to wanting to be efficient at it for more progress. They wont play the mini games because they arent efficient. If there were a bunch of people that enjoyed the various mini games even if they had no rewards they would be populated but you guys are a minority. The OSRS team is so small it doesnt make sense as a business to expand on mini games when the majority of the population of the game wont play it.Like I said Im not against what you are saying but being older and having time being valuable to you is a valid argument for promini games and progrinding. We all work all day and want to do whatever we want in our free time. Unfortunately for the OSRS players that enjoy mini games theyre in a minority which is why they dont get support in polls.,2007scape,df7ulew,3,t5_2wbww

Similar to no prayer firecapes Jagex didnt think players would be capable of being able to do a large raid with a few people and not die. Death in a raid being based on  points means a death is extremely harsh when doing this. Thats how Jagex dissuaded people from doing this on day  and they didnt expect players would be skillful enough to coordinate a team to dodge attacks at Olm.,2007scape,df7yg5y,1,t5_2wbww

I just assumed that they give preference to people in their region UK since they could reliably travel and at their own expense.They should really fly out people who are getting top killcounts during past tournaments and have them commentateplay at the event or people otherwise knowledgeable in pvp not these hacks that are being propped up.

11354047,0,t1_dfixkrb,The point of doing that is because people are going to immediately compare how long they take to get to in relation to how long they currently take to reach in Nieves cave. If you were to put the metal dragon spot right at the end of Brimhaven dunge by the current IronsSteels people will immediately deem it too far to be viable for use. Same to a lesser extent for the Taverley ones. If you put it with the current bluesblacks then you add on an extra agility req that technically didnt exist before for the Nieve variants or make it take considerably longer to get to. I cant see that going down as well.Bear in mind these new spots would still be slayerexclusive locations. If you wanted to kill metals or bluesblacks off task youd still have to use the existing ones you listed. At the end of the day its all a balancing act making them fit in proper locations while not pissing off players too much by asking them to trek around for excessive periods of time. ,2007scape,dfiyksi,6,t5_2wbww

Each one of those required figuring out where to dig and when you found and dug at the right spots you got a piece or two of the Clue Hunter Outfit which is the main prize. But the last part of the outfit is the Helm of Raedwald and in order to find that you need to use the previous  clues and put them together presumably overlap the maps at the least. And the first person to figure out what the combined clues require you to do in addition to having that satisfaction will get something from Jagex because Jagex said theyre going to put that persons name in the game forever in  or  ways like maybe under the helms examine text itll have the person who found its name.,2007scape,dfr04ap,1,t5_2wbww

Getting  ranged to equip karils andor black dhide is important for melee as well though so you want to eventually get that.I got a lot of range levels from ranging my bloodveld tasks in catacomb kourens for a bit they have extremey low defence and with slayer helmeti you tear through them.Now I got to  combat or so I dont really range a single slayer task anymore though so I dont feel like its that useful past . Another option is to just start using cannon to speed up slayer get to the profit slayer stage more quickly at your current stage you pretty much make almost no profit doing slayer because all the tasks you get are horrible.

11455656,0,t3_63i6lh,having his to walk everywhere until you have enough Herblore to make energy pots yes Im talking ironman but still having to carry  inv slots to be able to run There are plenty of teleports and transportation methods such as charter ships minigame teleports etc. There are more that can be unlocked or used through questing leveling obtaining items such as enchanted jewelery treasure trail teleports or completing achievement diaries. There are incentive to obtain these items and they have value for that reason. Also players who choose to play ironmen are aware of this and choose to limit themselves in this capacity.serpentine helm hitting s or some insanely high thing compared to poison It also degrades as you mentioned you might have to risk it to use it but also we have defense against this. It also takes quite a bit of time for the higher hints to take effect. Typically combat doesnt last that long. In PvP situations we have a defense against this especially when we can clearly see our opponent using it.Slayer dungeon that has literally everything This is likely being changed as per the currently active and passing poll.No instances boss fights in most places makes no sense since all it does is make you hop maybe to a lower population world decreasing spawn rate It creates competition over resources and encouragement to train. Also OSRS spawn rates are not population based but the same for each world.Things like the bludgeon spec barely used... The bludgeon is also the BiS for training strength. Not every item needs to have an amazing or even useful special attack in every scenario. It can be useful in niche situations.Twisted bow the only way to speed run fight caves some raids bosses dks and whatnot It isnt the only way but having one of the most rare and expensive items in the game should make it fast? There are other options at lower price points.Same with blow pipe it is op for the cost it has range dps through the roof especially with the new prayersBlowpipe has a low cost but a high operating cost. If you want the best DPS you have to use the expensive darts which increase costs. The new prayers are also endgame content locked behind an expensive pay wall. The average user cannot afford these.The XP rates are too low for no reason before you go easyscape rs got to those XP rates by ... but osrs is literally avoiding doing that at all. Adding the spec to the hatchetpickharpoon increases XP rates granted but its been so long and many skills still have the same XP rates as when osrs first launched Thats exactly the point. Many are playing OSRS because we dont like what RS turned into. Its a completely different game than the one we originally enjoyed. Why would we go down the same exact path that led us to the content we dont enjoy in the first place? ,2007scape,dfuho08,2,t5_2wbww

We dont know if your telling the truth or not so therefore you are accusing. and for the latter no we would not want to name names during things like these. It can lead to witch hunts harassment or other things that could end badly. share what happened and allow us to know the scam... not the scammer. its also one of the rules. This is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing. Report abuse in game and contact Jagex for serious issues. Feel like sharing?

Realisticlly these skills require alot of time to get  in and your time in game could be spent better else where. Maybe a better solution is to give you off task killing of the creature once you reach a certain kill count on the specific boss. You could have a feature that allows you to prove to the slayer master you can handle it now. I think being limited to  or  bosses with this is important though. ,2007scape,dg2v3ti,-1,t5_2wbww

The fact that the team is hesitant to give buyable skills any pets due to the nature of training them I feel like todt activies would be the perfect way to do so without people crying about devauling exp and stuff like that. The exp can be bad but people will still do them for the pet and maybe a little bit of gp per hr. ,2007scape,dg6h3xf,0,t5_2wbww
11561321,0,t1_dg685n9,Thats just how it was at the time of slayer being released and rune being top notch. It will be weird getting granite before rune but thats just how it goes. Rune should be way lower than  but that is something we cant change now. So we shouldnt use rune boots at  as a basis of future drops.

Which is for the most part literally just click and wait. Congrats on your  TV watching because thats what you really got lets be honest. Theres a difference between hard and slow. And even if someone else does a higher input method like granite at the end of it all you both still just have a number on a screen. One person just missed out on a lot more youtube videos for their extra XP per hour.    This isnt to say its wrong to want a  by all means have goals I myself am aiming for  crafting but its because I like it and it was a big part of my experience early in OSRS so it has personal value to me. So sure get a  just dont make the mistake of telling yourself its any kind of achievement.

So she brings it back out made properly and I say Doesnt this also come with fries? and she asks me Oh I thought with ketchup only you meant you want no fries also.

If you made the reward too late game it would be past the point for some players and the earlier the better so more can benefit from it.

Its a good idea but they need to look at the data and favorability within the gamecommunity and tweak how theyll do it.. Its a fresh idea that has little in the way of actually getting implemented at this moment even though it might have some merit. Typing up their responses I just put in whether they were positive or negative about the idea. Some of the suggestions they say they can but it usually takes a while to get to as there are a lot they want to get done but have limited dev time. Most of the suggestions find their way into polls or just fixedimplemented without needing one.,2007scape,dgj2kx8,17,t5_2wbww

I think void is fine for you to use because your defense level is low.  I personally dont use void because I find it not worth it because I dont use all three combat styles and the def bonus is low.  I use trident and melee.  I use barely any food or prayer pots so I keep a lot in my inventory for properly swapping.  I basically take two complete sets.Its hard to give concrete advice because everyone is at different stages in their combat stats so what works for me wont necessarily work for you on a newer account.,2007scape,dgqz8gt,2,t5_2wbww

Basiclly similar to twisted bow. Other than that if the attack speed is same as a tent as op suggests if you only manipulate its stats its either gonna be better than tent everywhere or worse everywhere. The other option aside from adding a special effect is to make it slow but hard hitting. For that to be better dps against high lvl def than a tent it would have to have very high stats which would just completely wreck the elder maul whichs been in game for  months,2007scape,dgrqape,1,t5_2wbww

11782943,0,t3_683aqn,gt This just goes to show that people dont always know whats best for the game and that the poll system is not perfect.Not sure if I agree with that. More so I dont think this is the best example of that because it did pass which kinda shows the polling system does work more than it is flawed. I do agree it is not perfect but I think failing by less than  is a better example than passing by .As for the not knowing what is best for the game even the most knowledgeable players cant predict the future and know how popular or bad some updates will be. For example a lot of players who voted to remove randoms had no idea it would lead to splashing even if you could have connected the dots there. Likewise some updates seem like something minor or filler but turn out to be great updates.,2007scape,dgvmv11,1,t5_2wbww

11794491,0,t1_dgwm0he,Prior to Fossil Island alot of the content being released was geared towards high levelmaxed players. The community is constantly asking for high level content and we are getting it Raids Zulrah Cerb Bossing in general achievement diary rewards. So I think you can understand why players want it to be easier to gain levels they feel as though the game doesnt really get interesting until they get to the high level content and why would they want to wait thousands of hours to get to raids? Of course these people will ask for and vote in anything that allows them to get to the level  content easierfaster.,2007scape,dgwy1o8,42,t5_2wbww
