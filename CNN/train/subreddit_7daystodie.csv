1819145,0,t3_2fe0ob,How does Rust compare to DD? Well here is my opinion. D is the best zombie survival  crafting  building game available.. Rust is a disappointment.In some aspects DD is unique. Lets take a closer lookBuilding is way better in DD. In Rust you kill red animals they drop metal doors you research them and then produce  metal doors to build a house completely of doors while others collect tons of C to blow up your building while you are offline.In DD you have infinitely more freedom for building because its voxelbased. You can dig a mine. You can fortify an existing building. You can build a small shack or a large fortress or a palace or a bunker almost no limits there.As a gamer who loves the survival genre I appreciate being able to make hidden stashes and bases cover entrances with soil and camouflage them using grass. You cannot do that in Rust. The best option is making a small leather sack and dropping it behind a stone.You can repair and even upgrade blocks in DD. You can reinforce a wooden door with metal or upgrade cobblestone.Zombies  there are none in Rust. DD has zombies they pose a real threat and they become better and better with updates.Crafting  unlike Rust DD offers an interesting system not oversimplified. It reminds me Minecraft sometimes. Although I would like if crafting required proper tools and facilities not just a window.World  in DD you play in an infinite randomly generated world that includes different biomes. You have snowy forests deserts green forests plains burnt forests wastelands even destroyed cities. You can enter every room in every building which makes urban combat really interesting.DD has learned some things from Rust. Mineable stones and airdrops. They are really great.Some gameplay mechanics like stealth amp smell are unique. Zombies can sense you if you carry fresh meat.Updates  I dont remember a single update for Rust. DD gets updated systematically. there were major updates like smooth terrain random gen maps claim blocks.,7daystodie,ck8e4ay,3,t5_2xdtu

Even since the time of this post we have added  bedrooms extended the tunnel some more and created sandbag walls to bolster defenses as the zombies scale. We are going more for a stealth strategy where we are too deep to be discovered at night. At least for now. ,7daystodie,ck92p5d,1,t5_2xdtu

Thats why I built that funnel at the end of my base. I load up on Goldenrod Tea and train them and once theyre bottlenecked I use my shotgun for the most damage. You can read more about the Feral Nights on the developers blog on Tumblr.The post to read more about the Feral Hordes is here Here is what you will want to read Feral Night HordesAdded feral night hordes. Once per week zombies get really hungry and become feral. These feral night hordes can sense players and will find them regardless of how well they are hiding. Every week the horde grows in numbers until the th week.This is just the first version of feral night hordes but we plan on adjusting their numbers based on how well the player is doing down the road. Also once we get the regional soundnoisesmell system working this will determine where the hordes end up going.

SpaceMedieval Engineers have a lot more interactions going on under the hood.I suspect that these sorts of games are only now really becoming possible because we have to much CPU power availiable.  Yeah Minecraft has low overhead but look how much less it does .. . blocks just hang in the air.  Get enough redstone going and youre suddenly bogged down as well.Im kinda waiting on someone to implement a gameboy emulator in redstone in Minecraft . . . then youll have a game played on a CPU emulated in a game MC running on a bytecode engine java running on top of an OS windowswhatever running on a real CPU.

3337912,0,t3_2ybyyo,Ive got  hrs of DD and  hrs of HZ played. I prefer DD overall. I played H after D because a friend bought it for me so I could play it with him. We played on a PVP server and I played on PVE when he wasnt around to learn about the game. A few days on a PVE server is about all you need on H. By then you can pretty much accomplish everything you may want to because youre very limited on what you can do and there are hardly any obstacles no PVP zombies are a joke. After that youre just collecting stuff for the sake of having more stuff. PVP for us at least is just frustrating. SO many hackers in H. So many. Besides that its virtually pointless to try to establish a base because people will just come along and destroy it  use furnaces or decks to get into it while youre offline. Also if youre not playing in a group then you tend to get shit on by those who are. The game is almost  KOS. You may as well just play Battle Royale at that point which admittedly is fun. D on the other hand is a lot more like Minecraft. Single player  PVE can also get pretty boring. Eventually you get a base set up to where you dont have to worry about zombies. While on the topic the zombie are more of a challenge in D. There are various types including a cop that spits acid and explodes theyll break structures to get to you and every th day they show up in large dangerous hordes. If you want to be creative this game is hands down better than H. Eventually my friends and I got bored of PVE and decided to start over as PVP server set up and settings are very similar to how Minecraft is. This definitely added to the game. There are tons of various settings and rules for PVP servers you can explore but we just made it so you had to be so close to center city coords . Unfortunately they all stopped played when I started killing them. I was just looking into some alternate servers when I started playing H but now that Im done with that I might give a large PVP MP server another go. Side note I ended up getting D for  over at rsteamgameswap. ,7daystodie,cp8qx23,3,t5_2xdtu

Wastelands have a better chance for highervalue loot but are deathtraps if youre not careful. Suburbs are fairly safe if you make sure to clear the area and any spider zombies but its more likely you wont find any tools and few bookshelves.The main problem is that once you have a base and your books... what is your goal? Its the same problem I have in minecraft. Once I set up a house and farm make a place for a nether portal make a mine and a mob farm... then what? Then its pretty much just filling up storage boxes so I can go look I have two double chests full of diamonds!Id like to see some valuable pieces of loot  like beakers for example  that you can ONLY find on zombies. What if metal screws were something you could ONLY get off of spider zombies and you couldnt put together or repair any machine without them?

Youll get used to the different way of gearing up but you end up with the same state of gear you had before with the same ensemble of weapons and tools with the same kind of bases that easily defeat the zombies.The big game changers will be weather and weather survival npcs electricity vehicles and the ability to make custom maps.  Then things could get interesting.,7daystodie,cq8q6zq,1,t5_2xdtu

Also lots of talkaround about most efficient fuel to use for the reason to deal with the healnmap.Pieced together but general gist is..every item you put in as fuel in a forgefire adds heat...thus the less items put in to get the cook time..the less heat you generate.Fpr my group we only use coal ore or wood logs depending on what burn time is needed. Totally ocd but it helps...to a point. If I run two forges each melting a stack of gravel...spiders are a guarantee.  Its a callout point for us.

5293542,0,t3_3ni0kp,Good info. I didnt know about the gravel trick from the roads. Some more tips. If you are low on ammo and pick up a whole gun of poor quality dont throw it away. Put it in the deconstruct window and a full mag worth of ammo will be put into your inventory.. Always have some for of bandage on your hotbar  or  for quick access to stop bleeding. Early game cloth can be gained from knocking down curtains in houses.. The shiny brass fixtures in houses are actually brass. Knock down lights on the ceiling and outside walls for quick scrap for ammo.. Grain alcohol is better than beer for replenishing stamina. Beer requires you to have a partially depleted hydration bar to drink. Alcohol can be chugged infinitely but dont drink more than  or you start getting negative effects.. Chug bear stew to get wellness up to  quickly. If you are at full hydration take a painkiller as they deplete hydration then alternate again with the stew until you hit the wellness you want.. Always carry a large stack of frames or logs to make frames for those times you are stuck in a hole with a broken leg. Also cloth to make crutches among other things.. If you find goggles you can wear them with your helmet to increase your damage resistance percentage. Simply put on your helmet first followed by the glasses might be other way around.,7daystodie,cvob87l,3,t5_2xdtu

Probably named road signs would be too difficult but they could always artistically have part of the sign destroyed where the name would be. For the amount of time every player spends on roads they are incredibly dull repetitive and uninteresting. The devs should be looking at areas where people spend the most time and try to come up with ways to make them more interesting roads are one of these things IMO. ,7daystodie,cvpzcy1,5,t5_2xdtu

5640894,0,t3_3sbrao,I agree that the more options for customizing their speeds and when they runwalk would help keep the game more interesting for some players. Im fine with the default or even alwayswalking settings. I typically pick a path between being overly cautious and going headtohead against the zombies not herding and redirecting them. Usually its because Im still leveling and need the XP and prefer to give myself the challenge of dispatching them on first contact. I will run out of the building if things are about to get too hairy but I dont always run out and I will not hesitate to fight in the middle of a shambling group of them.I agree that the AI needs a lot of improvement and variations among the different types but I have faith that this is in the works.Back when The Walking Reddits server was hosted by Archie the guy that created the FrontRunnerTek dtd server manager they had created variations of the existing zombies and made them shamble faster than the defaults. So there was a mix of the standard shambling zombies and then the copied versions that shambled at .x speed or something like that. I couldnt tell you how it was done but Im sure its all in the xml files and doesnt require any hardcore injection of code.I know I know... editing the xmls to your preference isnt what youre looking for. You want hardcoded menu options that you dont have to reprogram with every release. I agree but for the time being it could work.,7daystodie,cwwb2em,1,t5_2xdtu

DO NOT AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHT gt this will cause your character to slow down and get ya killed gt you MUST hipfire practise makes good. spikes. always have wood on you andor wood spikes small ones while running in reverse spam those spikes down in zigzags. watch em trip whine n die I hope this helps you out !  happy gaming !,7daystodie,cyy0677,2,t5_2xdtu

I strongly feel that bandits are going to change the game for the worse. Currently the game for all its flaws is about the zombie apocalypse. With these ridiculous hypercliche bandits like cringeworthy cliche DD becomes just a generic grabbag of apocalypse tropes. Worse the bandits are going to take over the game Where formerly we designed our bases to protect against zombies now we build them to defend against bandits and zombies become an afterthought. May as well just remove them from the game entirely.

8673323,0,t3_4yqykp,Morjaxs guide on Steam is pretty good and most all the techniques would apply to consoles.Only two things to really add to his guideTool Smithing  beyond like level  rather than grinding stone axes watch anvils being made in the forge. Just be sure to watch the forge queue so you dont miss it.Pro tip you can fill up the forge output with like  wood.  in each square. Then when ever you come back to the forge the Anvil with drop into your back pack. So you dont need to watch the queue and youll still get tool smithing points. Drop the new anvils back into the forge to be melted down and reforged again.So the best way to save yourself time and resources would be to block out the queue of a spare forge or four. Queue up  anvils in each one. Then everytime you walk by the four forges you peek in each. An anvil would drop into your pack which youd just put right back into the forge to be melted down. Then add just enough fuel to the forge to make or melt down one anvil whichever takes the most time. Do that for all four forges then continue on your way.Science  Start a mine in the desert biome and mine shale. Then watch shale cook down to gasoline in a campfire. You can go    science in lt minutes just watching the queue.egnrish be hard,7daystodie,d6pscn3,11,t5_2xdtu

When it became clear to me that the game was not fun for me that way even though it was a successful tactic I started a new game with the intention of learning to defend an aboveground base. The game became much more fun.Move down a few levels. Or move back to your previous fort. Or try building a new fort from scratch. Clearly hanging out on top of a skyscraper is a tactic that makes the game easy for you to the point that its no longer fun. So dont hang out on top of a skyscraper.

They are trying to optimize it better now so I cant see anything major making its way to console until at least after the current version is a welloiled mini bike.

9260069,0,t3_5783sc,The game difficulty varies hard depending on one main thingThe standards you set yourself.If your standard for surviving is managing to hold down a comfortable base above ground without it breaking down especially if its not a prefab the game is a lot harder.On the other hand you can easily get by the first two hordes by letting a horde smash a brick prefab while you just wait patiently for the night to pass on top ESPECIALLY if youre on  minute days.You could even go full cheese and dig underground for the hordes.Ultimately if youre struggling with the difficulty I would avoid making your own comfy base in single player  that gets a lot easier if you have a friend or two to help you gather resources. If youre solo playing just dont get too attached to the things you stand on and let them get destroyed then move on to the next place.If what youre saying is true and youre literally not finding any prefabs in the first day of your random gen then maybe you should start looking for roads and follow them.,7daystodie,d8ps47u,4,t5_2xdtu

Stone has a max load of  and a mass of  so you can go  out from a support before it collapses. Now times that by  and you have your safe distance wall to wall. Of course thats getting a bit close to the max load so thinner is better. Ive made rooms in the x range and theyll collapse but not all the way to the surface. Those were started at bedrock also. Remember the amount of gravel in the area matters as well because gravel has a very weak max load and will collapse very easy. My tunnels are usually x and can go for as far as I want with no worry of collapse. I always dig to bedrock and tunnel from there. ,7daystodie,deat96z,2,t5_2xdtu

But I think this overreaction is the wrong move. People arent going to be clamoring to buy a twoyearold PS game because they finally added features that make the game worth the  theyre inexplicably trying to sell it for.They should either prioritize adding features to the console version or stop working on the console version altogether if as it appears the console port was just a badfaith money grab.Focusing entirely on fixing bugs will not help them move more copies of the game on console.
