6996744,0,t1_d19er6s,Im not really familiar with Carplay but the oem Entune unit used to read my text messages. When I had an Android phone it even let you send a preprogrammed repomse. I would always respond to my friends Youre the best! no matter what they said so they knew I was driving haha. Anyway I doubt Toyota would install your stereo but my point is if you replace the HU and speakers thats all you would be voiding the warranty on. If you blow an aftermarket speaker youre not gonna expect Toyota to fix it anyway. Not to mention all products you buy will still have a manufacturers warranty if they crap out prematurely. The only pain in the ass thing is wiring the speakers but if youre not gonna do it yourself its probably another couple hundred bucks in labor. If a reputable shop does the work they should stand behind it and help you with any issues. The only problem you might run into is unless you pay their prices for all your components they will likely try to shy away from warrantying their work because they cant vouch for the components you supplied them. I think your best bet would be to try and get them to price match prices you find on Amazon or Crutchfield and buy it all through them  the install. ,4Runner,d19fa6h,2,t5_2vdiz

7759496,0,t3_4l2idv,I dont know much about the nd gen runners but it sounds like the driveshaft slip yolk or maybe a u joint. After coming to a stop do you feel the clunk right after letting your foot off the brake? The driveshaft is like a strut and goes in and out to compensate for the rear end traveling up and down. When you come to a stop and the weight shifts to the front a bad drive shaft or poorly greased driveshaft will then get stuck. As you let your foot off the brake and shift weight back again it will pop out resulting in the clunk. In the th gens there is a grease zerk and it usually is fixed easily by greasing the driveshaft and u joints. Hope that helps.Edit wording,4Runner,d3o7121,1,t5_2vdiz

9947513,0,t1_daw27rk,Ok updateIve noticed a few things that I can comment on.  First the fulltime wheel drive of the Rover was nice in that I didnt need to think about shifting into wd ever.  Only had to lock the center diff when it was necessary.  The Runner drives in WD most of the time which means I need to shift into H when I want to back out of my rather steep driveway.  Otherwise I get wheel spin.  Ceiling seems lower in the Runner.  Im not super tall  but when wearing a ball cap the top of the hat hits the headliner.  This didnt occur in the Discovery.  Speaking of ergonomics window sill seems too high and arm rest seems too low compared to the Discovery.  These are minor annoyances and Im sure Ill get used to them.The Runner is much quieter than my Rover.The Discovery had more pep... when I pushed down the gas pedal there wasnt any hesitation.  Runner has maybe a second of hesitation before it takes off.  Rover V had less horsepower and torque but the torque on the Rover was lowend torque peaking at around rpm.  Runner torque curve peaks at like rpm.  Lowend torque is better for offroading.Rover had higher towing capacity I think.  Rover was rated to tow lbs without brakes on the trailer and  with brakes.  Runner is rated at lbs but doesnt mention if thats with or without brakes.Thats what I can think of right now... I may update again after Ive had more time driving on and offroad.  Vehicle has about  miles on it as of this post.,4Runner,db46psb,1,t5_2vdiz

10034872,0,t3_5jcvgj,Hello there fellow potentialrdgenRunnerowneronOahu! Have a  rd gen here. There could be dozens of us haha. Anyway there are tons and tons of rd gens on this island and for good reason  theyre great trucks! The th gens are too big and goofy looking for my liking esp the dash and controls the rd gen is more truck like if thats what youre into. The only reason Id be hesitant on that particular truck is because of all the modifications it has. Could mean the owner was enthusiastic and took care of it well or it was driven hard. These are stout trucks and the A trans is pretty hardy but k with the added wear from a supercharger would have me take a close look at the condition of the trans fluid and shift quality. The common failures with these trucks are pretty basic and easily remedied. Around k the lower balls joints are known to fail sometimes catastrophically. Replace with OEM parts for another k. Affordable esp if you do it yourself. About the same mileage automatic trucks tend to experience internal failure of the transmission cooler in the radiator which leaks coolant into the trans fluid. This results in a slipping trans and trans fluid that resembles a pink milkshake. Easy enough replace the radiator a Denso manufacturer for many Toyota parts is available. At the same time its a good idea to replace the hoses go OEM only two hoses and flush the coolant Toyota Red long life coolant. Do these and you should bypass all the known common failures. Obviously youll want to catch up on any other maintenance differential fluid fuel filter etc but these can be done yourself with some basic tools as time permits say one or two of them a weekend.,4Runner,dbfkjkr,1,t5_2vdiz

10191209,0,t3_5lx7f5,I will try to answer the best I can as I just recently picked up a Trail. . I did not get the Trail premium as the price didnt justify the options i didnt really need. It adds turn signals on the mirrors power moon roof softex seats heated front seats home link receiver auto dimming mirror Entune premium with built in navigation and apps instead of the Scout GPS connected. Mine came with the Entune premium. I didnt need the other stuff. Im about your height no issues.. They both run a R. The Trail rims are wider at . inches with a mm offset. While the TRD Pro rims are . inches with a mm offset. So the TRD rims will stick out a bit. You may have some rubbing buy reading some forums seems like you wont have issues unless you increase your tire size.. I cant answer this. I think there was some law where they have to prove that the modification was what caused the issue to not cover warranty but dont quote me on that.. I know a lot of people like to switch to LED interior lights. As far as other mods first thing I did was get some all terrains. Toyota didnt do the Trail oriented vehicle justice by putting all seasons on it. Best of luck!,4Runner,dbz8aqt,3,t5_2vdiz

10789634,0,t3_5u3tz4,Burn gas while filling it. Makes perfect sense. In all honesty. Its not advised to do that for many reasons. Do you want to mess up your runner? Cuz thats a good way to start. Now if you had charging issues and knew by turning it off it wouldnt start again. Then its a reasonable solution. But...if you do it often. Its not safe for your engine. Youre sucking in to much air that the engine is designed to take on. Youre actually conning yourself out of gas. Getting more air than fuel leaving it running. And throwing the pump itself off. Because they are designed to read pressure and prevent overfilling. Honestly just shut it off and leave it on accessory if you want to hear your music while at the pump. Safe for you safe for youre vehicle safe for everyone else at that station. Its not always yourself. All you need is that one asshole to flick his cigarette in your general direction. But youll get blamed for it. Since your vehicle was still running while pumping gas. That farting noise is from your engine running and sucking in air from the fuel filler. Which in turn robs you of fuel since youre fuel is being displaced with air inside the tank. Causing to think Its full when it is not.  Its also bad for your emissions system too.  being that your fuel pump itself relies on fuel pressure to work properly. Youre just making it work harder. And can cause premature failure of your fuel pump too if you make it an often occurrence.Its not all that hard to just shut it off man. Are you in a colder climate? Is that why? To keep it warm while filling?,4Runner,ddsvhrn,3,t5_2vdiz

10821040,0,t3_5upepr,th gen runners definitely feel slower and less responsive than even my v th gen but I honestly dont find it lacking. Its smoother and more linear throttle so not snappy like the v Toyotas are but it still moves along reasonably and safely and the smaller size will be killer for any narrow roads or tight camping spots. We get around mpg on average with our  Limited. Much better than my  v though my th gen has  miles is mildly lifted and on all terrains and has driven through a lb white tail at mph Ultimately Im sure there will be times you miss the power but they have a lot more character than the tundra does so youre changing one interesting feature for another. ,4Runner,ddw445s,2,t5_2vdiz

11039150,0,t3_5xlcan,Most of us camp slightly differently than the next guy so my first piece of advice is to be open to some trial and error. This will help you figure out what mods will help you the best.  Not all of us are taking these rigs out for months on end in super remote places.  But some of us do go out for days on end in semi remote areas so there has to be a middle ground.  Next Id say is get some of those big plastic bins from the hardware store.  I use my  Runner out in the backcountry three weekends a month and Im always doing different kinds of trips. Sometimes we are backpacking so gear is at a minimum and sometimes its a car camping trips and you can bring everything including a kitchen sink.  Sometimes Im out with just my girlfriend and were backpacking so we only really need our packs.  I use the bins to store everything else we are leaving in the truck in a more organized way and the less stuff visible the less likely someone is to go window shopping for some gear... Theyll just go to the next guys car.  I know they could just take the bin but happens less often where Im from than just smash and grabs. Other times the trip has more nuances like a multiday backcountry ski trip where you need lots of gear with you and even more at the trailhead depending on how we are staying the night and how many people are out in the tour.   Most of the ones I have will drop in place on a pull sled and you can skin them right to where we are camping without getting gear covered in snow or missing some when the sled ultimately tips over.  So having some modularity is great.  The bins keep gear dry clean and organized.  When we get to where were going. I just open the back and pull out all the bins and everyone gets to making final adjustments.  Noone is left with gear scattered about getting lost or getting damaged because its unseen and being crushed by something else.   Drawer systems are great but hard to take in and out and cost .  When I dont want the bins I just take them out and stack them in the basement.  When we are all headed out in the next adventure we assess what we need and have multiples of several sized bins  up to  gallon tubs to choose from and pack according to the trips needs.  Enjoy figuring out what works for you. ,4Runner,dej9o0e,3,t5_2vdiz
