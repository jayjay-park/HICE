2963461,0,t1_co4v65r,Well you can see where its tied  and it comes from the main harness but thats all I know,944,co4yl83,0,t5_2v9r3
4487160,0,t3_3chrxl,Yeah Id see it going at that price if it were manual.I would definitely have enjoyed picking my my NA at that price.  Seems like the majority of s and s for sale are midAtlantic area.  So there might be a bit of a saturated market there.  In Colorado prices are much higher. But not for automatics sorry.,944,csw9pat,1,t5_2v9r3
5182275,0,t1_cvabc78,It looks like the car might have originally been black?  If it was repainted they did a good job.,944,cvanjuv,2,t5_2v9r3
5221042,0,t1_cvf9p1c,Will absolutely do.  What was your experience? ,944,cvfbsm0,1,t5_2v9r3
5332880,0,t1_cvt9rhe,Yeah a piece of wire is right thing to do you can also try grounding all of the pins at the same time i would get out your multimeter and test continuity between pin  and the frame and i dont think its the sensor in my experience when the sensor goes bad the fans actually stay on. ,944,cvtc2eu,1,t5_2v9r3
5569705,0,t1_cwn3fjh,I couldnt hear the fuel pump either. So following Clark garage manual I shorted the DME relay and could start the car. It catches on but runs very rough like its misfiring. Im gonna try some fuel injector cleaner.,944,cwnh1es,1,t5_2v9r3
6249967,0,t1_cz008mx,In my cars defense. I put k miles on it in  years and this is the first time I have had something truly break. ,944,cz01yao,2,t5_2v9r3
7949310,0,t1_d49ck5e,Yeah I was trying to get the contact piece on a fresh piece of the resistor pad. Just one of a million things Ive tried to fix it currently I have the injectors out to clean them ,944,d49kszf,1,t5_2v9r3
8313257,0,t3_4te5wy,Incredible... Makes me want to purchase one even more. Still having to save money for that diamond in the rough car though. ,944,d5gppce,1,t5_2v9r3
8459695,0,t1_d5y5a7y,Thank you for the advice. I figured id just fix each issueproblem as it comes up and fine tune it over time,944,d5yzwcp,1,t5_2v9r3
8513601,0,t3_4w0vcs,nvisible keep us posted.  I have similar issues with my s power steering so Im very curious to hear what this turns out to be.  Thanks!,944,d65rb0y,2,t5_2v9r3
8515977,0,t3_4wbx60,You said its a little large. Would shortening it help? I got a replacement for my z that wasnt perfect and bent. I ended up cutting one end a bit and it fit in perfect.,944,d6621hz,2,t5_2v9r3
8902065,0,t1_d7h8ced,Its not just propped up on that tire?,944,d7hwf5c,2,t5_2v9r3
9314777,0,t1_d8wdsog,Pro tip on the s all the body panels were galvanized at the factory prior to painting so rust free isnt as unusual as you would otherwise think for a  year old car. If you find a rusting  run away. Also the underbody coating was substantial and has held up well overall across the model so again rust problems are definite deal breakers in almost any circumstances imho.,944,d8wptaq,1,t5_2v9r3
9960024,0,t1_db5s96i,Gotcha. Thanks!,944,db5tf79,1,t5_2v9r3
9966586,0,t3_5i746m,How much is inexpensive?Pelican seems to have fittedish cotton cloth covers for about . Seems kind of pricey for a temporary solution. Big box stores should have generic seat covers for pretty cheap.,944,db6o7pg,2,t5_2v9r3
10045141,0,t1_dbgcadc,I would just top it up with new fuel. When you leave a car put non ethanol fuel in so it doesnt break down so much,944,dbgwool,2,t5_2v9r3
10244790,0,t1_dc5alo8,Part of my hope comes from guides like that.  This community has amassed such amazing resources for this car it seems surprisingly approachable.I also do understand it can be a bit of a hellcar but its also so well documented that at least taking my shot seems like the right move.Thanks for the link!  Ill go down the list while I check it out!,944,dc5ay7k,2,t5_2v9r3
10436557,0,t1_dcqr82u,I think it all depends on where you live when I did the clutch in my  a car that started life in Florida and is still in Florida. I had no issues removing anything other then about  hours or time getting it completed.,944,dcr1y6y,1,t5_2v9r3
10462038,0,t1_dctycte,Yeah I do see what you are saying but these things have definitely seen better days. Ive flogged the car myself for the last  ks. Who knows what the previous two owners did to it? It looks to me as though someone has had a very minor crash  like hitting a curb or gutter or something with reasonable force. Although the tyres are not wearing unevenly.One unit has had the mounting point for the ABS wire ripped off and its ever so slightly buckled almost imperceptible where it bolts to the wishbone.,944,dctz8iu,1,t5_2v9r3
10515192,0,t1_dczvi6d,It is easier to go through the bottom. Top is possible but you need to remove some parts to come out the top.,944,dd00cu4,2,t5_2v9r3
10705080,0,t1_ddk3dmf,Of course turbo cars need all that. They exceed  psi. Are you using the stock boost gauge?,944,ddk5dw7,1,t5_2v9r3
10995154,0,t1_dee2ra4,Very nice and I agree since my car is track only in its application. Would be interested in the story of the swap pics etc.,944,dee9lmt,1,t5_2v9r3
11211318,0,t3_5yng9y,Great I will check them out. Thanks!,944,df2sged,1,t5_2v9r3
11554653,0,t1_dg5itk9,Ive already got one like this Will that work? ,944,dg5q2cp,1,t5_2v9r3
