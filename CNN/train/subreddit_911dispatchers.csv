Do something to relieve any stress. Next it is a job. Sure it might be the greatest job in the world. It may be the job you have wanted forever. But in the end it is just a job. The world will keep on spinning regardless of your position. I believe you may be adding stress to yourself about your performance. Most likely leading you to over think and that is likely assisting with poor performance. Take a deep breath relax. Listen to the feed back you are given. It is great to hear you are actively replaying your previous calls. That is awesome but try not to spend too much time dwelling on the past. Be yourself know your limitations and try not to worry to much about the stuff out of your control. When it comes to addresses locations and other details. Remember these are all important to the responding units. When you take the calls try to invision you or someone you care about parent spouse sibling etc is going on that call and you need to get them there safe and to do there job.Be safe stay hydrated keep your wits breathe and try not to worry too much.
