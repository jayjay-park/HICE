9196177,0,t1_d8g4t13,Indeed. I love this album listened to it for many years but have yet to see the actual film they did the score for. The Nile Song that tune deserves its own post! The HARDESTFloyd tune for true. Main Theme Cirrus Minor Crying Song Cymbaline rank as some of my favorite Floyds songs ever. Nick Mason and Rick Wright RIP standout the most to me. The stretches Rick got into on Quicksilver the bass drum setting the zone for Main Theme with the tick tick broken clock style that Mason is known for...Wright darts organs and different colors throughout the soundscape. Many nights in the studio spinning that one.A mixed bag as you say and thats spot. Soundtrack albums really allow you to see a different level of musicianship because they have to carry out an idea other than their own. They do great in that challenge. Really need to find this movie.,60sMusic,d8holvo,2,t5_2u3i3
