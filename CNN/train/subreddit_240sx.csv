The front end was red because Silvia passenger door was purple because someone painted it with latex paint and a paint brush.  I replaced it due to damage from a failed breakin.

1885416,0,t1_ckgdgai,I definitely dont wish issues on anyone but the bright side is that it is cheap to rebuild. That gives OP the chance to completely go through the bottom end and ensure that nothing else is wrong.     What a lot of people fail to do when they buy cars like this by that I mean a cheap popular RWD platform is take it to a mechanic and get it check out before purchasing. There is a good chance OP could have gotten a compression test done and seen that the rings where on their way out. But its too late for that now. So what OP should do is pick himself up rebuild or replace that engine and start nutampbolting the entire car.

However the quality of the ball joint or rose joint is pretty much the key part here.USA made FK racing piece bearing feature a teflon liner to provide quiet operation lower friction smoother articulation and eliminates bushing deflection under load. The liner is also selflubricating and selfcleaning offering robust reliability for street and track use.basically its the weak point of the whole item and will likely be the first thing to go as with almost any rear camber arm or any suspension arm using a rose  ball joint.I havent seen many broken rear camber arms its not a major stress point like front  rack ends or tie rod ends or knuckles.

Said fenders have always been in very high demand. Not to mention that this USDMgtJDM front end conversion is frequently being performed on cars which are often used in a very destructive motor sport where these parts are CONSTANTLY getting damaged and need to be replaced.These are not Ford Taurus fenders your inquiring about here dude.

3802551,0,t3_33y7gb,Hellofirst off I wanted to say my condolences and glad you are okay we cant replace you but you can always replace your whip. I do understand on what you are going through because your first SX series is technically your baby therefore you are going through a lot of emotions due to the accident which I do understand. I lost my first car which is a S coupe by someone short stopping in front of me and I had no time to stop that my whole front end was totaled but thankfully I am alive till this day. I was going through a lot of emotions towards myself and the accident but its just a car that you can replace which I have been looking on Craigslist for  months looking for another S. On the th month on the last week of the th month I found a very clean stocked neglected  Limited Edition sx Convertible that has been used for years since the married couple are in the marines and always been deployed that they sold the Vert to me for . The body is straight the engine is very clean and well taken care of and never been used because of their deployment but I must say that the interior for verts are hard to maintain which was sorta a  rating when I purchase it but now its a  interior since my father and I fixed it up. So I highly recommend you to have more patience to find a S which would be hard if you really need transportation but if you dont and can take public transportation which Ive done during those  month period then keep looking I know you will find one soon and it just takes time!  Good Luck and stay positive!  PS If you are planning to sell your S I recommend you selling it on Craigslist than ecology since people would only pay you at least  depending on your area and will part your SX but if you created an ad for someone to purchase the SX then he or she would probably fix it up which I actually did. I posted my old Coupe on Craigslist and sold it for  plus I gain a new friend who has been posting updated about the Coupe but I warned you look for someone who is motivated to fix it up than being lazy because Ive gotten people who are interested to purchase my coupe but their GFs told me that they would be lazy and probably sell the car. So just giving you a recommendation if you are selling it. ,240sx,cqppyuc,1,t5_2sqch

Those and the  on the rear hub assembly where the traction and toe arms are connected.Sway bar bushingsend links are already done as they were easy. Same with the steering rack. I still need to do the steering column bushing at the firewall.Subframe Im gonna go with aluminum and put the order in when I order the rear traction rods to replace the one I fucked up and probably install after the event this month. But Im gonna give a go at the toe arms first to see if I can do them without managing to fuck those up too.I found the grease fitting write up on that Nissan road racing forum here for the curious. But Im kind of iffy on if I want to do that or not. Something about drilling and cutting channels and compromising the integrity of the bushing doesnt sit quite right with me. Will the grease dry out that fast? Im not using the grease that comes with the bushings since my friend gave me some high end stuff he has that hes used on all his race cars for years and swears by. At this point the car is pretty much solely a track car that gets driven on the street maybe once a week tofrom work if the weather is nice and it isnt blazing hot out and is garage kept the rest of the time while my WRX endures the elements outside lol and the track time it does see is pretty sparse like once every other month or so and even then I only get to drive half the day since I cant compete yet no cage so I just drive during the practice sessions the first half of the day.,240sx,d0jixij,1,t5_2sqch

8143399,0,t3_4qoe4y,What damage do you see from your bumpers? I cant see any from the picture you provided besides the clear coat. Chassis mounted wings are lame  of the time imo. They will provide some downforce which will vary based on the quality of the wings and the setup of said wing. Too often people go for showy ones that are heavy as fuck and have too much drag.  A ducktail will effectively provide zero downforce.  To really notice a change in downforce at low Autocross speeds a decent body mounted wing canard frontside splitter setup and possibly rear diffuser should be researched. Also get yourself some new wheels if your going widebody. The rears could easily use some mm but the fronts dont really need it right now. Those XXRs are really heavy for a grip setup and look goofy with a huge wing. Also out of curiousity what suspension are you running? And brakes?,240sx,d4vgygc,1,t5_2sqch

10535597,0,t3_5qv5ii,I buy and sell on Zilvia all the time and its nothing too daunting. Just PM whoever you want to buy from and theyll respond. Arrange shipping and ask any questions you want. Ask for theyre PayPal address and send them money with your address. Dont send money as a gift so you get protection from PayPal. Thats pretty much it. Most people are cool on Zilvia but you can check out their seller feedback if youre really concerned.,240sx,dd2br76,2,t5_2sqch

Blocks sight and annoyingly in the way at night. Vents? See above.. Dash? Drill holes in an OEM crackless dash?.. Ok.. Above steering wheel? Blocks gauges. So please tell me what your problem with it is?
