8042239,0,t1_d4atoa4,Probably a copy of C Programming by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie would get you by. There are a far great deal more programming languages today than in the s and I think more complexity due to the layers upon layers of libraries and APIs on there.Just think about the raging debate of the time about structured programming and the GOTO convention. Nobody today would even question modern programming conventions and argue that GOTO is superior its not its sloppy code.Things are just different back then.,80s,d4k0uhx,2,t5_2raga
