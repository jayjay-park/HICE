6182188,0,t3_408onm,The order you apply your paints is important if you want to weather. Heres my process for armour. Undercoat Grey. Preshade Black. Base colours and pick out details. Gloss varnish where decals go. Apply decals.. Chipping. I use a torn up bit of sponge and dab german black brown on edges and corners. Its very easy to go too heavy here so go lightly.. Gloss coat. We want to protect our previous layers.. Wash. I use artists oils thinned right down and wash the whole model. Burnt Umber is a great works with anything colour. Add lamp black to darken it for brown models. The gloss coat will help the wash drain into the corners to create shadows.. Wipe off most of the wash. Leaving it in the resesses. You get nice streaks here if you take your time.a. Nows the time to do dot filters and oil streaks and other liquid weathering techniques.. Matt coat to seal in the wash.. Drybrush the highlights.. Profit.You can see step by step walkthroughs of this process over on my blog ,72scale,cyscmhi,3,t5_37x6t

6772864,0,t1_d0jyg8d,With a lot swearing and frustration. The wings are done with EZ line eight different lines and I now realise that I could of probably done it with just four or if I was doing it again just one. The rigging underneath between the wheels was trial and error a mix of wire and fishing line. The annoying thing is is that the wire looks really good but it just wouldnt stick half the time. The cables for the controls on the tail wings and fin are fishing line it was a real learning curve with the rigging. ,72scale,d0jziq7,1,t5_37x6t

8837480,0,t3_516i9u,Whoops it is hasegawa! Thanks for the comments guys. It actually came with a crew member hence the open hatch and a cavalry soldier but I didnt assemble them yet because I figure Id use them separately for paint practice. If they turn out well Ill put the crew member back on. ,72scale,d7a52ao,2,t5_37x6t
