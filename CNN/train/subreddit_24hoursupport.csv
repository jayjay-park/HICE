Now when installing a bootleg copy of Windows you will need to trick it into thinking that its activated.So using a special program usually called a loader you can trick Windows into thinking that its licensed properly and activated.The loader tools for doing so are often flagged as malware due to their nefarious nature. So you ran the malware scan it picked up the loader tools deleted or quarantined them and now suddenly Windows realized that its not a genuine copy. ,24hoursupport,celnspy,7,t5_2rv00

There is a good guide on sevinforums on how to do that.Im a very out of practice in linux but there is an ntfsg tool you can use to mount your windows partition inside of linux. the SystemRescueCD comes with this utility so maybe the MintLive CD does also.

The clicks you hear are coming from your Hard drive and is the first sign that your hard drive is dying. The clicking is the mechanics of the swing arm on the platters either going or clicking against something in the case. The fact that it does this without the card is not really true it does it ONCE before you boot normally. With the card in place the BIOS is scanning all the hardware since it does not know what changed. Without it all the checksums for original hardware are in place and it does not have to scan new hardware.either way your HDD probably need replacement. If you can boot up backup your data off there and replace the drive asap. or replace the machine as you said its an old machine and may not be worth dumping  a new drive inside.

4396089,0,t3_3baes2,I feel like its worth mentioning that if you reinstall windows but dont format the hard drive which is the default route of the installation all of the files in your current root drive will stick around except for your program files and your windows files. Everything in the User folder such as my documents my downloads my pictures desktop etc will be saved in a folder on the  main drive called windows.old. Even your application preferences are saved in a hidden folder in that User file called AppData  The only thing you lose is your actual installations. You will have to reinstall programs. But as far as backing up your data being a concern it should all stick around for you as long as you dont format the hard drive.But a re installation is the fastest and most comprehensive way to get that likenew speed you are desiring.If you are really hell bent on not reformatting I think your best route is to use the startup tool in CCleaner or type msconfig into the run dialog box and audit which programs and services are starting. I think that generally has one of the biggest impacts on performance barring an infection that your scanners are probably missing.

5914792,0,t3_3wba76,All antivirus suites protect about the same.  Nothing is perfect. BitDefender Kaspersky and Trend are all good AVs. If it was me I would look into more of a managed services platform if you are comfortable handling the IT work which it seems you are. If you dont want to take on the load of the IT work then I would look into a Managed Services Provider MSP in your area. You can look up info about MSPs but basically in a nutshell its an all in one program. So it includes Antivirus and protection suites and it allows yousomeone to monitor the workstations and servers. You can apply updates and patches get reports or emails including any threats the AV found updates applied event viewer errors and a lot more. They also allow you to remotely access the workstations and servers. There are a lot of great MSP platforms but Ive heard great things about MAXFocus which used to be known as GFI. If you dont want to go the full MSP route then I would look into small business based AVs such as Trend Micros Office Scan. This will allow you do setup scheduling of scans and some basic AV monitoring.Finally since they were hit with Cryptowall which is very severe unless there is shadow copies basically no one can recover the data. And if it was Cryptowall . then it erases all shadows you might want to look into CryptoPrevent There is a free version of it but basically it prevents programs from installing in the appdata folders CUsersUserProfileAppData. A lot of Crypto malware installs here so this can help prevent future attacks. There are a couple caveats though. Some legitimate programs do install in AppData. The only ones I know of is some VPNs and some HP Printer software. Now if all the computers are setup and up and running with all the software and programs on them... Then when you install CryptoPrevent it should automatically whitelist any currently installed programs in AppData and allow them to run.  However down the road if someone tries to install a program that was.. To be honest.. Poorly written and executes from AppData then CryptoPrevent will stop it from running. This can easily be fixed and the program can be whitelisted. But its good to keep in mind. Ive never ran into a single issue deploying CryptoPrevent but I have heard of some issues with programs that run from AppData. So if you install it and get a call a year from now for a program that wont install keep it in mind Hopefully this info helps and good luck!,24hoursupport,cxuym97,1,t5_2rv00

As for your Norton verify you are on the latest update by running your live update see the link i posted if you have not already It would not hurt to run these either BEFORE you run your scans make sure you have run disk cleanup and ccleaner to make sure you are not scanning a ton of junk files. Not absolutely necessary but it will speed up your scans because you wont have to scan tons of junk and temp files.

If it is not install it and see if there is a setting functionality that is trying to optimize for a single output ? IN my experience some gpus pout or make it difficult to access some functionalities if you do not have the approved bloatware installed with them. How are your monitors connected? Many excellent GPUs and this one seems pretty nice have very harsh limits as to what they can out put to. Quoting from the site this GPU supports DVI Output  Yes x  Native DVIDHDMI Output  Yes x  Native HDMI .Display Port  Yes x  Native Regular DPHDCP Support  Yes I have had some experiences with less nice hardware though so your mileage may vary  in which using  X HDMI was much better than having  x DVI and  X HDMI but again this is with less nice hardware.  This could be an issue with HD rendering in general. Your new GPU may be attempting to render the twitch youtube we in glorious  P HD and it could be having to adjust the sizeaspect ratio constantly. I would test by forcing the streaming video to lowest possible quality and see if symptoms persist. If not then start amping up to see where you can get the best HD with minimal drag on your gaming experience.  This appears to be designed to function best with the active cooling portion active and in  Us of space. What other PCIe devices are installed? Any? And have you made sure that the gpu is seated properly? Per ARK    this CPU handles   lanes of PCIe traffic only. Are you over? Does the fan portion on the GPU spin up and is heat moving somewhere that the CPU case can dump it?
