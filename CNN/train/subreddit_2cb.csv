10388041,0,t3_5oo7wu,mg. Im sure Im in the minority here. mg is the bit of a body high and fucking giggles and laughing until our faces hurt. That or we get lost in Mario Kart to some playlist that transports our minds to a memory. Thats my sweet spot most the time. ,2cb,dcljsco,6,t5_2xazx
10505805,0,t3_5qfumh,Oral mg capsule. It is just on the tipping point of being a cognitive psychedelic in addition to synesthesia and waves of euphoria.,2cb,dcyy0hm,2,t5_2xazx

11061233,0,t3_5w0k8l,Honestly if you are looking for headspace youre barking up the wrong tree. Recently took mg and experienced what I would consider a mild headspace with mild visuals though its certainly relative considering my highest LSD dose is ug. Ive arrived at the conclusion that CB is just a mild psychedelic. This is both a positive and a negative depending on what you are looking for. For me its a negative. I dont know how much more intense the headspacevisuals get at doses beyond mg but Im hesitant to find out. mg had a pleasant bodyload but mg introduced muscle spasms gastrointestinal discomfort and a severe nextmorning headache.Just go with LSD or mushrooms for headspace.  ,2cb,delrty2,1,t5_2xazx

11154415,0,t1_dewc12s,Yeah. I ordered grams. Already used about mg myself and given away right over mg. Also promised a dude mg since I borrowed some from him. I figure I have about a gram left.,2cb,dewcal1,2,t5_2xazx
11286280,0,t1_df8wv20,depends what you want out of your trip. Also depends how big you are my foot gf needs significantly less than me. If its your first time Id recommend starting low say mg or so colours brightened things warping slightly. For a more visual trip mgmg is where it starts getting visual. mg and your gonna have a decently heavy trip. mgmg is where the real full blown trip is for me atleast you will be completely encapsulated in visuals. I highly recommend some good meditation in your trip dont have to go crazy with this for results just as long as you focus on slow steady breathing no shallow breaths it gives you the most crazy visuals you will get.,2cb,dfba7oq,1,t5_2xazx
11389195,0,t1_dfmiyjd,It increases your chance of a bad trip if you drink before or during the peak because of lowered inhibitions. These lowered inhibitions make it very easy to hurt yourself or others take into account the fact that most suicides happen under the influence of alcohol. With that being said im sure youre fine drinking after the peak its just good to be aware that combining psychedelics with alcohol isnt a great idea.,2cb,dfmy32i,0,t5_2xazx
11405949,0,t1_dfo6ysz,Having taken mg myself I would compare the bodyload of the dose to be about  of an MDMA body high. Your body will feel electric and the shivers are constant so you will almost not want to sit down during the whole trip. On the comedown it feels like sharp needles under your skin but feels like a massage so it doesnt hurt.,2cb,dfoulqg,1,t5_2xazx
