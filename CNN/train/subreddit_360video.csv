This was made for seated VR experiences so its more about moving around to look at the huge depth perception in VR really sells this scenery,360video,d3t6jqb,1,t5_2rhwt

8766116,0,t3_5018g7,So I think that the metadata tool that Google or YouTube provideSearch spatial metadata tool and it can do that reverse of equirectangular to polar Polar to Equirectangular  which is what I think you are looking for.  If you have the .mp file I believe there is a distortpolar coordinates function that you can use to change it back and forth.,360video,d71fdx1,1,t5_2rhwt
9758210,0,t1_dafweb3,Yeah you can do this with the Ricoh Thetavideo app right on your phone.  There a GoPro VR plugin that will allow to do this in Premiere.  Its much easier than doing it in AutoPano Video Pro.  Own both the Theta S and the GoPro Omni.  Theta S for stills Omni for video.,360video,dafx1un,2,t5_2rhwt
