5473330,0,t3_3q12mv,Honestly unless it is a k or a few select others dont waste your energy moving someone from  or  stars.  Instead fuse those heroes to get a new one.  Also when I level up my fodder I will do it in Easy.  A level  goes to level  in one successful run.  And if you chose a Boss level there is only  wave so you should be able to clear it in a minute or so.  Sorry I know I am bouncing around a lot but Li can go in the front row for you.  He can absorb the hits with his immunity so you can put him next to Evan.  ,7kglobal,cwb9pdr,1,t5_3aev3

5605119,0,t3_3rrqmr,Just a small tip for Mondays CR if you want to maximize damage. If youre trying to get a dedicated dispeller for Rudys shield buff Joker by himself can handle it as long as his def is high enough. This is due to Rudys skill having a cooldown of  seconds while Jokers is  sec. Thus youll be able to dispel Rudy right away as long as you keep using Jokers Magic Hat right after Rudys shield since Jokers cooldown will go off the closest to RudysThis unfortunately doesnt work with Heavenia  sec cooldown and Ariel  sec cooldown since their cooldown is longer than Rudys so youll have to run these two together if you dont have Joker.Also great guide good job sharing it with the community.,7kglobal,cwrvaw6,2,t5_3aev3

However items of those stats can be obtained through Raids. While admittedly it would probably take a very long while to obtain items of those stats from raids it is accessible in the game. You must acknowledge that at the other end of this game are the people who want to make a profit out of this. No one would run this game if it doesnt rake them profits. The way I see it its perfectly fair. To be honest the fact that it costs so much just to get  items is beneficial to us casual players  where Netmarble maximises the profits it makes at the lowest benefits awarded. ,7kglobal,czn1oxm,3,t5_3aev3

Hot time  increased stuff. Weekday  x gold during hot time Weekend  Increased drop rate of hero cards when farming Fuse her if you want. You can always farm more Yuri in World  ?. At this point in the game dont worry about keeping  stars. Fuse and hope for decent  stars. Only  stars you should hold on to are KnightsLords.I dont want to rub you the wrong way but the game tells you the ingame events and their timings. It also gives you the time zone it goes by. You simply take the time zone provided and turn it into whatever time zone you use most often.,7kglobal,d0atmpd,1,t5_3aev3
6692547,0,t1_d0bhn70,Im stuck in about the same place as you  can barely reach  but will not be able to stay there and will drop to  every other week.  Jave is pretty weak right now since the meta is filled with physical immune characters Dellons Ruri Nia MingMing. I think Velika would do better as your backrow or even Ruri since its easier to transcend Ruri to .  If you decide on Velika as your backrow see if you can replace Eileen for someone like May or Rudy since her passive wont benefit Velika.  If you decide on Ruri as your backrow you can keep Eileene.  Either way probably spend your hero selectors on your backrow unit since it is probably more impactful to have a stronger backrow than a stronger frontrow.  In addition if theyre permanent selectors you can wait to get World  characters. But expect them to be available at least  weeks after its release tomorrow. ,7kglobal,d0bkgfw,1,t5_3aev3

6921451,0,t3_4aiyf6,Im focusing on arena since I got my Ruri and before the release of Ming Ming I can easily reach .  But now with almost everyone running Ming Ming or Wukong I barely reach .  From my experience to win at arena today you need to   Have very fast units and a lot of ccs Silence Paralyze andor Electrify   Have a way to deal with a bunch of Wukongs after killing him for the first time    Current high tier teams have a mix of speed cc and a Wukong. If you dont have a Wukong you need to excel at the other  speed and cc to win.  A turtle team can fight well in the beginning against current meta but will suffer to deal with Wukong after he revives.    My advice based on what I knows is to work on your Ruri and Spike. And wait for new characters like Black Rose and the K skill revamp that will make spikes passive last  turns.    Good luck. ,7kglobal,d10vca4,2,t5_3aev3

But if you want to be more Arena heavy DaisyMingRuri would benefit from an unlock to boost their damage assuming you have a good weapon for them of course.

Not sure why some expect Ace to wreck enemies by that skill it already does more damage than any skills and will even get better he can already contribute by just standing decreasing enemys armor.

7143945,0,t1_d1q698d,Um I didnt know about pierce ignoring Mays and Velikas passive. I guess we all have new things to learn every day. Point being though that there are other counters to pierce units even if they are available to them as well. Just as Rudy is available to them to mitigate incoming damage. gt Are you serious? Im sorry if you dont see why theres a need to stop instakill attacks from k AOE nukes when most of the units in PVP have under that in HP.And in case you forgot all units without Pierce Void Shield Zombie or Block passive effectively become worthless once this meta kicks off. Im sorry for wanting more than  of our units being usable.Im sorry but the fact is that new units have to be significantly better than current units to entice players to pull more units anyway. And k AOE attacks? The only units with AOE pierce right now are Lubu and Rei so please do not exaggerate the situation now. If your complaint is about Lubu you could probably attribute that to people spending tons of cash to get enough copies of Lubu. And not being happy about that goes towards the payingfree player argument which I would rather avoid. Plus even if only  of our units are usable thats only true for Arena. The other units are useful for other aspects of the game  daily dungeons raids castle rush adventure mode. gt No it really isnt. Let me make a simple comparison for you.The Average for units is B Grade. Most units are C Grade uber Units like Lubuthe new upgraded ks except Rudy Ming Ming and Lucy are A Grade. Units like Velika Daisy Rei and Rudy who excel at their job but suck at everything else are B Grade.So you think the new Rudy is a B grade while all the other Ks are A grade? Then you must be out of your mind. If you are talking about Arena I do not see how Eileene  Rachel  Spike  Jave do not fall into your B grade description  they are only good at one thing and they suck at everything else. But lets stop arguing for the sake of arguing  what is it you want to see added to Rudy anyway? Allow him to be tankier despite him being the tankiest hero around anyway? Longer debuff immunity? ,7kglobal,d1q6vza,-2,t5_3aev3

All of them are carrying speed weapons except jave who is carrying crit. I have read that in arena the hero with the highest speed will do hisher normal attack first then the team with the highest overall speed will cast skill first. I was matched up with a team and at the first move my opponent ming did a normal attack first. After that my team cast skills first This imply  things  My dellons who is the fastest with  speed is outsped by ming and  My team overall speed is still higher thus i cast skills first. However after the match i went to check and i found out that the ming had only  speed. How is it posible that a lower speed ming move faster than my dellons who outspeed it by  points? is there some explanation to it? And some times when i checked the overall speed of my opponent after the match i realise that they are slower than me but yet they still cast their skills first. Any reason or explanation for my situation? Any help will be appreciated. thanks.TLDR My dellons is faster yet doesnt normal attack first my team overall spd is faster but doesnt cast skill first.

7645856,0,t1_d3ba4fy,speed helps you go again after a normal attack and allows for skills to be pulled off first before the enemy team which helps in both pve and pvp.  So its best to have critspd for both.  Counter helps as well and hp is only for tanky teams or longer survival if you think your team cant do enough damage to end it quickly.  Also your team depending on items and levels and all that could get you somewhat decently planted in arena you have ming and dellons yushin is a great pierce hero and they all are damage immune for a few turns.  Plus free rubies and topaz always helps even at upper bronze.,7kglobal,d3bajk3,1,t5_3aev3

7654364,0,t1_d3c7axa,How exactly would you make them viable again? By giving her revive thats double the hp a defensive tank would normally have. Thats a minimum of  hp from  . Times that by  and you will get her to . Thats including no hp armor by the way. Rudys   is  and Evans  is  so thats a ridiculous number Plus all single targeting moves usually its the most powerful attack for a unit used by her taunt skill will be nullednicked or become near useless because she would have a strong passive and block rate to boot. If anything why would I want Rudy and Evan to be in the team if she does everything a tank should be doing which is taking hits and actually redirecting attacks to her. Or think of this way you do make Rudy and Evan viable but you instead shift it to an extreme turtle meta which would essentially make Arena battles significantly longer and in due course guild war battles. Any offensiveoriented units would become useless like Eileene and Dellons and everyone must have Spike to guarantee no status effect BS.I know you obviously hate the hyper offensive teams especially how bloody OP Lubu like everyone else says but eventually it will come to pass with the introduction to the multi hit concept and more void shield units. In most peoples testimony about KRs meta Lu Bu is not seen in most teams.The reason why everyone but defensive units have a revive is because they are squishy and only necessarily contribute to the overall offense with some longevity.,7kglobal,d3c9b90,1,t5_3aev3

Thus oftentimes your heroes will be wasting their skills in PvP on the remaining heroes who will often have damage immunity Ming Ming Daisy Dellons Yu Shin the list goes onampnbspWhy is this the case? I honestly feel you should be able to attack enemies that are frozen. In the current state GIVING the enemy freeze basically gives them IMMUNITY from your attacks.ampnbspLets compare this to StunParalysis. If you stunparalyse the enemy they become useless AND your heroes can still attack them.ampnbspDoes anyone else agree with me? On another note  Spikes Frozen Earthquake REALLY needs a buff in my opinion Its a  attack on all enemies with a low chance of Freeze which as explained above isnt actually that good of a status.  attack is very low compared to Ming Ming and Yu Shins massive attacks of Ultimate Dandelion and Lightning Strike which is  damage PLUS  of their max HP!.ampnbspThanks,7kglobal,d3he6zy,1,t5_3aev3

Not too sure they prohibit selectors from events but Im uncertain if they consider bought items as events I wouldnt risk it. According to some of my friends and Is thinkings HP will start dominating again with the new awakened items. While awakening an item increases its HP up to  more and block only adding about  do the math what do you think will be better?

I wasnt playing when he supposedly had his  turn damage immunity so I will always lose that argument if you are going to make that case. Now hes a bloody joke. For being the main antagonist of the games story you think he would be strong at least.Dellons the one Seven Knight no one will want now and hell only continue to worse.

9284664,0,t1_d8swaed,My advice is to focus on the ace. He was be used in every facet of the game for the most part. Most will say build a raid team too so Sieg might not be bad. Just realize that Karma is an old lord and extremely powerful and will tend to be that way for either forever or a long time. I would look into getting x monsters who can clear  in  spells without any loses. I use Dellonsjave but acekarma works well too. This way you can farm rubies fast.

9756411,0,t3_5ewi9r,In other news new threads are being made about Pooki rework as we speak.Im also pretty sure no one have said anything about an Ace rework yet except maybe hoping NM will give him the  hits Lunar Slash like in KR but that hardly counts as a revampEDIT Okay nvm after looking deep into the subreddit I did find two topics about Ace reworks.Cmon a topic here or there with people having some fun discussing about game mechanics and units rebalancing are now apparently triggering others now? Yes ok I admit that in my Lu Bu rework thread my initial suggestion was way too OP. And now that I think about it its probably best that they buff his skills to be more PVE oriented for Hell Dungeon or World Boss. But I was simply trying to start a conversation and discussion about his kit and his possible future as a special unit. Discussion is the key word hereUnless you have a Lvl  Lu Bu I dont think anyone want to go back to the dark age when he was the king of Arena where the meta is two Lu Bu smacking each other with the players hoping that their Lu Bu is less retarded than the other Lu BuSeriously I thought that Reddit was a place for people to talk to each other about the same interest in this case K. Why are we getting shut down and insulted when we try to have a discussion about the bloody game? Yes we are not professional game developer so most of the balancing ideas will not be good. But thats when people who might have some more experience with the game came in and offer an alternate solution. That Ling Ling rework thread that I made a while back has a lot of people coming in and talking about the game mechanic. There were a lot of good suggestions there. And while we didnt get what we wanted it was fun. Thats what I want. Thats ALL I want. Im not demanding NM to make Lu Bu the way I imagined him. I just want to have a discussion with the community about the game and one of its special unitYou know its funny. I recently visited another subreddit about another less popular game GirlXBattle and difference between this subreddit and that one was night and day. There were many topics about units skillsets team comp rebalancing new players asking for help and everyone offered extremely helpful answers. I guess the bigger and more competitive the game become the more serious everyone gets about it which eventually cause the atmosphere around the community to become more and more toxic. What a shameBut you know what? Fine lets all just forget that this whole thing happen okay? Youre the moderator youre the boss. If thats how you want it Ill obliged. Lets just all enjoy the game for what it is and wait for NM to have the final say on everything.,7kglobal,dafp2dh,3,t5_3aev3

10953902,0,t1_de9p0zg,Hmmm its actually pretty hard to say without simply trying Hell DD on the various days and seeing what happens xD If you have a bunch of multihit heroes you could probably do Saturday Hell DD even if your heroes are low level since most of the multihit units have voidhit shields and because the enemies in Saturday Hell DD have really low hp after their hit shields are gone.The rest of them are a little harder or easier depending on how you want to look at it so you might need higher transcendsgear if you want to be able to do them. Ive heard of people being able to do Hell DD with a geared  Rin but you definitely need the last mastery to be able to do that. Since you dont have the last mastery your Rin will need higher transcends to compensate. Id say at least  will most likely be enough but honestly getting the last mastery would be much easier than waiting a month or two to obtain two Rins xDThis is all assuming your Rin has awakened weapons as well as damage jewelsaccessory. You will also need to pair her with DellonsKarma an AcePascalA. Yuri preferably A. Yuri before Ace and Ace before Pascal and possibly a Rachel depending on if you need an additional debuffer to drastically increase Rins damage output seriously with all their skillspassives they increase Rins damage by several times the original amount. You should pick up Rachel asap anyways as she is used in multiple areas in PvE and still remains relevant in KR even to this day so she is a really good investment.If I could only pick one seven knights unit to use I would pick Rachel.  Lords would be Rin and OL would be Karma.The last two units you would need for Hell DD are either SpikeA. Elysia or a unit with status immunity for the daily CC and Yushin or Mao Song depending on the day. You can clear most Hell DD with this team so you really dont have to invest much to be able to clear to clear Hell DD consistently.Hope this helped! Best of luck and have fun ,7kglobal,de9tfd4,2,t5_3aev3

If awakened Shane can secure  more damage than awakened Jupy we probably no longer need the nd most of the time.

11148861,0,t1_devgvsu,As much as I despise the k cost for a  WB item with a random substat it seems to me like its the smarter move.  There is so just so much RNG needed to get the right item from K points that your odds are just not good enough.  Assuming that the  drop rate is  what it was before any possible ninja nerf you have roughly a  chance to get a six star version of just the item type you want armor p weapon m weapon.  Your chances drop to  to get the right type of item plus a specific substat.  Obviously your chances are better if you need more than one type of item or substat but with the meta right now physical weapons are a bajillion times more useful than magic weapons or armor. I had K WB points when the items came out and I got four  stars but  were armors and one was a completely useless magic crit rate weapon.  Im fighting a near impossible battle now to compete in WB with people who have only one WB weapon.So now Im saving up my  WB points per day to get a  point weapon. In my opinion thats the most logical option.,7kglobal,devpmb2,3,t5_3aev3

For shame that its unfortunate that you underestimate the value of yes and now you try to indicate that it is of lesser value. Please support the answer yes rather than making any other assumption that indicating any specific changes wouldve diminished the effect of any big changes and thus wouldnt be considered big changes.

If the  point difference could only be  points maximum I feel that could be the most fair and easiest fix they could implement into their system. At that rate the difference between point gainloss is around  points so the impact felt from a losing streak wont be so horrible. I understand it would be too difficult for them to take in all the variables such as transcends gear etc and come up with an appropriate formula but that should be something fairly simple they could change.,7kglobal,dfu6as8,1,t5_3aev3

While am a little fine with this development l still think NM Global are a little lazy with this their specialisation idea without spending more time to balance out the spread.

11493826,0,t3_640zh9,Thank you. This is the most concise perspective I have read on this subreddit over the past couple days regarding the recent patch. Their current method of hero implementation is nothing more than a lazy and temporary bandaid solution for character balance. Its essentially copypasta some units base skills tagging an extremely limited ability or passive in red text that only works in one part of the game and calling it an awakening. This approach in content design will only worsen the diversity of team building even with the inevitable power creep that every mobile game is experiencing. New and veteran players alike will feel constantly gated by every mode in the game due to the requirement of needing this particular character in order to stay remotely competitive.Also this may just be me but I really dont think Shane is fine at all even if she reduces raid times to sub  minutes per round. Whats the point of a reward ranking system if everyone obliterates a midend game boss and receives the same rewards? Its like You better have an awakened Shane or forever receive participation chests until you do.Sieg has been talked about already... so yeah.,7kglobal,dfytol6,5,t5_3aev3

11748339,0,t1_dgroxgw,Its doable enough. I have a regular  hour job and I get my farming done within the duration of hot time. Glance at the phone every  minutes or so to restock fodders and be done before lunchtime. Heck you can even do it somehow throughout the day with maybe an hour of focus and letting the game run whenever you have keys. ,7kglobal,dgrpc5r,1,t5_3aev3

11809258,0,t1_dgxsvwg,I just think Ruri may be more efficient is all but I would say Miho has a lot more survivability than a low lv Spike and she can provide some pretty good damage  utility as well,7kglobal,dgymcfo,1,t5_3aev3
