388442,0,t1_cfkzviu,I guess you are right. I know that they only approve screen accurate stuff bad choice of words on my part. I meant that I know there are different levels of armor that people put thousands into I wasnt asking for that. Thanks for the help I had a feeling  was to good to be true,501st,cfl1094,1,t5_2qtvd
430992,0,t1_cfp4ua9,Awesome thank you for all this information and yes it did make sense. As I just said to another user here my plan now is to get active on the NEG boards get to know some people there and maybe meet up with them at events. I was already planning to go to Boston Comic Con dressed as Captain America this year and I met some of the st last year so I can talk to them there and maybe get some more information on what the armor is like. Thanks again!,501st,cfpfr27,1,t5_2qtvd

3560535,0,t1_cpy499z,Trooperbay has been fantastic with my orders.  But its not a huge operation so a week turnaround isnt brow raising.  If the same guy runs MTK kits Im sure youre in good hands.,501st,cpy4k84,1,t5_2qtvd

3712984,0,t3_32x6bm,You could probably get away with doing the th Armored Division or the engineer variant as long as the Phase II clone armor was up to standard specs but youd have to appeal to the Legion Membership Liaison. The th Armored Division isnt one of the already approved variants but it meets the requirements for a new variant three sources. Your best bet for reference would be the sources listed on Wookieepedia the figure the CCG card and the RPG. Note Both the toy and CCG links are dead. Youll have to find the toycard or pictures of it somewhere.,501st,cqfi7i8,2,t5_2qtvd
4223022,0,t1_cs0n1ou,The nice thing about orange is that we have that stuff on lockdown. So many references so many solid sources of parts and easy to find fabric plus the bonus of the customizable helmet. Its good to be orange.,501st,cs1lqxv,-13,t5_2qtvd
4576216,0,t1_ct7fr9p,It didnt. Was just a CMA thing in case someone else read it that way. Now the real question is why arent you at your post? ,501st,ct7fu3k,1,t5_2qtvd

4856882,0,t3_3hdcdr,Not saying this is perfect but I thought itd be a good starting point for you  this youtube channel and associated website Tested.com is partly run by Adam Savage from the mythbusters and has a ton of AWESOME tutorials on how professionals make things. Check em out and their website or the RPF replica Prop Forums website for starters they will have a ton of answers for you. The video I linked by the way is about hot to make and cast from a silicone mold which you had previously mentioned.,501st,cu6qw27,1,t5_2qtvd

4977768,0,t3_34bxji,There is a thread on whitearmor.net that talks about gluing rubber to something. I cant link you right now as I cant get on the site at the moment but perhaps somebody else can hint hint? Also I thought ttrack was made out of plastic? ampnbspIf all else fails you could try sewing it on but havent tried that and I dont know if it would work. Again maybe somebody else knows? ,501st,culzh0g,1,t5_2qtvd

5564925,0,t3_3rby15,Thats me! SL.  The CEO of Alama drafthouse has a tradition where he breaks open champaign bottles with his samurai sword.  He said something along the lines of...if the cork doesnt come out this theater will be a failure.  If the cork comes out this theater will be a success.  No pressure right?  He asks for the st to have the honors so I voluteer to take the sword and I popped the cork on my try.  ,501st,cwmvo6j,2,t5_2qtvd
6093566,0,t1_cyhr4vn,These are able to be modified there are a ton for threads on the SL detachment forum about modding the black series helmet with really good results. On the plus side they dont seem to be that difficult in comparison to the rest of the costume.There are even more WIP work in progress threads on the SL forum that are pretty invaluable while Ive been researching my own kylo and would strongly recommend anyone that is thinking about making their own kylo to check them out.,501st,cyi9xgy,2,t5_2qtvd
6836010,0,t1_d0r5ny6,Would love criticism because i have to get it reviewed by my CO and team then up to legion.   I noticed that too.  Its a draft so Im still  tweaking it.  Good eye.  Actually there is no white border on our garrison logo i just did a stroke around it but I did an outside stroke instead of a center stroke.  That should fix that issue.    Never would have caught that  Ill mess with it for sure.Thanks for the input. ,501st,d0r5wle,1,t5_2qtvd

11355386,0,t3_621t6v,Contact your local garrison and ask the GML. I dont think it would be a problem at all we have troopers with prosthetics walkers etc. Shouldnt be an issue. ,501st,dfj41no,19,t5_2qtvd
