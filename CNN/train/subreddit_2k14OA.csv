166733,0,t3_1vxg7c,Start out by telling us a little something about your team I really like my team but Im not in love with how they are so inconsistent. Aldridge is outstanding and Ellis is dynamic but the other players on my team are average.How Happy are you with your team on a scale from  Im about a  Ive been blown out by  and Ive won games by .How happy are you with your teams defense on a scale of . The only defender in my starting  that I have faith in is Gortat. I give up way too many points and I dont get consecutive stops often.How happy are you with your teams offense on a scale of  . I can get easy buckets often and I always shoot above  in a game. I shot  in a half in a game I lost. Only problem is my teams  pointers are weak and if Swaggy isnt hitting then Ill tend to shy away from s. How happy are you with your bench on a scale from . My bench is so weak that Ill often just play my starters for longer than I should. I have solid depth in my frontcourt and Thabeet is a hidden gem. But everyone else can be so streaky and terrible. Expectations coming into seasonI didnt have championship expectations but Im super competitive so I was looking for a playoff birth. Right now at  Im looking decent for a late seed but I feel like I should be in better shape. I feel like Im barely underperforming. Expectations Now Still want that playoff birth and I want to be the underdog to shock the league by beating the top teams. Future My team isnt old by any means but they arent all young either. Im always looking to improve my team so Ill listen to any offers. I should be in good shape for the next  years. Anything Else Aldridge is an underrated star but I really need another guy who can play the  or  that can also help take the load off him. I want to use Jack as a th man and move Ellis to my PG or something similar. Really interested in getting some offers.,2k14OA,cexf9ui,4,t5_2z02j
