95865,0,t3_1v5sft,Good morning!  And it is a good morning!  For the first night in a long time my youngest didnt get up during the middle of the night!My breakfast varies a bit depending on day of the week  workout plan  time available.  If Im off to a workout  swim in the morning before work Ill typically grab something like a banana before I leave and have something quick like eggs or cereal or porridge after.Occasionally typically on a weekend on a day with a long run Ill plan a more elaborate breakfast for after the run  make waffles or french toast or bacon and eggs.Yesterday started off poorly.  I was running late and got to the YMCA late.  When I was getting ready for my swim I realized that I had forgot to turn on the slow cooker at home so I ended up hitting the steam room relaxed for a few minutes then went home to get the slow cooker going.  I did a three mile run after work instead of the swim and planned to do the swim today.Today I started off getting my swim in.  I successfully completed an  m set so now Im more than half way to what I need for a tri.  I still need to figure out what to do for dinner tonight.  Have a great day!,90daysgoal,cepceea,2,t5_2s0sd

213761,0,t3_1wjyui,Stress Hmm... when Im stressed I like to do whatever I can to address the problem and ignore everything else in life.  Its harder to do these days because like I have to stop working to feed my kids and stuff.  But Im definitely the sort of person who will work  hrs a week if no one stops me neglecting everything else.  Self care tends to be the first thing to fall off the queue for me.  POne of the big things Ive been working on between this round amp last has been making sure that selfcare remains a priority for me.  The way I see it I am going to experience stress one way or another.  But I have a choice as to whether or not the stress is the ONLY thing in my life.  Having daily time to myself generally in the form of exercise but sometimes spent on other hobbies means that Im happier and healthier in the long run.  It can be really hard to fit it in but... there is almost never anything SO important that getting it done an hour earlier because I skipped my workout is going to make a big difference.Yesterday was mixed.  I got a ton of stuff done for school.  The antibiotics Im taking for my upcoming root canal really hit me hard yesterday though and I was pretty sick by the end of the day.  Ugh.  Theyre superstrong antibiotics and its only a  day course but Im so over it already.Today work from home  I was up most of the night with heartburn because I stupidly took the antibiotics and then laid down which is apparently a no and there was just no way I was getting to the lab today email professor about add code test code change for thesis run  it is  okay if this is just  mile around the block.  I only have a  scheduled anyhow.,90daysgoal,cf2siwn,1,t5_2s0sd

357126,0,t1_cfhpsw1,Strangers on the internet can be an amazing source of support D  Cooking for one  my life!  I find that cooking in bulk is really useful and a major time saver.  I typically plan out my meals for the week and grocery shop and prep on a Sunday  sometimes Ill do a massive batch of a crockpot meal keep a few portions in the fridge for the week and then freeze the rest in individual containers and save them for months on end and just finally use them when Im in a time crunch.  I also will cook up a big batch of chicken early in the week and throw it in a tupperware and just portion it out as the week goes along.  For example I bought  pounds yesterday cut it into bitesized pieces and cooked it today for lunch for work I heated up a bunch of frozen veggies brussels sprouts broccoli carrots while I was doing my makeup put the container on the food scale and measured out a certain portion of chicken and then added some peanut satay sauce and soy sauce mixed it up and threw it in my bag.   minutes total  min for the veggies in the microwave plus  to add the chicken sauce and close the tupperware.  And during the  I was doing my own thing   For dinner I might go home throw a sweet potato or more veggies in the microwave and add chicken and some other sauce or spices.  Again no more than  minutes.  Doing the meatcooking seems like the toughtimeconsuming part so if you get that all out of the way in advance its easy peasy.  Frozen veggies are great for one  makes sure they dont go bad before you have a chance to eat them and you can get them in bulk without wasting.  ,90daysgoal,cfhs6bt,5,t5_2s0sd

My husband is going to have lots of jokes about this because Im Russian and according to him all Russians live off sour cream.Unfortunately I dont track food. Terrible food tracker. Ive tried and tried and failed. But Im starting to think Im undereating considering the addition of lifting to my weekly regiment. I dont eat a lot of carbs as I have a gluten issue... unless theyre beans and rice. I eat the heck out of beans rice guac and sour cream. My main problem is food during the workday. Im setting snack alarms. lol. Im going to start checking off my five meals a day to make sure I eat enough. I dont usually have an issue with quality of my meals but my day meals lack in convenience and therefore get skipped  often.I actually packed sour cream rice puddings yogurts pickles can beans amys chilies cookies and crackers today.

459344,0,t3_1zb976,Hi! Im going to jump in for the rest of the  days.

I know Im a bit ahead of everyone else but Im so proud of myself for the amount of improvement Ive seen in just the last two weeks. An hour long work out with my heart rate up seemed impossible then. Now Im taking significantly less breaks even during burpees. p  This week my plans are a less intense since . Im home for spring break and dont have access to weights and . Im getting my wisdom teeth out... self explanatory. Anyway my optimal week hopefully attainable... but will probably be adjusted based on my recovery looks like this   Sunday Yoga early on reading for class dinner with dad and grandma bodyweight workout tonight over Skype with my long distance boyfriend.    Monday Nothing. Wisdom Teeth come out early in the morning.   Tuesday Again nothing planned fitnesswise. Get some reading done for classes.   Wednesday ?

Today I hit my  miles despite feeling really crummy and having a super bad headache. Running actually made it feel better while I was running and for a short while after but then it came back with a vengeance. Im on track with my diet though yesterday I was bad and barely ate. Tomorrow is a rest day but a soft goal is to walk  miles. I was planning on doing this outside but its been incredibly cold so probably will not happen.

524889,0,t3_203pkx,Strategies Here is how I keep myself on track I checkin here.  Even in a worst case scenario where no one reads my post I FEEL more accountable and focused having listed out my goals for the day.   I have a sticker chart at home where I track my big  goals exercise food tracking and thesis hours.  Its a simple concept  do the thing for the day earn the corresponding sticker.  That way I can quickly see if Ive been really awesome or really sucky the past few days. I try to focus and work really hard when Im work on tasks  and be as lazy as I feel like when I have free time.  This is important for me because I am really a DO ALL THE THINGS ALL THE TIME kind of person and if I dont keep that tendency in check I end up exhausted and burnt out and miserable etc.  Yesterday was good.  I dutifully did my speed workout in the morning a k tempo run with an easy mile before and after.  Discovered that theres a pleasant enough loop not too far from my house that is exactly a mile around and fairly flat which made it easy to tell whether I was on pace or not.  After that I went to campus got confused about an exam I thought was yesterday its Wednesday skipped lifting to cram went to class then lifted afterwards.  Made me a little late getting home but I felt a lot better after doing it.  My lifts are progressing so nicely!  Um what else... I worked on my thesis again!   cats in the past  days!  WOOOOOOO!Today bike to work woooo run . mi recovery with  strides at the end.  It was windy as hell which SUCKED wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooork  guys I think I finally sorted out that bug though I have no idea why my fix works.  I am a savant! finish lab thats due tomorrow really email thesis advisor more thesis work I will give you a cat for  minutes today because I know it is hard to do ANYTHING on work days  weeeeak effort but weak is better than no effort do flashcards for exam for  minutes light rail time would be perfect for this track food,90daysgoal,cfzxp2i,6,t5_2s0sd

Half the time I feel like this is a mental game I cant win and the other half of the time Im convinced my body is committing mutiny via public humiliation. Its enough to make me want to scrap this trainingupcoming half and just run when my body feels like it can handle it but I dont want to give up so Im struggling through. ,90daysgoal,ch75pwr,1,t5_2s0sd

I didnt do many outings with them but I walked with her and some of her friends in a few events like St. Judes Give Thanks Walk on Thanksgiving and I think she did Komen with my work friends and me one year. They do races and fun runs and marathons and stuff and they have all kinds of running tutus and great gear and travel to wear costumes and participate in events. Im so happy for her as her joy in running seems to radiate through the rest of her life and make her such a great person to be around.I run solo when I do run.

Theres a halle de sport literally two minutes from my house but do you think that giant building has a single free weight in it? More gymnasiumindoor courts sort of thing but no pool sadly!. My gym is a teensy two room affair thats only open six days a week and two of those six days only for four hours. And also closes stat holidays there are a lot of those out here. Which is normal business hours here which leaves me wondering when the French do anything lol.

Last night I made a decentlysized batch of chocolatehazelnut syrup and this morning found the container tipped over in the fridge coating the shelf with a viscous mess.  So that was a bummer of a morning but I ate pancakes to compensate.Yesterday I made spontaneous plans with a friend who Im going hiking with in a few hours.  We tried out a bunch of different knot configurations for the rope were going to finally use for climbing this local tower.  My backneck was screaming by the end of it since I had to keep climbing up a tree to tie the rope had to test the knots by climbing the rope had to climb up the tree to undo the rope and jump down...Then I went to the liquor store to grab vodka for making more liqueurs and beer for summiting the tower aaaand I forgot my wallet like a schmuck.  Bummer but I can get all that today.  So then I ran . miles instead of  because I told AlyElle who ran  instead of . that I would.  RunKeeper kept telling me I had run for .  Very annoying but I have a gist of what my pace was.  I owe AlyElle a half mile  or a kilometer or whatever.Today OH MAN.  HIKING.  CLIMBING THE THING.  DRINKING A BEER.  RUNNING.  RUNNING AND DRINKING BEER.  AND PEOPLE.  AND WIZARDS.  WOO!Technically a bodyweight exercise day.

1574149,0,t1_cjdjegj,Thought so!  This is what Im doing  Its hard to see but were taking Valley Way up Madison and staying in the Madison the first day.  Thats the toughest part and those  miles will take almost  hours.  The next day were doing the rest about  miles  hours.  Well add parts like Mt Clay if we are ahead of schedule but if for some reason were behind well have to skip some peaks.  We arent doing Jackson since that will add   hours and we wont have enough daylight.  Plus its name after a NH geologist not Andrew Jackson so it technically isnt a presidential.  This page is how I found out how long each section should take us.  Using the book time well be able to determine if were making good time or if well have to skip some parts.  I found the message you sent me and I have a couple of things to add.      Check sunrise and sunset for each day youre out.     NO COTTON SOCKS.  I stepped in a lot of water the other day and my shoes felt dry  minutes later because I was wearing decent hiking socks.  If you wear cotton there is a chance that you may hate yourself pretty quick. I invested in a hydration pack that my pack has a space for about .  So much easier than grabbing your bottle every  seconds and carries a lot more water.I havent done this hike yet and dont have a ton of hiking under my belt but I have done a ton of research.  Several of my friends have done it so feel free to ask if you have any questions and if I dont know I can ask them.

Today which is usually a day off from working out I went on an unplanned run before work. My job has been a disaster I cannot seem to check any tasks from my todo list.  Thats a small exaggeration but I feel like I am not making any progress.  I stayed late today which was ridiculous.  I had errands to run after work which I couldnt do because I needed to get home to my dogs.  The big dinner I planned turned into take out pizza.  Im cool with that.  But I hate when work infringes on my personal time.  I mean I even took a few things home in order to catch up.  Next week at work has to be different.  I have to make that happen.

I just...I worked really hard to stay reasonable with portions and it makes me really sad even if intellectually I know its probably a temporary fluctuation. Sigh. Question for yall do you track your weight every day or every week? If every day do you find it more or less anxietyprovoking to see the scale go up and down?

2234288,0,t3_2kp5ys,Ranch is probably the one with the highest calories though warm bacon dressing has to be up there Bacon drippings sugar R.W. vinegar and mustard. I really love balsamic vinaigrette when being healthy it goes with a wide range of salad types.  Also adding strong herbs like cilantro or chives will distract from a light dressing.It really depends what the salad is replacing. A typical homemade lunch meat sandwich will come in around  calories depending on bread cheese and condiment type. Salads esp. wo cheese are practically nothing before the dressing.  You could cover a bowl of veggies in Ranch and end up with a  calorie lunch decreasing calories and increasing vitamins fiber etc. Think of it like hiding medicine from a child. If you know you wont eat a salad sprayed in a lighter option it is worth making room for those dressing calories.,90daysgoal,clntyc0,1,t5_2s0sd

2388818,0,t3_2mqogp,Tuesday was strange. Just feeling like Im in a funk so I skipped my workout. Tidied and painted my nails instead. Wednesday got up early to lift and had the most dismal session ever. I went in feeling defeated and just never got my head right. Did one squat set at my working weight then dropped it down even though I didnt actually fail the set. Got another set out but then I did fail the lower set and gave up on squats. Did one set at working weight on bench again didnt fail but abandoned ship anyway. Did x lb weighted negative pullups instead of rows then dragged my ass to the shower. What a shitty way to start the day. May try to get up early again tomorrow and redo the workouts. Blech.Also on the plate for today Help undergrad with presentation Run samples fingers crossed it works! Dry samples Group meeting Snap out of this mood.,90daysgoal,cm6yr9c,2,t5_2s0sd

She gained another pound which is excellent.  Shes  months off the track and needed to put on some weight.  Now shes ready for maintenance .  I met the installer who set up the new DW.  I had a CL buyer pick up my guest bed including the free mattress. I had another CL buyer who bought some outdoor furniture and my wine fridge.  She might come back for the China cabinet.  Fingers crossed!!  Mamma needs to pay the movers! In between that I packed laundered the last of the bedding for storage and picked up some groceries for dinner.  I finished the day with some lifting a few extra pounds on my bent knee deadlift!TODAY is more moving prep. Paint bedroom. Im expecting this to take most of the day. Laundry Housework Lifting  arms  Hopefully not cooking.WEEKEND SANITY SAVER  For the last  weeks weve devoted each weekend to our upcoming move.

Normally on Saturday wed go on a long hike anywhere from  miles to  miles in the ski mountain or a  mile trail run in the ski mountain.  We recently started bringing Gina on our hike  miles is her max.  She LOVES hiking especially the part when she gets her own peanut butter and jelly sandwich!

Ive been adding things gradually so I dont get overwhelmed with new things and should be doing the complete program on my next workout Wed.Even with just doing it for a week Ive been amazed at seeing how things are progressing.  My plank times are improving my flexibility is improving.  My muscles are hurting more.  And this morning the benefits of doing BW kicked in.  Kiddo was sick and staying home from school and last night wife asked if I could drive other kiddo to school.

I have problems with emotional eatingfood addiction and Im really sick of it controlling my life. I want to move away from fast food every day to home cooked meals but going cold turkey will probably result in my dropping the challenge pretty damn quick. I would like to drop fewer fast food meals each sprint maybe limiting myself to  times first then  then do you think thats a good idea??. I want to learn to eat a normal persons amount of food and cut back on boredom snacking.

Being thrown into a complete and total menopause was shocking both physically and mentally. I saw a  lb weight gain after adding hormone replacement therapy and pretty much losing motivation to work out. In that same time frame my mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness she passed late last year and I bought a new house with my partner. So...it is has been super easy to just make excuses.

2940429,0,t3_2tsjcd,DietEating Habits Im a mostly vegetarian. Most of the time I dont see the need to add meat to a dish and Im not personally a fan of most kinds of meats that I know how to cook anyway. Im always a fan of a good burger when I eat out though. I eat a lot of soups and a lot of salads with salmon on top. I eat quite a lot of carbs but I find it works for me either because Im a runner or because my body just naturally does better with more carbs.In regards to the topic of eating disorders I struggled with food for years. I had many habits you would consider disordered eating and it really did take over my life even if it wasnt a fullblown eating disorder. Ive been healthy since around August though and now eating is something I do to fuel my body not as a reward or a punishment. Moderation is actually key  make sure you dont go too far with your dieting its not a healthy mindset at all.On a lighter note yesterday was great! I got my run in before it started snowing and ate mostly healthy all day. I shared a cupcake with my roommate but it was so worth it and since I only had half I dont feel at all guilty about it wrecking my deficit.

3019053,0,t3_2uppm5,Yesterday I realized I should read my goals every morning.  Just go over them to ground myself.  I was trying to make goals I had already made and that was a strange feeling.  I did not not get my clothes hung up.  BUt I did hang up the clothes I was wearing so that was a start.  not the gross ones just my work clothes  My dog broke through the fence to the other yard this morning.  He has never done that to my knowledge.  Not sure what that is about.  He didnt go anywhere just was exploring but it made me panic.  We have a huge problem with stray dogs and overpopulation so the thought that something could happen to him is intense.  Hes chipped but blergh.  This morning after I go on the scale and sort of freaked I had to pep talk myself that its ok and a few days of intensity or badness mean nothing over the course of a long time.  if you do better  of the time you will see results.  Just have to wait.  Downward trends.Today I am going to use pomodoros to get massive amounts of work done.  woo.  All my billing.

I made him some artwork for the space above his bed something hes been looking for these past few weeks and he loved it!  Also we had a nice romantic dinner despite the  of snow we got yesterday so that was nice.  I also finished my Peds ER rotation yay! and am going to be starting an OBGyn elective tomorrow which is my last.rotation.ever.  One month from now I will be done with medical school!  Im so excited!So while Im doing alright so far with checking in every so often Im not quite hitting my goals very consistently.  For this week Im determined to at least get one of them done every single day  my daily step goal.  My usual process is that I dont checkrecord my steps until Im sitting down to have dinner which doesnt leave much time for me to complete the goal if Im not close.  To combat this Im going to check during lunchtime and see how much progress Ive made for the day.  This week I will hit k steps EVERY DAY.  If I make the goal I get to go to the circus next month ...Im far more excited about this than is probably acceptable for someone of my age....

I think the worst of the coffee withdrawals are done with because I feel good and alert.  I quit coffee last set at work but then started drinking a cup in the mornings with my boyfriend at home which led to drinking a can of diet pepsi in the afternoon! Its a slippery slope.  Heres me saying that Im NOT going to do that on my next days off so I dont have to do this all over again! My workout went well I always hated ab exercises but now I am starting to love them  its sort of weird because I always tolerated exercise but hated that burn feeling when youre really working your muscle but lately thats my favourite part and I get frustrated with exercises that feel too easy.  I think thats probably a really good sign of learning to really enjoy exercise! Today is Saturday which is historically a quiet day I have a lot of catchup things to do from the week with the goal being that I go into next week with my todo list clear and ready for the week.  I am pretty happy I made my social goal this sprint today my australian coworker told me all about octopi and sting rays and spiders and sharks from Australia so that was really interesting  Making an effort to talk to people instead of keeping to myself has been really fun and I feel a little less like I dont fit in. I wonder if maybe people just think Im standoffish because I dont really make small talk often when really its because Im shy and small talk really takes me out of my comfort zone.  Im still struggling but its a start.

I need to give myself a rest day from running tomorrow because my legs have been like old man legs for  days Im getting a giant blister on my foot and my feet just hurt in general.

There were sweets at breakfast and I had a slice of lemon loaf so good then there was a food truck at lunch and I had a chicken black bean and cheese burrito. I really just wanted the chicken black beans cheese and salsa and that wouldve probably been half the calories without the rice and tortilla.  calories later my tummy was really full and burpy. Then it threw me off of my food game for the rest of the night. BLEH.

On long runs lately Ive been bringing my hydration pack thats oz since it ends up being  degrees by the time Im done.  Today I filled it up a second time around mile  because I figured Id run out by the end and wanted extra water for while I was walking my cooldown up the hill so I probably drank about  or so oz. while running! I only carry water... sometimes I was doing gatorade in the handheld but I just really hate it. I also had  fig newtons plus a fourth one before I started and a gel while running today. When its cooler I dont drink too frequently  a couple gulps every  miles  but on really hot days I drink a bit more. Do you pass any little stores or anything where you can refill?

I have no idea what the future will be like for us because its so complicated being in two different countries  I dont have the skills currently to be marketable and find a job in Canada.

Sometimes I write in a journal so I can remember what those little events are and then if Im needing motivation I can look back and say Oh yeah I didnt used to be able to run a mile and then I could run  miles and now I can run ! Obviously tracking apps work great for this too. As far as finding actionsactivities that complement an overall healthy lifestyle I find that Im more motivated to take action when I know it benefits some other part of my life positively.

I just finished a book the other night! An AA book focused on different peoples experience with their higher power. I found a lot in there to be really helpful much more helpful than AlAnons lack of similar literature. During the day Ive been reading The Namesake which I picked up from a little free public library in my neighborhood. Im really enjoying it. For my nighttime reading I switched last night to Many Voices One Journey an AlAnon book.What TV show are you most looking forward to this spring? Like someone else I havent watched regularly programmed TV in a really long time. But my husband and I are working our way through Jessica Jones Man in the High Castle Star Trek Deep Space  and Im sure other shows Im forgetting.

So we started back in Scrubs just for something more light to watch.What is the next trip you have planned? I get to go to Orlando next month for a course for work. Im not complaining but I wont have much time on my own to do anything. But  nights on my own should still be enjoyable. Ill probably find some beer related venues to Uber to.

My local trail has no cell phone service and just goes straight out. There are no turn offs. Not a great place to start for someone new to running and prone to very sudden bouts of exhaustion.

This is my first round here and Im excitedhopefulterrified to start. Ive known I needed a change for a long long time now but I keep relapsing and making excuses and things are just at an all time low at the moment self esteem wise emotions wise physical state wise.Ive been binging severely since the beginning of the year. I have gained about  pounds in the last  months and I absolutely hate myself. At the moment I binge perhaps  times a DAY with an average calorie intake of . Its awful. I dont even know if its BED anymore because it seems to me like a food ADDICTION. Initially I would eat well for a week binge EVERY day for a week and this cycle went on and on and on. And now I dont even have the self control to eat well for a single day anymore. My stomach no longer ever feels the sensation of fullness until Ive eaten a collosal amount of food. Its seriously affecting my life in all sorts of ways and Im terrified I will never regain the normal relationship I once had with food. I dont even remember what that felt like.Anyway my overall goal for the next  days is NO. MORE. BINGING.To get there I will. Stick to  meals and  snack a day if necessary. Snacking is such a huge trigger for me. I just need to stop.. No more added sugarsconfectionaryice creamsugary stuff. These are ALWAYS the triggers of my binges. So were going cold turkey. Period. . Decrease caffeine intake to  times a week. Im spending far too much on coffee and funnily enough I feel like I need to decrease my tolerance so that when I do need coffee in the future ahem internship itll be extra punchy. At the moment I just drink it out of habit.. Get back into lifting. Starting the gluteal goddess program tomorrow after  weeks off the gym from pulling an ass muscle. . Love myself a bit more.I will check in at the end of Sprint  and hopefully the voices in my head telling me to pig out and obsess about food will have subsided a little...If theres anyone out there whos experienced something similar and has successfully recovered please PM me I need help.,90daysgoal,d7roizg,1,t5_2s0sd

My unofficial goal is to run a K within this round but mostly just to work my endurance back up to be able to run like I did this time last year. I also want to get back into practicing yoga. I used to practice ish times a week which was great for me mentally and physically. My goal is  days of practice even just for  minutes a day. Self Along with the yoga I want to immerse myself a bit more in meditation. Ive meditated a little bit on my own and its really helped me manage my anxiety and depression keeping the spike ups a bit lower. I also want to manage my finances much better putting more of my paychecks into savings and loan payments instead of spending it on admittedly useless things.

I want to get back into my blogging. posting  times a week and keeping my posts honest and legit something that got away from me a bit at times. I also have been wanting to start a podcast.

Made for an eventful evening. Work is... work.Get yo popcorn work gossip This is just kind of interesting feel free to skip lol. We started our new contract last summer in July and the new contract was an expansion of the team. So we hired  new people to fill developer slots and one of them was kind of a weird dude who always rubbed me the wrong way. He took months to find an apartment because he was super picky and kept taking off all day randomly to look at places. He never picked up any actual development tasks. He complained about things about GermanyEurope I dont trust my wife and child on the trains here because of... immigrants like wtf dude and we all just kept asking ourselves why did you even come here if you seem to have so many issues?? ANYWAYS in NOVEMBER he went home for Thanksgiving and just... never came back. He had some excuse about some medical tests or something and that story has evolved into some weird shit. Hes claiming now that while he was in Europe he had an accident and it was the dust from the airbag that made him sick? So sick he couldnt come to work? He was getting tests run with his local doctors and couldnt possibly come back and do his job. Anyways we found out that our contract is ending in July of this year and guess whos coming back to work?? This fucking guy. We think hes been getting short term disability HOW this whole time and apparently our boss is giddy that hes going to be able to retroactively get paid for housing here the whole time hes been gone.

Swore off dating as a teenager because I had seen what drama it had caused to my friends but then I met him. We still have wonderful times together I rant more about the things that dont go well he is a great guy and Im still headoverheels in love which is why Im still working on it. It might be a mistake and perhaps I should just let it go but our relationship is still much more positive than negative. I guess were both finding out who we are and we might not match that well in some areas. I wish I was in an emotional place to deal with it properly but I have never been insecure about how he views me and our relationship so that hit me hard. Im almost never feel insecure anymore but this is something new and Im learning how to deal with it. It takes so much talking and understanding but man its really hard when talking on the phone. However if we can figure out a way to spend more time together with which we are both comfortable Im sure itll all go back to normal. Its literally the only issue but damn I have connected it with some intense feelings and thoughts.Hahah its been on my list for so long but I can finally get some help in pole dancing class!
