322167,0,t1_cfdspnr,There are some interesting viewpoints for sure and I like to think Im a master at listening to interesting viewpoints the dayjob.. oh the dayjob.. but sometimes I am simply and utterly baffled by what goes on.

486508,0,t3_1zlptm,I have this problem. I have a hard time with empathy and I dont really feel much in the way of anything honestly so grief isnt something I regularly experience at a death. Death comes to us all. I even find myself annoyed at the wakes when all these strangers start telling me how sorry they are. But Ive gotten pretty good at faking emotions when necessary. So I fake it. In my cousins case I tried to offer sympathy to his parents but while his death was sudden wed known it was coming for the last  years. For my grandparents we knew they were dying weeksmonths before it actually happened so I had accepted it already.There is one exception to this. One of my few friends was killed a few months ago. It was the first time I ever really felt anything about a death the only time Id truly cried over one though it didnt really hit me until the wake. This is the only time I can say I felt grief but I still tried to focus on his parents because I had lost a friend but they had lost their only child. Though this is something Im still dealing with. I go see them on when Im in town to help them deal. I guess I get around coming off as insensitive by my ability to fake emotions when necessary and I try and keep the attention off of me and on the others so that they dont look too hard and also because I cannot stand being the center of attention. and on an unrelated note love the username,2X_INTJ,cfvkike,1,t5_2sw4h

1409785,0,t3_29ox58,How did the societal expectations of femininity influence your life? Throughout the different stages of your life    Society had less of an impact than my mother. She hated that I came home with cuts and bruises from climbing trees and running around very much like your typical boy would. I would say my femininity as per more societally accepted usage has helped me understand that I very much the fluidity of my personal appearance.What means the most to you in life?   Leaving a positive impact that will last beyond my lifetime. For me thatll be to use my career to continue humanitarian work.Do you think that being an INTJ influences your values? If so how?   Of course but I dont think it solely determines them. I highly value privacy but that is in part because I grew up in a family structure and environment where privacy was a foreign concept. I also value loyaltyconsistency of character. Wishywashyphilosophically hypocritical people typically get demoted in my totem pole of people I should be loyal to. To be clear I have no problem being kind and compassionate to those people but they would not be the first people I would choose to spend my free time with.Do you view yourself as a strong person with goals and successes? How has this opinion changed over time?   Depends on your definition of strong. I have multiple definitions of the word but I would rather use the word stubborn. Being determined throughout life has led me to being a successful student scientist and work professional. I think when I was younger I was more susceptible to pleasing others for their sake and not mine. As the years have passed I realized many of these people simply did not want me to succeed.How do you think your life would be different if you were a male?    Getting the promotions in both professional and social hierarchies would be easier although I think I would have a narrower perspective in life simply because I would not have struggled the way I have to come where I am today. People would be more receptive to my speaking style and feedback I provide because it does have blunt authoritarian feel to it especially when Im tired and dont spend the time rephrasing what I feel into a more femininely delicate manner expected of many tactful women.If you could educate men or women about what your life is like what would you teach them or want them to understand?     Our outwardly stoic manner is not an indicator of what we may be feeling. It is because we spend so much time putting thought in our interactions and the world around us that we feel just as keenly if not perhaps more than other people. We hate being labeled as overlysensitive because its damning both as a woman and INTJ.    ,2X_INTJ,ciszv8p,2,t5_2sw4h

I always thought it was because of daddy issues too and like you my dad was absent for most of my teenage years but I never thought of it as due to my INTJ personality which actually makes a lot of sense.Ive also had it described as being an attraction toward intelligence education and conversation.

3300328,0,t3_2xudxn,Its really great that you posted this because Ive been struggling a lot with my own depression the past couple weeks. Depression is very much in my genes. My mom and paternal grandmother have been on antidepressants for a long time and have had episodes throughout their life. My dad is also on antidepressants depending on how life is going high stress or low stress my dads sister and moms sister both have struggled with fairly severe depression and anxiety. So it kind of feels like the cards are stacked against me. Ive been depressed for at least the past three years although I remember as far back as high school  years ago feelings of apathy and lack of emotion. Feeling as if I was wearing like a snowsuit or some sort of heavy padding running into walls and not feeling anything. Currently Im newly married and jobless living on the other side of the country from my friends and family. Some days are okay. Some days I struggle with anxiety and panic. Anxiety where if Im in public I feel like everyone is watching me panic that makes me feel like I need to take deep breaths to keep from throwing up. On my depressed days its so much effort to get out of bed to do anything because youre walking around with this inexplicable pain inside. Nothing feels meaningful useful worth effort. The days are so long.I understand that my situation largely affects how Im feeling. When I was in college I had work or school for  hours a week and so much homework that I didnt have time to think about anything so that helped a lot. Now Im at home all the time trying to focus on finishing my portfolio so I can get a job but the more Im at home alone the worse things get and the scarier it is to go outside and interact with other people. Id love to be able to really enjoy my marriage and enjoy where I live now because its absolutely beautiful and honestly sometimes I do enjoy it. But that doesnt negate that the other days the sad or anxious days are absolutely fucking miserable.I have been taking steps to overcome it even though they dont seem to work too well. Im doing paleo which keeps my blood sugar from spiking and dropping and its also helping me lose weight which Im hoping will make me feel better about myself faulty logic or not. For a couple months I was trying to work out a lot to get in better shape and to keep depression away but progress was so slow that I started feeling extremely selfdefeated so I quit temporarily. I try to look to my faith for help but its hard to feel the effects of your faith when you feel nothing most of the time. I think the thing that has helped me most overall is reading. Being able to sit down read something be taken out of my life and put into the shoes of someone else. The added bonus is knowing that if Im reading theres something Im learning... Whether its prerevolution french history some sort of biology or just understanding what someone elses life experience was like. Also when things get really bad I walk to the beach. Its usually pretty quiet there because its small and part of a neighborhood so I just sit alone and relax. Its the one place I can rely on to help me feel like I can breathe again. Its so hard to be crushed by your own emotions when youre standing next to such a huge powerful constant body. As far as drugs go Ive never been prescribed anything for my mental health and Im wary to take anything. Im so so scared that any sort of medication would just make life darker or flatter make my depression worse etc. The only drug I partake in is weed. It helps a lot when Im anxious takes the anxiety nausea away. I dont smoke every day just when necessary. Generally no bad side effects although Ive been smoking a long time on and off so I can pretty easily assess what I need and not get too high.Side note my moms been on Zoloft for a while and it doesnt seem to mute her emotions other than make her less depressedanxious. I admire her so highly for how shes handled her depression because she goes out and does the things she wants. Hiked part of the Appalachian trail goes on road trips fairly often decorates and makes big beautiful dinners for the family when were all home. Shes always so incredibly positive. My dads on Abilify currently and all he had to say about it was that he feels more content and that mom says hes less mean. TLDR Im depressed too and it sucks.,2X_INTJ,cp4gpgt,1,t5_2sw4h

4939065,0,t3_3ibrae,Pretty sure I answered your question in the rINTJ sub but I have a few more cents to add...Im pretty snarky by nature but usually tame in when appropriate. But if I like a guy and get along with him enough I have no filter when it comes to sarcasm and snark. Im pretty playful not in a flirty way so I tend to pester sometimes. It really depends on who the guy is that I like. Like I said earlier I tend to place myself physically close to them and try to be around them a lot. I also try to find out a lot about them and bring it up in conversations not in a creepo way. And I also pay close attention and try to remember stuff they say and take that into account of how I interact with them in the future. If Im confident enough and have some sort of idea that he likes me back Ill ask directly and pretty much come out and say Hey I like you. Do you like me too or what?,2X_INTJ,cuh3xhy,2,t5_2sw4h

7016731,0,t1_d1913yg,I found my SO INTJ after she had given up on relationships. From time to time I can see her projecting her fears about past relationships on to me but I just gently And sometimes teasingly remind her that Im not them. This might be an unsolicited sort of advice here but. . .It seems to me that in general INTJ women seem to go after I guys. I think in a lot of ways I guys tend to look more E than you and that can be a little misleading. But I highly suggest going and finding yourself a true Extrovert friend or otherwise to initiate a meaningful relationship with.A big benefit to Extroverts Especially Extroverted Feelers   is that while they can be horrible and lie like anyone else. . .we have a tendency to think out loud about everything. You dont really need to look for subtle cues wonder if we are happy or angry or any of that. Dont choose a mate because you have the same interests. Choose a compatible mate and you will find you like the same things they do. Im the football and booze type shes the dungeons and dragons type. . .I love how creative and interesting that part of her is so Im doing more of it with her and find that I love it too! And now she is getting in to the idea of sports with me She likes the statistics and numbers the idea of trading people like objects lol. A lot of people say dont date by MBTI. . .well INTJ women arent a lot of people. For some combination it doesnt matter and maybe you can make things work. But you shouldnt have to work to be accepted and MBTI can help you find people that will enjoy you just because you are you. I wasnt in to MBTI when I met my SO but I could tell from the get go we were going to be fast friends. But honestly I would have NEVER met her if I hadnt completely left my comfort zone. ,2X_INTJ,d1bp0jt,1,t5_2sw4h

9491126,0,t3_5as4fp,My vote is based more on what I think of a candidates claims and whether I think the candidate might follow through on them. This includes not only whether I think they will try but whether I think they will succeed.My vote is not based on party alliance but by coincidence one party appears to fit my needs consistently more often than the other. I have a list of issues and a list of proposed solutions and I look for similarlyminded people. They dont even have to have the same solution if I think itll work as well or well enough.I dont vote in hopes of changing the way the electoral system is set up mostly because most of the solutions being proposed by people are in my opinion worse than the current system. Im not for changing something unless I have a reasonable expectation of improvement. I dont even have to be  sure. I just have to have a reasonable expectation.I form my opinions on the issues from a synthesis of what should work what does work and what hasnt ever worked in the past. For instance I have views on economic policy that probably arent typical for my genderpersonality because I have personally seen the effects on the lower economic classes. I dont feel bound to any candidate or party because my family always or because women ought to or because this personality type is usually. My loyalties are to my immediate family first. Beyond that we can negotiate.My vote is never solely contingent on my personal beliefs on how the country should be run. That would be useless because candidates never want to run it exactly the way that I do. My vote is often strategic... I will vote for the lesser evil or if I have no chance the third party that I most want to highlight...Theres INTJ and theres Female. The other part of my personality profile is what I like to call Slytherin. But its not like a Lawful Evil Slytherin like many of the bad guys in the books its more of a Chaotic Good Slytherin. The official test said Im Gryffindor but itd be more accurate to say that I use Slytherin methods to meet Gryffindorian goals.,2X_INTJ,d9izfx6,2,t5_2sw4h

I have Si people alllll around me dad and  best friends all use as top learning process so again probably use their methods more than I might on my own.I use my Fi well did not expect Se to be THAT low barely above Fe.I am perplexed that it scored my Ti so high.

Like...I stopped looking at trees and seeing trees instead I just saw shapes and light.It was fascinating but not really different from a true runners high or zen leftbrain painting zone. So personally I dont see a reason to do it more easy for me to overdo and get physically uncomfortable plus I have asthma and it really fucked me up coughing.Opiat drugs give me panic attacks at least in hospital context but it made me horribly uninterested in trying them again even in a hospital and mortal pain much less for fun.Anything that truly takes away my ability to retain a modicum of control over thoughts and actions is antithetical to my way of being. I would never willingly surrender that control. So harder drugs coke meth heroine etc all right out. Same with pills and whatnot.Alcohol loosens me up plenty so I stick to a couple drinks when I need to relax or cut loose. About the only things I would try still at this point in my life are natural psychedelics with an experienced guide for spiritual purposes. As to legal matters none of it should be illegal and certainly not criminal. I agree with the statement made above that it should be govt not having right to tell you know negative rights rather than granting permission.I am actually very passionately antidrug war and anticriminalization. I dont think the illegality prevents any use by those who will use it just adds danger at all points in the process including fear of getting help if it goes wrong and incentivizes violence against citizens on the part of the police. From both my moral and utilitarian perspectives everything should be legal.
