11456879,0,t3_63jb3q,I dont think Jess was really aware of the rape happening at first. At first she only cares about what is on the tapes and doesnt think it happened. Eventually she worries that Clay will tell everyone about the tapes because theres some really incriminating stuff about some people on them. THEN she becomes kind of aware of what happened. Her having the flashbacks her drinking problem is subconscious probably etc. Then she starts to actually question it especially when Justin wont have sex with her anymore because he knows what happened and he just cant fake it anymore. Then she starts smoking pot drinking at school instead of just at home. She starts skipping classes more than when she was just worried about where Justin was.All that culminates in her conversation with Clay at the end where she agrees to meet with him because hes the only one who tried to tell her the truth and supported her even when she didnt want to believe it herself. As for Justin a lot of what he says and does is to protect Jessica because he loves her. It makes him a shitty person but he does have a reason for the way he is. ,13ReasonsWhy,dfumnq6,4,t5_3ak9u

I see what Adam Driver brought to a seemingly shitty character in Girls and think that such a performance was needed here. Jessica is early on positioned as an antagonist and her character is able to swing so thoroughly into that position and yet maintain extreme sympathy at all times. I lost control and broke into a blubbering mess when she started to tell her dad what happened.

She likely had deeper issues that I dont think the show explored.However I also think its a good thing bc its encouraging a lot of people to really critically examine her her past the way she views the people around her the questionable nature of some of her own actions and decisions stuff like that.Edit not that Im blaming the victim just that I wish the story has dug even more into the things shed been through. ,13ReasonsWhy,dg83keh,15,t5_3ak9u

Tyler has his hit list of everyone in the school he plans on shooting Alex is nice to him by sticking up for him with Montgomery then we see him take down his photo symbolizing him taking Alex off his hit list. My theory is Tyler is contemplating shooting up the school but hesitates once Alex actually shows compassion.

I think it minimises mental illness by saying that someone would do something so drastic because a show did it. I will however admit that this show does get into your head a bit and if I were a parent Id be super careful about my kid watching it. I certainly have to pace myself with this show as it puts me in a weird mental state.

11692046,0,t3_65234n,This pisses me off. I was in Hannahs place once. I was horrifically depressed at  years old and still am clinically depressed but I have it under control now with proper treatment. I attempted suicide. There was a girl I had a huge crush on but would have being in a relationship saved me? Hell no. Medication therapy and exercise. You cant say that the love of the people around her would have changed her mind. You cant pin the life or death of a  year old girl on whether or not she has a nice boyfriend to talk to. You cant put somebodys life in the hands of one person. And besides once its gone far enough that shes actively considering suicide very few nonprofessionals would be able to give her the guidance she needed to come out of her depression. TREATMENT is the only thing that wouldve helped and it irritates me that the show didnt even try to demonstrate that at all. And that the fanbase this show has created is full of teenagers who think that there is one person out there who will save their life not really stopping to think of what will happen when theyll inevitably break up.
