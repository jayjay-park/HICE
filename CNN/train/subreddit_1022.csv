76979,0,t3_1ux6y8,Just got home from the range.  rounds not a single FTE or FTF. I shot fed bulk ammo mini mag subsonic and bird shot.. Shot  inch group at  yards keep in mind this gun came fresh out of the box no optics no pre cleaning. Not even iron sights or rights on this thing.   AMA feel free,1022,cen6y01,1,t5_2v7cn

514797,0,t1_cfyqawp,I barely want to kill anything but rabbits raccoons possums beavers muskrats Bagers skunks moles deer cows pigs. Ok most animals I can think of are a nuisance to me. If you havent cleaned a raccoon out of a combine after it tried to eat through the electronics or didnt move away from the reel of the combine you wouldnt understand just how expensive they can be. Cows and pigs especially cows sometimes have to be put down as a farmer I care more about animals then most other people. The statement as you can see rubs me wrong because Ive dealt bullshit animal groups my whole life. And if I could Id shoot the people that cut my fence to free the cows who then wander into traffic before Id put down anything for fun. Im pretty sure Ill grab a Mosin and keep looking for an ma until ammo prices go back to normal and I can buy a lr box again. ,1022,cfysaje,-1,t5_2v7cn
582096,0,t1_cg6f1rj,Doing it again absolutely means another but as of now with having only started this hobby about two years ago I have so many cool wants that I really dont want to start doubling up just yet. Getting it right the first time is important for me to be able to get the next one on my list and not the same one over again. With a  because it is very inexpensive in its base package makes it a very appealing rifle that can be made very accurate. With my financial inability to purchase larger Centerfire longrange rifles think . Lapua Id love to be able to have a longer given .LR ballistics ranged . The bull barrel would just play into that. Plus and this is just my opinion I think the bull barrel looks better. I may also be mistaken but wouldnt a thicker barrel add to longevitydurability?,1022,cg6fsub,1,t5_2v7cn

1837491,0,t3_2fdbpy,Ok Ill play the heretic monkey here. I dont fiddle with my trigger or bolt release or anything else.

I shoot CCI and this gun goes bang every single fucking time and there is great joy in that. You want to mod your shit? Fine you will probably be pretty good at it after you have done  or  I dont have time for that shit.

6043566,0,t3_3ya73f,Ive watched a video of long range practice using gong traps and some very modified s but it seems that if anyone else is shooting around you its still not easy to hear.At about  yards with my rifle Im not so much shooting as I am lobbing bullets. Ymmv.,1022,cybtisq,1,t5_2v7cn

6118102,0,t3_3zckas,Rail is easy just make sure you use some Loctite Thread Locker Blue  on the screws just a little. The rifle should come with one but I recommend spending the  bucks on a weaver brand aftermarket rail. They come packaged specifically for the .I had a Simmons  on my  for a while and it works perfect for it. The rings mine came with are for a rimfire rail but I recommend as above the weaver rail. Lower seated rings will give you slightly better accuracy with changes in target distance because of less height over bore but if you would like to use the iron sights as well I would recommend getting some seethrough rings so you can use both open sights and the scope. To balance the scope you might wind up needing a device to hold the rifle a tipton gun butler will do the job is useful and only costs about  bucks. You will also need two small bubble levels they sell kits of them in order to level the scope to the rail.For the bipod you will need to install a swivel stud in the front of the stock. If the model you are getting is a wood stock you just have to drill it in. There are instruction videos out there. If it is a polymer stock you will need a plate that installs in the skeletonized stock. Something like This The buffer pins are simple to just drop in. Some are all rubber some are made of some sort of polymers. The ones I use are rubber around a steel pin which helps it retain form better while still cushioning the bolt.The automatic bolt release is simple enough just check a youtube video on it.Good call on the bore snake. I recommend a small brush or a toothbrush and a big pack of qtips for cleaning especially since the tight corners in the receiver are a pain to get to. Wipe the brush clean periodically on a wash cloth to clean it. You can get a pack of  cloths at walmart target or any other similar place for just a few bucks. Keep some oil around too. I use Hoppes but there are a lot of brands. Hoppes comes in small clear bottles with a needle on the top for precise oiling which is useful but also comes in regular bottles too.If you want more magazines check ebay the three packs are sometimes cheaper than a single one will cost at some local shops. I hope you enjoy your rifle I love mine.,1022,cyl2c83,3,t5_2v7cn

6459586,0,t3_443gsb,When you do get your rifle and youre ready for your appleseed read this about  times over Especially the part about Fire one round THEN change mags.

6546065,0,t1_czwe5tk,Well the stock is  and Im factoring in spending at least  on a decent scope? Would this leave me with enough to do make a decent rifle?Also this may be a stupid question...but are the s like ARs as far as buying parts? can I buy an upper without a stock or barrel since Im already planning on replacing the stock and possibly the barrel?Ive built a few ars and pieced them together buying separate parts to get what I want. Can I buy  parts this way? I figured I would have to buy a whole rifle then replace parts as I went?,1022,czwezy2,2,t5_2v7cn
6849137,0,t1_d0sncpv,gt There are inventory reconciliation tools available to stores for errors with products.Exactly.  But that wouldnt apply here because it was a single item that should have contained  more item than it did but the system only has the single large item not the individual items inside it.gtbut if it were to somehow make it to small claims court OP would be handed victory.Dont be so sure.  Not only would he be out several hundred dollars even by winning the court may side with the stated policy on no refunds and see that it was a sealed item that the store had no way of knowing was incomplete.Also your ticket example is flawed and is the exact reason that policies like this exist.  Its way too easy to but ammo remove a few take it back and get a full refund.  Just like it would be too easy to pay for  tickets get  tickets put  ticket in your pocket and get a full refund for the  tickets.,1022,d0snnpo,1,t5_2v7cn

A ship near me had the regular version for  that I might get for a custom build base.Since I got the version with the flash hider I need to definitely get sights. I have a Simmons x to put on it for now. Since the takedown technically cant be free floated unless I buy a regular stock and give up the TD usability I figure accuracy isnt a  priority.

7881118,0,t1_d41vh2l,I agree with you. Temperature is the measure. It can be either of two meanings. Unit output or temperature. With a heater either meaning gets the same result.  With an air conditioner on the other hand unit output or temperature could be the measure and if you havent previously established what you mean when you ask someone to turn down the air conditioner you have to add a carrier along with it turn down the air conditioner its hotcold in here.  How about in a car? Turn down the air conditioner generally means its too cold in the car I know its really just turning down the fan speed. How about when somebody says  crank up that a.c.?  That generally means  its hot in here. We can put wheels on luggage but we cant have one meaning for turn down the air conditioner.  ,1022,d41wt9a,1,t5_2v7cn

9048318,0,t3_547agb, cents per is the normal price for CCI. Not a great deal but its good ammo for a fair price. Much better than standard bulk packs anyway. It should be fine to dump them out. They wont really get any dirtier from each other. If youre mixing with other ammo which I would avoid then yeah it could get dirty. Either way it will still shoot fine. Finally I prefer leaving it in the box as it makes it much easier to track how much Ive used and how much I have left. ,1022,d7zgoqw,3,t5_2v7cn

To try and eliminate things causing issues Im going to stick with the Federal AE switch to dry lube.  If that doesnt help Ill try taking apart the trimags and use individual  rounders then finally Ill take a closer look at the bolt and extractor.  Hopefully in that order Ill find a combo that works.  By the time Ive done all of that Ill be out of the american eagle so Ill switch to CCI and see what happens.,1022,dfzv2yv,1,t5_2v7cn
