2955930,0,t1_co3vurp,I actually find that I cant get engrossed in Pokemon games the way I used to.With the D view I keep getting lost in cities and the frame rate drops dont allow me to suspend my disbelief.I want to believe that its the technical execution and not that Ive somehow grown too old to enjoy them.,3DSGaming,co43qwr,2,t5_3654v
3130505,0,t1_com76t4,Ive been playing MHU for about  or  hours and it is very slow and rather repetitive. I thought Id give it a go as its very different from what I normally like and the demo was pretty cool. However Im finding the slow progression really deflating. I dont usually get much time for gaming any more and I think if you want a quick fix MHU wont be satisfying. Im thinking to tradein early and get something else but Ive already got MM on GameCube Collectors Edition and the next game I fancy thats coming out is Code Name STEAM.,3DSGaming,comh3k3,2,t5_3654v
