5895722,0,t1_cxseyj2,To be honest I had never played one before I got mine largely because theyre for the most part custom guitars. But after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews I ordered a Swamp AshWalnutMaple custom and its a dream. What they lack in brand recognition they make up for in quality. They post pictures from the custom shop everyday on facebook and so I actually saw what ended up being my guitar throughout the build process. If I recall correctly I had the guitar less than a month after submitting the order. I cannot speak more highly of these guys amazing instruments. Better playability and feel than any Ibanez or ESP I came across.,8string,cxsgorg,2,t5_2thnh
