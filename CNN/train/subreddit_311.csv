1877324,0,t1_ckfefgq,reminds me of a ben folds song about how he needed to write a song to fill out the album because his publisher required at least . more songs and he had finished one.I wrote original . because I just woke up and kind of forgot the actual song but was soooo close.,311,ckfesnr,2,t5_2qmla

3094278,0,t3_2vk45l,All the more reason to travel to red rocks or Atlanta or new Orleans whenever possible. Soak as much in as you can. I myself enjoy the end of a decade long tradition. The unity tour was fine but I was bored of the title. ,311,coipy85,2,t5_2qmla
3094727,0,t1_coicws2,Not sure why youre getting down voted. Its truesome of the crowds in certain regions are just not large enough to support amphi shows. Theyre last show in Portland was embarrassing turnout wise. The venue closed the lawn and moved everyone to the seating are which was  full. I swear when  walked out they were initially like wtf...?,311,coirmjm,3,t5_2qmla

4880847,0,t1_cu9ppq3,Nah thats a rendition. A cover is where you just play a song and karaoke is used in bars and clubs with a pre recorded backing track. This was a cover. ,311,cu9ro9q,2,t5_2qmla

5537483,0,t3_3quag6,Everyone has said very good points about this song and I agree its one of the best Bob Rockera songs and Imma let you finish but it has one of the coolest endings of any  song.

6684200,0,t3_476t4c,No. The only way they get in is if they have a renaissance with the mainstream again which I dont see happening. They are overshadowed by the likes of Phish Sublime etc. Those bands would get in before .,311,d0apdvg,4,t5_2qmla
7018504,0,t1_d1b9mfr,I think it is most likely that Amazon is using a generic clip for all versions of Hive but the album is actually clean. ,311,d1bwadw,1,t5_2qmla

7512313,0,t1_d2vj2e1,that says it was performed during Plain. Im assuming it was performed BEFORE the song though which would make it come right after Nix Hex? Anyways thanks for this!,311,d2w42dc,1,t5_2qmla
7703930,0,t1_d3g20pv,Good call I think Running and Its Getting OK Now are the only  songs credited Music T. Mahoney Lyrics D. Martinez and theyre both favorites of mine. Its Getting OK Now would be another good candidate for most underrated song. Its too bad that the few SA leadsolo vocal songs in s catalog are played live so infrequently.,311,d3hvw0z,1,t5_2qmla

10222337,0,t1_dc1brva,Oh yeah the customs creators thing? I found it and looked around but I think thats a bit more involved than Im going to be able to do. Plus they dont have vocals apparently for the  songs. gtshruglt Still really cool someone went and did that!,311,dc2rbws,2,t5_2qmla
10869658,0,t1_de0zjq0,my point is more so wtf ? than wtf radio? everybody knows the radio isnt the place to go for new music in . i dont know why  thinks were going to go there to hear the new stuff. no one besides people who already follow  are waiting for this single. just release it  on youtube on iTunes on Spotify  in places where people will actually hear it!,311,de14m0i,2,t5_2qmla

11051646,0,t3_5xt934,They really look like they are enjoying this new material. And I see what they mean about bringing the reggae back! Im getting increasingly stoked about the new album. Seems like they are hitting their second stride that I felt was so strong during the Transistor and Soundsystem days. ,311,dekoo3g,8,t5_2qmla

11538142,0,t3_64l773,Im really getting an Uplifter feeling here. Lots of songs tons of different directions. A bit dissapointing so far since I felt Stereolithic was the closest thing theyve had to a concept album in years. I guess they just have too much material to play with to refine at this point. Probably a good thing in the long run. Although I also wonder if Stereolithic was so good because a huge chunk was based off really older material. ,311,dg3umuz,5,t5_2qmla
