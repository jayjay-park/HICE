271553,0,t3_1x563u,My cents worth from my experience in lifting and Tim Ferriss suggestions Have you tried something other than drop sets? In my edition of HB it suggests a single set to failure at  reps. This usually means you are lifting approx  RM.  Your body learns to adapt not only to lifting in general but those exercises specifically. Change up your routine for  weeks and see if gains resume.  Are you eating enough? My trouble with slowcarb when I started was not eating enough. The volume of food you need increases with slowcarb more than many think. Are you eating a good macronutrient balance? As you cut fat and add muscle your bodys lean muscle percentage and base weight need to be accounted for. I wont advocate a specific ratio here but a common starting point is . grams of protein per lb of lean muscle. twice a month I calculate my lean muscle weight and adjust my diet accordingly.,4hourbodyslowcarb,cf8wnqe,1,t5_2sk62

Im not sure about your location but I found a few dishes from local restaurants that I could have delivered that despite their salt content were still on my diet. Upping my water intake with distilled water offset the additional salt. Roasted half chicken with spinach from a local Italian restaurant was a favorite.

2530548,0,t3_2ogudg,Everyone has this initial fear.  Think of it this way.  Cheat day is mandatory to ensure your metabolism does not slow.  Its also a creative way to teach you moderation.  To show you you can still cut loose once in a while and be healthy.The only thing you need to worry about is satisfy some cravings and eat a few big meals with lots of calories and things that spike your insuline.  some bread fruit milk sugar things like that.  You dont have to go so hardcore you feel gross.   You can even stick with the normal SCD breakfast and just have a couple cheat meals.  You can even have just one cheat meal!  Honestly if your way of doing things is to only dip your toe in the pool because youre worried youll become addicted all over again do just that.  You know you better than we do.  But no matter what you do make sure you keep the cheat day around a  hour period leave a good couple of hours between your last bite and bed and get RIGHT BACK AT IT the next day.  The most tempting thing on this diet is to turn a cheat day into a cheat weekend.  Dont do that!Otherwise enjoy!,4hourbodyslowcarb,cmovnmn,3,t5_2sk62

The types of foods you eat on slow carb are generally calorically low but nutrient dense and they also make you feel fuller for longer so its much easier to maintain a deficit than say if you were eating simple carbs all day long. Edit in other words fat protein and fiber fill you up and make you not hungry. Simple starches and sugars cause blood sugar and insulin spikes and crashes making you hungry more frequently. A good portion of pancakes will cause big problems. A big portion of fish veggies and some beans May last you all day. ,4hourbodyslowcarb,cprfzwd,4,t5_2sk62

6278276,0,t1_cz2lm8f,Happy to share some of my meals here are some of the recipes I use frequently soups stews and chillis are key Curried Chicken and Lentil Soup I just dont put the sweet potato in  Spicy Chili I only use  cans of beans  black bean  kidney and then increase to lbs. of ground turkey  Lamb rogan Josh this is a new one for me but very good. I would eat this with riced cauliflower but would be good with any vegetable on side and maybe even with lentils or other beans Riced Cauliflower This is a very easy side dish to make and is a great rice substitute to go with curries or any meal where youd want rice. I dont have a food processor so I just grate the cauliflower with a cheese grater into a bowl then heat it up in a pan with a little oil the article shows a couple ways to make itThose are some of my GoTo recipes but of course steamed vegetables with meat is a very typical meal.,4hourbodyslowcarb,cz39php,1,t5_2sk62
6280325,0,t1_cz3fu7i,I dont follow the slowcarb diet religiously so fruit is fine for me. If you dont want to eat the fruit just try something else. A remoulade might be a good slowcarb compliant option. If youre going for simple give the blackened seasoning a try. You can find recipes for mixing your own or use a premixed blend from the market.,4hourbodyslowcarb,cz3i3ul,1,t5_2sk62

7427945,0,t3_4gz80r,You looking for canned or dry? I would say you shouldnt have a problem with canned they have great ones at Trader Joes or Whole Foods and just check the ones at major chains to ensure they dont put additivies in them. For dry I would definitely check the international section as I dont see the dry kind very often. As others have said Goya carries them.,4hourbodyslowcarb,d2mid5k,1,t5_2sk62

8849592,0,t1_d7bkae3,WRT the beans I think its not quite  calories? MyNetDiary is giving g of cooked boiled pinto beans as ish... I see  cal per g for raw pinto beans but they absorb a lot of water when they cook.Id be happy to eliminate beans entirely frankly but I keep reading that you should have them. Have you had success with eating less beans? Ill try reducing it regardless.As for the beef um whatever is cheap. Usually thats been some kind of chuck steak thats a little bit fatty. Im going to try switching to chicken in any case unless you have some thoughts about it?Thanks for the reply. ,4hourbodyslowcarb,d7blfv8,1,t5_2sk62

8962725,0,t1_d7p1vpk,Ill agree with this. My general rule was having it at least  days apart. Recently I moved my cheat day to Sunday from Saturday since the NFL started and all I want to do is lay on the couch eating donuts nachos and pizza.

10462242,0,t3_5pu1hl,gt Any low body fat results?The author of the book.gt tried it about a year ago for  weeks and didnt lose much at all.. Thats not long enough to really establish a trend.. Is it possible there were errors in your execution? Why do you seem to conclude that the diet itself is to blame?. You did lose some. Isnt that a good thing? You didnt gain or stay the same. If youre just saying you get better results doing something else by all means do that other thing.gt I dont really see a point for myself to hop on it if i plateau at  percent bodyfat and allIt doesnt have to be a lifelong commitment. I dont see a problem with using this to get to  and then switching to something else if you need to for going lower. Maybe different things are more effective for you at different percentage ranges. The thing that gets you from  to  might not be as good at getting you from  to  first.,4hourbodyslowcarb,dcu02jr,5,t5_2sk62

11092831,0,t1_dep8wai,There seem to be a few possible things at play here. Ideas below are not in any particular order...Kudos for finding a meal that is easy to prep and the discipline to eat it regularly. That said its very vegetablecentric and doesnt appear to have much protein. Am I correct in assuming the chicken breast is bonelessskinless? Also are you consuming g protein within  minutes of waking? This doesnt seem to be a must for all people but some it really makes the differenceFerriss explains how this change impacted his fathers weight loss in HB. I might suggest switching out the capsicum for beans and figure out a way to get more protein and fat into the diet. Your pesto is probably fine. Also do you have a cheat day? How muchoften do you indulge?It looks like youre not eating nearly enough. Maintenance at your weight and height is about kcal. Im of similar build and Ive been losing about lbs a week at an average net of kcalday. The final thing to check is some additional measurements. My weight loss slowed for about  weeks but at the same time my waist shrunk about . The scale stagnating or going up could mean that other things muscle building are taking place and may not be a sign of a setback. ,4hourbodyslowcarb,depd22f,3,t5_2sk62

11303784,0,t3_61at2r,I just bought a few reusable ice packs that go in picnic baskets and cool bags. They usually go on offer at the end of summer. I think it does help with weight loss but be warned that you will start to feel warmer all the time so if thats something which bothers you it might want to avoid ice baths. ,4hourbodyslowcarb,dfd9mkd,1,t5_2sk62
