81838,0,t1_cenm53e,Oh man I take that back  I didnt realize youre working with animation.I work in product design and generally make barebone png renderings of just product models with their shadows. Then I usually make composites based on client criteria. Depending on the complexity of the product and the minimal scene that I use as well as the quality of the rendering getting a rendering with bloom may take a lot of time to work on later.,3Dmodeling,cenqv93,2,t5_2sawg

508472,0,t3_1zy241,I guess the first thing would be to understand the difference between the different types of maps and how they can be used to improve your modelUV map ExampleThink of a UV map as your D model flattened out to a D image. It is needed before you can do any sort of texturing work and defines how a flat image will wrap around your D object if you will. Its done through a process called unwrapping which I highly recommend you take some time to understandOnce you have unwrapped your model and created a UV map you can then use it to create different texture maps which each have a different effect on the way your model renderslooks ingame.Using this badass weapon by Josh Rife as an example Diffuse Map Example The diffuse map is what you would probably consider the texture. This is the image were the majority of your detail will be. Its usually made after creating by using your UV maps as a template and then painting over the top. There are plenty of tutorials that could cover the many different techniques for creating these better than I ever could. Specular Map Example Specular maps control how reflective the surface is and can adjust the shape of the reflection. These are usually a greyscale image where the lighter the colour the more reflective that part of the model will be. Normal Map Example Normal maps might be a little complicated at first. A Normal Map is usually used to fake highres geometry detail when its mapped onto a lowres mesh. The pixels of the normal map each store a normal a vector that describes the surface slope of the original highres mesh at that point. The red green and blue channels of the normal map are used to control the direction of each pixels normal.When a normal map is applied to a lowpoly mesh the texture pixels control the direction each of the pixels on the lowpoly mesh will be facing in D space creating the illusion of more surface detail or better curvature. However the silhouette of the model doesnt change.Hopefully this all makes sense. If you really want an indepth overview of materials and texturing you should read through ,3Dmodeling,cfy2e40,18,t5_2sawg

2280738,0,t3_2lby04,To be honest poly counts are less of a concern than texture numberresolution. Youll likely hit texture memory limitations long before you have to worry about poly counts unless you are making stuff for phones perhaps. Use atlases where possible in combination with modular wallroofetc. sections that can be duplicated. You can set up materials that mix things up a bit by changing colour tones adding overlays like damage etc. to help disguise repeating assets.,3Dmodeling,cltm7s9,1,t5_2sawg

Hes going to look at it and let me know if itll work. Thank you for that offer but I dont want you to go out of your way to do that. I know how being busy is and its not fun at all. I was moreso looking for resources that I may have missed. I see people come in here and say i need a simple model will pay  and its not simple and that shit pisses me off. I dont have much money but Im not looking for handouts. I wish I had more time to learn how to do it but I just picked up a fulltime job an hour away from where we live so I have next to no time to get this done.

3228206,0,t1_cowjury,You have to UV before it goes into Mari. Mari is solely for painting. Some software Modo for example has excellent UV tools others Maya for example do not. I used to hate UVing when I was using Maya but now its no big deal. If your current software is a pain you can look at some third party UV tools like DCoat Ive never used theirs but everyone says its great. That being said in Mari you just paint over the seams so having UVs cut up all over the place is no big deal The ship if I remember right is actually  UV tiles total and I have no idea how many UV shells probably over a thousand easily with the bolts. ,3Dmodeling,cowlwjv,1,t5_2sawg

6473371,0,t3_44auwf,Nice work thus far!  I personally think that you should have your demo reel on the front page always. Heres my reasoning behind that when an employer receives a link to your site they want to see your skill in the least amount of time. Having the reel up front makes it easier for them to do so. The demo reel is like a resume so that is definitely the money important thing. ,3Dmodeling,czow4p2,2,t5_2sawg

7358936,0,t3_4g2j9q,I dont understand what your going for here. Its an incomplete model with a weird drunken walk.Looks like youve got a stock female character and just added motocross armour for the chest. Where are the shoes whats up with the wing things. How does the armour join. Why is there no protection on anywhere but the head and chest. There is weird pinching all over your model too. Did you animate it in hopes of hiding these flaws as a simple posed Shot is better for feedback.It is a good start but it is no where close to completion. ,3Dmodeling,d2enskl,2,t5_2sawg

7987486,0,t3_4olq6g,Looks good! Only a couple things I would look at changing. First the grooves in the floor. They look to be a bit too wide or deep. Tough to tell from this angle. Second would be the area where the beam meets the wall. Maybe make a cutout in the drywall that the beam passes through?

8351490,0,t3_4twvbr,Not too bad. Its definitely a good start. On the model side you did pretty well. The only thing that strikes odd to me is that the arms are pretty long in comparison to the body and what you have for reference. I imagine you were wanting a somewhat top heavy t frame type build but as it is now it makes his legs look small. I would also advise adding more geometry to the folds in the cloth to help sell the deep wrinkles but thats up to you if you want to increase your poly count more.Texturewise its a decent start but Id definitely recommend rendering your diffuse map a little more and adding a specular and gloss map to really define the metal bits of your character. Creating a bump map is also suggested as they would help define the grooved metal parts or fold in the red cloth. Finally an opacity map for youre cloth. You have some semblance to tattered cloth on the model but bringing in an opacity map to include things like frayed edges or rips would bring in an extra level of polish.Looking good so far cant wait to see it finished!,3Dmodeling,d5lhmhw,2,t5_2sawg

8567075,0,t3_4x4n7z,Start with simple shapes and practice moving individual vertices. From there learn basic mesh tools like cut extrude.

9854569,0,t1_darav0p,Ive always thought that it was the moisture that fixed it. By getting the cartridge connector a little wet it would clean and bridge the contacts when inserted which made it easier for the game and system to talk. The gap between pins on the NES was fairly large which prevented bridging due to spit. Note that theres nothing backing this theory beyond my years of dealing with an NES.,3Dmodeling,das2n3g,2,t5_2sawg
