595774,0,t1_cg7ycbz,for some people like competition shooters every bit helps.

788265,0,t1_cgttfjx,Like others have said you can buy them new for right around the same price and know no one has mistreated it or monkeyed with it. You can buy a Tactical model for just a little more than  if you look hard enough.If you are set on getting this particular gun than make sure to talk him down. Show him gun prices on the web and let him know you will not pay full price for a used gun. I would want at least  off before I would consider the deal probably even more.

My ECO has around  rounds of FMJ and Ball through it without a single malfunction. I attribute this to the amount of hand fitting and the kick ass cone barrel system used in the gun. It conceals very well even under a Tshirt weighing in at  ounces it is only  ounces heavier than a MM shield and roughly the same size while moving up to a much nicer handgun and caliber. Its a awesome gun.  That being said the Kimber CDP we had was a jam o matic and the Kimber and the Colt have very very similar designs. ,1911,cv9jjiq,1,t5_2rtpo

5246623,0,t1_cvid0r3,You got it. So to expand on that there are many different dovetail cuts used on s. Different widths depths and locations. All modern dovetails are very different from the GI dovetail cut. The point being not all dovetail cuts are the same so even with modern cuts be sure the sight you want matches the cut in the slide. Unless you want to mill the slide which still has its limitations you cant easily at least put metal back on the slide so going from big to smaller dovetails is essentially not possible. ,1911,cvienvs,2,t5_2rtpo

6832123,0,t1_d0qp5am,Frame to slide fit is nearly meaningless in terms of practical accuracy.  Fit of the barrel to the slide side stop and barrel bushing accounts for  or more of the s accuracy.  I have a Colt Special Combat Government fully hand fit by a single gunsmith at Colts Custom Shop. The barrel is oversized and hard fit. The frame and slide have the same slight play common to all Colts.  The gun shipped with a test target with a  round group shot by hand not a ransom rest of less than an inch at  yards. This is a requirement of all Colt Custom Shop guns. It shoots as well as any Baer and is proof of how little frame to slide fit affects accuracy.Colts holds very precise and consistent clearances and tolerances that produce the best combination of accuracy with reliability in any kind of conditions. They are fit that way on purpose not because of poor manufacturing and assembly.,1911,d0qpzqy,9,t5_2rtpo

Condition  is the the real no no so you arent exactly wrong that condition  is also safe. The problem is that Im condition  in my opinion of course isnt much use. Since before the gun even serves any purpose you need both hands and a racked slide. This introduces potential for error and failure if the need arises to use the pistol. Carry totally aside Id you dont intend to have the pistol ready for use... It has no business being loaded at all ever.
