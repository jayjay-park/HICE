6102814,0,t3_3z17c3,I love this idea and signed up! Do you know when the emails go out every day? I woke up this morning hoping to have a topic but dont see an email yet. Thanks!,365PhotoProject,cyjbt85,1,t5_35yr9
6122679,0,t1_cyiyg1l,Sure! Basically unscrew your lens like youre going to change it flip it around and hold it against the camera. Its hard because you have to manually hold open the aperture thing which since its not meant for that is quite awkward and kind of hurts your finger after awhile. At the same time you have to hold it against your camera loose so if youre not careful it can move around. Plus theres no way to focus then so you have to just move in and out until something comes into focus on its own. On top of all that your camera elements are exposed so you need to be mindful that dust and other crap isnt blowing into it. It is SUPER inefficient but Im kind of cheap so not willing to buy a macro lens that I wouldnt use all that often. This works in a pinch! ,365PhotoProject,cyll2ex,2,t5_35yr9
