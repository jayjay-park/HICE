6885494,0,t1_d0wbmie,I dont know a specific release schedule.  Based on what was being shown at CES I think theres not really going to be anything new thats relevant to using a TV as a monitor.I mean its not like youre going to be seeing displayport on a tv sold in the USA anytime soon except for some really expensive Panasonics.,4kmonitors,d0wscxz,2,t5_31s8e

10172207,0,t1_dbwzqpd,Without  chroma text will be very hard to read and the display will in general look terrible for anything except video. So its important that any TV used as a monitor has  chroma.IPS is a better panel than VA aside from contrast ratio so it does make sense that you would like it more.Without a hardware calibrator its impossible to get it right just from messing with the settings there are too many variables.,4kmonitors,dbx2qh9,1,t5_31s8e
