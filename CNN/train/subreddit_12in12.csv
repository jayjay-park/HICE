6119064,0,t1_cykvt5i,You can totally change things up. The idea isnt about forcing yourself to play a specific game its about trying out and maybe finishing A game in our backlogs. Change up your order or trade something out. Youve got this!,12in12,cyl6a67,5,t5_3bimc

6341549,0,t3_417zo9,I just cant get into it. The story is good but I do the objective stuff first and like clearing my quest log but I cant do any quests because they require such a high lvl and it has a horrible lvlingxp system. I just finished the baron quest line and now am headed to triss Ive also done all but about  question marks because the enemyies are too high lvl and all doable bounty board quests and Im only lvl .Its also not what I was expecting. I was expecting something like skyrim.,12in12,czagp64,1,t5_3bimc
6586672,0,t1_d00kzfe,Basically for those games I just achievement whore. In the past with games like Sim City  I would do something like expand as much as I can and then try to optimize it traffic etc.. Which is what I did with Cities Skylines after getting all the achievements. ,12in12,d00m66w,1,t5_3bimc

10120595,0,t3_5kr2md,After making this list last year which in the immortal words of some old men on a grand tour was ambitious but rubbish.But it wasnt a complete wash.  games from the backlog two new releases and a mobile version of a game in my backlog as well as the one in the backlog so I did complete  games in a year. Also some progress finished in a few other games finally understood how a Souls game works for example so it wont be as bad when I pick them back up again in the future. Also happening in  a platinum trophy in Destiny of course  curse that game and its ability to suck me in.For ? With a major milestone in my gaming life here a goal to get to  gamerscore before November rolls around.,12in12,dbqpynd,1,t5_3bimc
10564786,0,t3_5r6a4m,Reviews are great even if theyre not read much. It helps you as a gamer really understand the game you just finished for better or worse. ,12in12,dd5mz95,1,t5_3bimc
10577127,0,t3_5rdmcz,Actually finished up Inside PS this past weekend and my other February game is Mass Effect  Xbox. I started it the other night and got through the first couple missions so off to a good start. Excited to go home and play some more! Im also still chipping away at Trails of Cold Steel Vita which I had scheduled for January. Slow game is slow.  Hopefully I can knock out a good portion of it this month  would really hate for it to bleed over to March too. ,12in12,dd6y54v,2,t5_3bimc
10638872,0,t1_ddd7e1w,Things are probably going to slow the hell done next month depending on how long Zelda actually is. I may end up playing it throughout the year alongside the other games,12in12,dddbgop,1,t5_3bimc
11381689,0,t1_dfm1xv9,Yeah Ive heard Megalovania one of the reasons why I convinced myself to buy Undertale. Also Cross Code looks good I may have to look into it once I build my PC.,12in12,dfm3ftu,2,t5_3bimc
11467861,0,t3_62gd3h,MGS was my fav from the lot then MGS. I hated MGS. Felt cheated with the introduction of Raiden and I didnt like the struts level either. MGS was average. MGS was brilliant but got quite repetitive. Looking forward to the new coop MGS game.,12in12,dfvvjf4,1,t5_3bimc
