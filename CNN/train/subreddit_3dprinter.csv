1221231,0,t3_283dxy,I printed one of those clips ppl use to close bags of chips and it worked!,3dprinter,ci70987,2,t5_2v6ta
2391441,0,t1_cm79yyh,Just to chime in about the hairspray  make sure you hold a piece of paper as you spray to block any electronics or threaded rod that is exposed on your printer.  Hairspray buildup can be quite nasty and I have seen it clog threads on the zaxis when dusthairspray combines over time.,3dprinter,cm7aff4,1,t5_2v6ta
3415249,0,t3_2za5o1,You could look into the GRRF XAs far as I know their printers are good. Youd need to do your own research though to confirm. That model starts at  for a kit. Their Filament is great quality and I have used Kilos of the stuff.Edit Build area of xx. Of course printing a solid block that size is not feasible but quite often Id like to have a dimension bigger than my x Prusa,3dprinter,cphk9mr,2,t5_2v6ta
4240431,0,t3_3205o1,Ive done quite a few mm figs with a PrintrBot Simple Metal with heated bed option. I would probably buy the  pack of nozzles so that you can get a finer one than the . mm nozzle it comes with. Also check out this guys models. Hes basically going through the Monster Manual and recreating all the monsters in it. He has a good collection. You use the download link and will get the STL file for printing need a free Shapeways account or you can buy his models through the shop. He got kicked off Thingiverse so I guess Wizards told him he can have his designs up on Shapeways which is great. ,3dprinter,cs3lnak,1,t5_2v6ta

5473919,0,t3_3q1jga,i wouldnt worry about it being that thin.  I have printed out stuff with thinner walls on my Prusa i.  Near the top of the model where the case widens sidewaysyou either need to have support turned on in the slicer progam or modify the model.    You cant go out sideways more than  degrees unless you turn on support which will build a scaffolding under it that needs to be removed later.  You may want to search for videostutorials related to the slicer your using.,3dprinter,cwbcewx,2,t5_2v6ta
6794910,0,t3_48sxqz,If they are d pdf files maybe. Look for a program that will convert to stl file.,3dprinter,d0mhrqw,1,t5_2v6ta
8387537,0,t1_d5gq4c7,Could you provide a few more specs like filament speeds used printer model. What software are you using?I would increase the heat a bit and slow the speed down. I used to get similar results with the speed is too high. The first few layers Id be around mm then increase the speed on the third layer. Other than that Id calibrate the esteps again.,3dprinter,d5pzn6h,1,t5_2v6ta

10267977,0,t3_5n0jnz,Most firmwares allow for adjusting the step counts in some way or another.  Do you know what kind of control board that printer uses?  EDIT  Looks like Monoprice uses Melzi boards running repetier firmware perhaps.  If so the section titled Steps per mm here    Should get you started.  I dont have any experience with this hardware.  ,3dprinter,dc7xjfz,1,t5_2v6ta
10459675,0,t1_dct5330,yea its a tronxy i just want firmware that works i have the auto leveling sensor on it but the firmware i flashed doesnt let the auto leveling work. Im new to the d printing thing so im a lil lost,3dprinter,dctpkdl,1,t5_2v6ta
11411980,0,t3_62v6cn,I dont know the printer your looking at but I can give you one piece of advice. What ever printer you get make sure there are a bunch of users and robust community that talk about it and problem solve together. The community behind your printer will make the difference between struggling and losing interest and banging out professional looking prints. So I would say its almost more important to research the community that is standing behind the printer than it is to look at the printer itself.,3dprinter,dfpjbj5,3,t5_2v6ta
11413715,0,t3_62v6cn,Some people here may rag on the MOD t but for me it has been pretty great. With any printer that range you are going to have misprints at least until you start to understand what your printer can handle.,3dprinter,dfpqf3b,1,t5_2v6ta
