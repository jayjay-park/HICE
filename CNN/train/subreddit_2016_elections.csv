The poorest are more likely to be Democrats and the richest are more likely to be Republicans so its seen as a poor use of time and resources to campaign heavily to either.,2016_elections,crzj12x,5,t5_34f7q

6432219,0,t1_czkmczo,Thanks friend.Ill get back to you with a more concrete answer when I finish this bottle of mescal. Its not a happy night in my apartment.But for now no one. Im really not as big a fan of Sanders as I feel I ought to be to campaign for him like how I wasam for OMalley. Clinton is completely off the table for me. I need to read more but Bloomberg might get my support until November. Or Stein. Or shit Johnson.I wont switch parties in the meantime but in November its a crapshoot depending who each Partys candidate is.,2016_elections,czkmogp,3,t5_34f7q

7281263,0,t1_d25t3yv,Your stats are obviously correct. Out of the  Kasich is by far the most electable. He has better matchup polls though we all tend to look at those way more than we should he has more cross aisle appeal he will likely carry the crucial state of Ohio etc.Trouble is the GOP does not need to split or even much of a splinter for even Kasich to be way off winning. Had he been the frontrunner as he easily could have been in a normal year and walked out of the convention with more or less everyone happy Id given him a  chance of a November win.But. To become the nominee this time a splintering is needed. Maybe even  of the GOP will be thrilled with him as a nominee. But if among the remaining  of mainly hardcore Trump supporters theres even a  fraction of the general election voter base that ends up not turning out for Kasich he has very little chance of winning.,2016_elections,d25txi4,1,t5_34f7q

7758914,0,t3_4lizve,Debates are useless. They tell us very little that we dont already know about the candidates. The media pushes them because they are good for viewership especially in this era of Trump and gotcha politics and thus increased advertising revenue. The questions asked by the moderators are generally stupid are rarely answered and almost never challenged when the answers are vague incomplete or questionable. Candidates like the debates because it gives them free airtime.  years ago they may have served a purpose. In the age of Internet they are a waste of time. ,2016_elections,d3o4nkv,1,t5_34f7q

9575471,0,t3_5c1sow,We have been betrayed the earth no longer belongs to those who fight to do the best they can for everyone and themselves it now belong purely and squarely to the load popularist mean spirited people who lie trick and confuse everyone around them to get what they want. I may not be an American I am in fact Irish but trumps victory has further reaching effects than many who voted for him have considered. In the end we voted for both almost equally forcing them to work together to govern the country and represent the people in the end we decided to vote for the lesser of all evils and the people we thought would be effective at running the country and rather than taking their word for what they would do we wanted something in between we voted with our hearts and minds. Trump may make you feel rebellious and safe but he has no experience at governing a country and will act how he feels or do what the loudest of you say. We faced a similar decision in our previous general election where we voted to either maintain our current government or reinstate the previous government that accelerated our recession. The world is disappointed in the American people but shamefully not surprised most in America considered Hillary Clinton to be the lesser of two evils why vote for the worse of two evils it confuses me. Trump represents the resurgent problems we are facing on this planet these being distrust between communities and races misrepresentation of core ideals and the worst of these a rise in humanitarian apathy and decline of empathy for your fellow man. This problem is far from selfcontained in the US the recent brexit vote and reluctance to solve immigration crisis in Europe proves that. The truth is as we as an international community slowly come back from the chaos of the global recession we are struggling to feel empathetic towards others and instead are quickly becoming more selfinterested and selfish. We see recovery as an entitlement that many dont deserve and are interested in ourselves first and damn everyone else. The incoming president will be relaxed on Russia allowing them to reclaim territory as they see fit and consolidating the power they hold in the Middle East. Under a relaxed approach to Russia we could see a campaign of appeasement from the US if Russia decides to reclaim any old territory whose separation was hard fought for by the people of these countries while under an oppressive Russian regime. Putin is interested in seeing a soft America so they can do as they please while they may cooperate in defeating an organised Isis army they cannot prevent the radical ideology of Isis from spreading in America or any other country for this matter. The only tools effective at this are education cooperation and tolerance of the Muslim community A very clear message has been sent to anyone who is part of or being convinced to join a radical organisation that they are not to be trusted and that they are not welcome these people are disenfranchised with feel threatened by and frightened of many Americans and the American government for being a Muslim. Another victory has been won for Isis ideology today as they want a more divisive rhetoric from politicians worldwide to make the job of recruitment easier because the we push Muslims away the closer they are to being convinced that they need to fight in order to live thrive and survive in a west that is becoming more and more hostile towards the Islamic community. While I am quite worried about what trump will do i just hope that the house of representatives and the senate will consider all trumps proposals long and hard and vote for what they believe not what is being screamed at them from the loudest of trumps supporters as this could lead to a disastrous consequences. To deliver this in trumps style I believe trump is a con artist and bad man who fooled many people to vote for him. He represents everything that is wrong in America and will make America hated again. His campaign has spouted nothing but bile and fear and has taught America to hate again we want something different we want to make America love again love themselves love each other and love the world again.     MAKE AMERICA LOVE AGAIN.,2016_elections,d9tdez5,1,t5_34f7q
