It can take a while to get used to but avoiding eating anything for a long period of time can take your mind off things and then eating all your calories at once is really really satisfying haha.

6470035,0,t1_czojfjz,The honest answer to that is no. I am generally not hungry after I have eaten. Maybe a small percentage of the time I just want to eat but then I find it pretty easy not to . I have pretty strong willpower once I make up my mind. I also always make sure I drink water before I even consider eating something in addition to my pre prepared meals. As I said I drink at least L of water a day. Probably more but I dont measure it I just drink about  ml bottles of water a day at work plus some more at home. And another bottle if I polerun. I guess its generally between meals. I eat lunch about AM I have a coffee in the afternoon about PM and by .PM I am hanging out for my next meal. If I eat that about ish I will be hungry again before I go to bed most of the time. And I wake up very hungry most mornings. ,1200isplentyketo,czojq0l,3,t5_37vp3

7226986,0,t1_d1zm6vo,gt Oh lol  I just wrote an entire essay on this in another thread! Heres a link!Haha  oh no! And it was a wonderful post too D Text for the lazyMy everyday diet and workout scheduleI have a strong black coffee when I get up cus its am and frankly caffeine is the only sane response to that and Im out an hour later. I run for between   mins split between two dogs and a solo run. I dont eat breakfast until mid morning. Its usually mackerel lettuce and homemade mayo. Dinner will usually be some sort of meat and green veg or salad leaves. Im training myself to snack only when actually hungry  either a tiny can of anchovies or homemade coconut yogurt. Truth is though on keto Im less and less hungry anyway. And Im with you on the alcohol  it will always be there but I try and minimize the damage by making my own.As for the question of exercise calories muscle endurance etc... Im not an expert but Ive been tweaking my approach to this stuff for a long time and Im getting much closer to where I want to be. I find now that I prefer to run when Im fasted  Unless Im planning more than the miles I dont eat any food before heading out. On keto its just not necessary for me. I did  in all yesterday and breakfast before that was one slice of bacon. I took some homemade coconut bites out with me but didnt fancy them and didnt need them. I took a bottle full of water with electrolyte powder in it  it was the first time Ive used it and the difference in terms of recovery has been awesome. For zero calories too! Ill be sticking with that I think Ive found that as Ive increase my exercise I dont tend to need the calories like I used to  its as though Ive got more used to it. When I first started running properly I was famished all the time and frankly obsessed with fueling my workouts. It probably didnt help that I wasnt keto then  living and working out on carbs is a vastly different proposition. As Im heading into my first keto marathon Im finding Im relying on the fats more than the protein to keep me feeling full and happy. My meat consumption hasnt really increased much but Ive thrown in a few new things lately  occasional coconut fat bombs and homemade mayo. I dont need much to feel full and nourished thank god cus calories  and that feeling is pretty much constant. My endurance is up and I love it. However if youre concerned about muscle Id suggest adding in a few oily meats  youll get the protein you need and the fat to sustain you.While I would never tell anyone what I think their calorific intake should be it should be noted that MFP is notorious for overestimating calories burned during exercise. Unless Ive done a long run hrs I ignore calories earned altogether. If I do want to eat some of it back well  Im not going to cry about it but I make sure it stays purely keto. There is always an ebb and flo  some days are super light oddly usually the ones where I really ran hard and some days I eat more. Its pretty much always between    cals.What has made a massive difference to me is learning to listen to my body. Im rarely really hungry  but if I feel it Ill have a coffee or lemon water first and reassess in half an hour. Sometimes what makes the difference is simply paying attention to our bodies  learning to judge the difference between what we need and what we want. This has always been the hardest part for me Ive had a few bingey episodes too and sometime we can feel like weve worked out so hard we frankly deserve it  but then we undo what we worked so hard to achieve. When I go off the rails and get kicked out of ketosis it can lay me out for days. I find as the benefits of keto become more apparent to me  particularly with my running  Im less inclined to break it.gt Get up early! It probably helps that Ive been a postman forever living with a guy whos been a postman forever.Wow now that must help with everything!gt Also I own crazy dogs  they demand their morning run. Its amazing how motivational helping others can be. When my housemate said shed help me run  but we needed to get up at  for it  damn I did it because I didnt want to let HER down!gt Obviously it comes at a price  Im operating  hours ahead of everyone else and Im sleeping in my bed by . Aaah  see thats the trick! Not sure I could do that. It makes me wonder now how early your early is!EDIT holy crap I just read your post...  am!!! Eep!gt Cant wait for Staple Saturday  Ill have to make a batch of something and photograph the process Ooh looking forward to that! EDIT gt homemade coconut yogurtI would love the recipe for that. Also does the mayo taste better homemade?Also what brand of electrolyt powder do you use?Love the tips about oily fish!

7444044,0,t1_d2obxc2,A friend of mine in Arizona was part of the protests last year against the removal and auction of the Salt River mustang herd and theyre trying to get legislation passed to protect the horses now.  I was in Nevada where the issue is that cattle ranchers are a huge influence and they claim the wild horses compete for grazing land so the numbers have to be kept down... which is ridiculous frankly if you look at the numbers of mustangs vs cattle.  The BLM rounds them up with helicopters a lot of them are injured or drop their foals in the chase and the penning conditions are just horrendous.,1200isplentyketo,d2oc9lk,1,t5_37vp3

If I feel I need something right after a workout I put cream in my coffee or drink kombucha.
