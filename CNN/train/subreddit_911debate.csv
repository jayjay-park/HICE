1652959,0,t1_cjnhjo8,gt The families formally asked for the recording to be released the FBI said they emphasize with the families but they felt the tapes would not condole them in any way.Which is exactly what I said... so were in agreement then?gt  In the  commission report it says that the hijackers made the decision to take the plane downWhich they did. They specifically say that. The point is not were the hijackers planning on crashing it we know that. The question is  were they planning on doing it then in that field? Which is a likely no. We know they were discussing bringing the plane down for a while due to the attempts to breach the cockpit.But what actually happened in the time between the last audible smash into the cockpit and the crash? We just dont know.gt I think there is a need to when the authenticity of the hijackers is so widely questioned showing all the evidence you have is IMO necessary.Sure but they have  in the forms of transcripts. If theyd released the audio then youd hear the tapes were doctored etc. Why do I say that? Because it has happened before. gt there would be no question on whether a plane hit it if just released the  videos they have.Ill be very clear there is no question a plane hit the pentagon. To even claim otherwise is to ignore almost all the available evidence about that crash.Now if someone wants to claim that it was a specially modified plane or whatever fine but there is no question that a plane hit the pentagon that day and anyone that says otherwise is simply not honest or rational.,911debate,cjnioyr,2,t5_32z4l
